ever wonder when the next csm meeting is they certainly dont post a schedule nor the minutes that followhmm i smell something with the same longevity as evetvahh well guess its time to recycle this thread back to the front

great points i completley agree fly a nid myself and am just training for a rev since it takes less time anyway
signed i fly caldari capitals but i do agree that the matari ships especially the dread just dont seem to be what they should be considering how much extra training is needed to fit one properly if it would be able to lets say fit 3 capital projectiles or 3 citadel torp launchers then i think that it would make alot more sense
signedthe naglfar needs both a damage boost and tank boost for the extra amount of skilltraining required to fly it this needs fixing
come on someone in a position to know please give is an update on when this is coming back we have been asking and askingissler
what are you talking about it jams just fine the exact same as a falcon with less range but you dont need a falcons range in nonfleet battles and who would bring a widow to a fleet battle
get this into your head a ship operating alone or in the presence of a very small covert gang needs more capabilities than their t1 variants not less these ships are not survivable behind enemy lines and no they cant jump long ranges they actually jump very short rangesblack ops ships arent logistics ships so your point of their combat ability behind second to their logistics capabilities kind of just proves my point c o m b at ship
also happens if you try and contract a ship with a damaged drone afaik this needs to be fixed though
wrong drones also have this problemtbh even tho ive had problems with this in the poast myself i dont want to support it when enemies take over your station you should lose stuff you shouldnt just be able to sell it from a distance on contracts wheres the risk vs reward in that
id point out to you that an outpost is worth somewhat more than a battleship id also point out to you that it affects plenty of people other than those who have their outposts captured  try having two hangars 3040 jumps apart and trying to contract a ship in the one youre not at its not as frustrating as having the whole ship unavailable to you but its still unnecessarily annoying
then make it true of any ship with any faction ammo or any t2 ammo why punish amarr i can repair drones but i cant repair crystals
this would be a great change please do itedit it would be even better if we could somehow have a default wallet for say mission rewards and bounties so say everything i gain from missions goes to wallet 6 while all the money i get from selling stuff on the market goes to wallet 5 or something

i found lvv to be an excellent delegate and was very much hoping to vote for him again this term especially with the midas expansion being next on the agenda
irrespective of who i or anyone else is going to vote for this is an outrage no age limits can be made any citizen of eve who gets enough votes has the right to be elected and anything else would be a scandalsignedmakes you wonderif there are elements in ccp who want to acheive something that has nothing to do with this age limit
assuming the nda is the issue and it has been signed by lvs parentsguardians and theyre fine with him carrying out his csm duties then i fail to see what the problem isif ccp want to introduce this rule then just wait till lv is 21 or make the rule something along the lines of all new candidates for the csm must be a minimum age of 21 this rule does not apply to existing csm members who have already been elected to their position
if you look past the rather selfish i dont like it when i cant pew pew jf in lowsec anymore and ask the question why can they jump out of highsec but cant jump inthats like taking the train and having to use the bus on your way backi wouldnt mind if jf could only jump in lowsec to lowsec or 00 jumping into lowsec and then cyno out is even lower risk then jumping next to highsec and then jump through thats no biggie to me really if you cant light the cyno in highsec you shouldnt be able to jump out of it as wellthere is a reason you cant light cynos in highsec to avoid caps jumping in and pwning concord but the only thing you can do with a jf is bumping another ship and thats itremember the erebus that was stolen by the serpentis it was stolen in highsec so this means factions are allowed to have supercaps in highsec it also implies that its technically possible to jump caps and supercaps to highsec so why would a faction not allow jf to jump back into highsec because you like to shoot them i do to btw
no jump freighters already make 00 logistics far too easy i remember having to escort freighter convoys from 00 to empire on a weekly basis now all that work is done by a couple of cyno alts and jump freighters which makes it practically impossible to cut off an enemys supply lines
theres no point in having a database if the information in it is wrong
there are good alternatives to be found but if they dont bother to keep it up to date they better should remove it
meh either update it or remove it i dont use it but having it out of date isnt good
agreed
sure why not have moms with mining lasers too
that brother is an excellent solutionhow does this figure change if the number of members in each corp is taken into account fwcorpstandingcorpstandingcorpmembercountfwalliancestandingsumofcorpstandingalliancemembercountreads rest of threadahh i see becq had already suggested taking corp membership into account here
ccp or whatever should manually put rp alliances who request it into fw then random alliances cant join to blob it but rpers get to rp
while it sounds good in principle how do you quantify it what do you have to do in order to qualify for the official rubber stamp of roleplay alliancewho do you let in and who do you turn down just where do you draw the line
i couldnt comment on that not being a rper myself just the alliances i think of when i think of rpers  ushrakhan electus matari pie cva star fraction doubt they would join fw though etc
you fail to see that nearly the entire fw population is against this yet you find a few supports here worthy to push your personal agenda wow you are blinded by your jade onlinetry running your wealthy alliance sov towers outposts and maintaining 00 space inside a corp disbanding an alliance for fw gives them all the power to be a part of fw and not just be an alliance instigator inside fw there are ways you can be a part of fw i suggest you do it alliances will break fw completely theres absolutely no reason for an alliance to be involved none
not true in the slightest some of the long list of supporters in this and similar threads include pie 17tw ammatar free maak and other major players in fw in addition the entirety as near as i can see of the rp community supports it including cva em and uk besides one or two members from slackers and a handful of individuals unwilling to display affiliation who do you see against it as to jade well sf has publically declared all militias red based on their own politics so i think its reasonable to claim that jade is not doing this for personal motivations but because jade as an rper understands this to be a necessary change for the whole of the rp communityright theres absolutely no reason for groups such as electus matari and ushrakhan who have been central to the freedom fighting business since before 99 of fw players started playing to be involved in the war against slavery no reason at all for cva who has arguably done more to expand the borders of the empire at least in an rp sense than anyone else alive in the empire for being allowed to participate in the reclaimingnone at allsarcasmthe problem here is that you seem to think that every alliance in the game is bob or goons most alliances are considerably smaller and most of the alliances that would even care to be in fw hold no space exception cva and the huge alliances that could get involved just to screw with things  can already do so the goons wouldnt need to join fw to park their capital fleets in the bleak lands they could do so tomorrow theres a reason they dont
dual yes thank you as becq starforged said it can be easily nerfed to take out any shananaginsis equal and fair to all as statedyes it has been brought up before with the current news article it was time to push the importance of this gainthere is no reason why not to do it
dual as said duel means grinding for exp and thats one thing im thankfully glad eve does not haveanyway i agree and so do many othersas stated in the many other threads there needs to be an approach along two different pathsa backup skill once your initial skill completes it automagically begins training the second skill youve defined as your backup skill generally a nice long skillb 24 hour skill que this would allow you to select existing skills not skillbooks totalling 24 hours with the final skill allowed to surpass the end of the timer this would be perfect for those short skillsc dual training  i personally do not go for this as it slows down the progress of both skills and is no better than the current system
while i am in favor of a skill training queue i have a hard time following your logicthe existance of a eula violating macro that contains a trojan is not a sound reason to ask for a change in game mechanics
if people are desperate enough to work around your game mechanics via a mechanism likely to put a virus on their computer perhaps thats a sign that your game mechanic is frustrating and thus possibly changeworthy given that this isnt an issue of balance or anything of the sort and the frustration is entirely needless there isnt a very good reason for them not to change it seriously it makes players log in wtf im not sure if thats the ops logic here but its at least a plausible bridge from a to b
every patch seems to make the mail length shorter and i have problems with it on a regular basis i used to have a nice bio too but then that got chopped by ccp longer ship names would be good too not huge but a bit longer please
fix this if ccp care about disk space that much then they should upgrade but compression could be implemented clientside for anyone complaining about lol lag
my first minmatar char was a sniper tempest pilot since 2004 and now that i have this one i have all the base gunery skills fived out and still havnt gone tempest yet when the tempy got quake ammo i was wrecking for 3k plus dmg then quake and all yes t2 ammo  got slammed and now its largely useless unless your sitting right next to a capital and shooting at him i think tht overall artillery had a kind of shock factor b4 but now its mock factor  im sorry but when a 1400mm projectile comes crasshing into the side of you ship it should make an impression 
im not saying that it should change to an i win button im admitting that this in fact is how things are thus one should adapt but neither am i saying that the fact that things are this way is a good thing

100 signedtj
i dont think anyone would disagree that there should be consequences to pvp but being able to lag a system to death should not be an instant win couple that with the fact that you basically never get reimbursements due to lag and its a recipe for blobs
signed
the concept that ccp cannot or will not reimburse ship losses when their hardware failed because it would set a dangerous precedent is ludicrous ccp needs to own up to the fact that their troublesome goal of supporting and actively promoting massive fleet battles on said weak hardwaresoftwarenetwork is a max fail and reinstate these pilots ships be men and have honor battles should be won and lost fairly not on the failure of your game due to poor planning and crappy support
i agree with shinma and its not about loosing the ship its how we lost them i would gladly loose a ship in combat thats fair and where we are able to fight back but when you stare at a black screen for 4 hours only to see damage notifications but nothing else is not how you want to loose a 3 billion isk investment
signedif you cant fix the problem yet fine but dont insult your paying customers
i have the expectation that for my monthly fee i will get to play a game that works as advertised if the game fails as it did yesterday ccp owes its clients reimbursement as well as an apology and corrections for the future
signed
agree very much
signedfix it you cannot be killed if you have not yet arrived
am unlucky and have loaded grid to a pod 3 times this weekwhatever faction and whatever ship size you are using it is a terrible way to lose any size of shipsigned
100 per agree ccp will never do anything as long as we pay aor bill each mouth
this is not the current policy it has always been the policy since it has worked for 5 years there is no need to fix it new eden is a harsh and unforgiving place learn to live with it
eve isnt free i pay a monthly fee to a company and that company makes a profit from that said fee eve is advertised as a game that provides both large and small fleet battles and everything in between any company that took money from a customer and didnt deliver what they advertised that product as would be obliged to provide the customer with some sort of refund or reimbursement in this case the players ships the 1000 fleet battle in mo i dont think anyone bob or nc is going to argue that the server performance doesnt live up to the expectations that eve presents you as you sign up nice post shinma
i heartedly agree node crashes are unacceptable therefore all ships should be reimbursed
i have learned to live with it its the part when im trying to get into new eden thats bothering me
signed
little logic problem logging more data to check if the player had not loaded when killeld use up more server capacity and database capacity using up more server capacity will reduce further the size of usable fleet as people will not reduce the fleets more crashes will occur end results more ship losses longest petitions queue ship are reimbursed after months option 2 data are stored player side some player discover how to hack the data day 2 of the change no one ever loss a ship in pvp
invert step 3 and 5 and what you getyour ship will lock and start firing before being registered by the other players so you will need a step 6 ship is frozen and invulnerable until all other ship have acknowledged his presence on grid but at that point you can simply say ship will never load in a fleet battle
i fully endorse this suggestion
not signedthere are already too many caps in eve if anything should be done caps should not be insurable or reimbursableif you bring them or any other ship into a lagfest thats your own problemedit oh and 68th in an nc whine thread
not supportedloose a battle due to your own incompetence and then want the ship back lolim wondering why is there no bob posters supporting this issue they never lost a capital ship  or they just dont whine next time bring more that should solve the problemand if you loose youll just get them back now thats an idea 
nobody has a problem loosing in an actual fight the problem here is there was no actual fight we got to stare at a blank screen for 4 hours but i bet you wouldnt mind loosing a 2b plus ship that way huhplease visit your user settings to reenable images
if i couldnt afford to fly one i wouldnt bring itif i had a fc that will just cyno in at a gate i wouldnt take part in the fightnot only you had a blackscreen keep that in mind
understandable everyone knows that the golden rule in eve is not to fly something you cant afford to loose thats not the issue here personally i had bought a new carrier and had it fitted and back up in tribute as soon as i was finally able to load into my medical clone the point of this is that anyone who looses a ship this way shouldnt just be expected to eat it honestly if the gbc posted something like this should they have lost ships in a situation like this i would support them in saying they should be reembursed as well we may be enemies in game but that doesnt mean they deserve to have thier ingame experiences ruined because of a hardware problem thats outside of their control
oh dear
adding one reply packet to the end of the initial gridloading data stream to makeconfirm player intractability is hardly going to cause a bump in server performanceit might be hacked is hardly a good reason to not fix such obvious issuesimplement properly and it wont get hacked without a lot of effort
ive heard this and similar statements quite a lot last weeks but it is not true ccp wont lose accounts if the gtc prices go uppeople dont understand that they cancel their account because of a high gtc price and think there is one subscribed account less because of this but thats not the case the gtc which they would have bought is bought by someone else only the gtc generates money for ccp and the number of gtcs dont become less if you dont get onethe gtc market is currently a sellers market every gtc that is offered will quickly find a buyer there are more buyers than sellers not every buyer will get a gtc so some will offer to pay more in order to get the gtc instead of another buyer thats why the price is rising if ccp would put up a fixed price this wouldnt help you there would still be more buyers than sellers and some buyer would still get no gtc probably the sales would be done to people the sellers know as favour or people would offer additional isk inofficially to get one of the few rare gtc this would create lots of mess no benefits
it is a nice option to buy game time codes with ingame currencyit is not a guaranteed right to to get them cheapif you want cheaper gtcs on the market you have to buy gtcs and sell them cheapbut why would you do that you wouldnt and if let me know so why would anyone else people demand the price that is paid part of any capitalism
this was something ccp proposed as possible pre empyrean age but it never materialized
a great new industry and fits well with eves back heart i like it

no whats next salvaging rigs from wrecked shipsjust no
no reprocessingreprocessing homeless slaves fugitives and slaves to make frozen food soilent green is people about the op i dont think it is a good idea to salvage implants from corpses it is just not credible the state that such a body will be in and the delicate nature of implants just makes this practically impossible after all if you could retrieve them from dead people you could also retrieve them from living people which now you cant once installed it is lost never to be retrieved again i think that is good for things with such an impact like rigs and implants
yes thisim not sure if rigged ships give more components to build rigs again but if they dont then they should aswell

as the header suggests this concerns command ships in relation to their t2 bc counterpartsare there any csm who have tried to champion the cause of the cs particularly the nh or are interested in doing sofailing that does anyone know if since the advent of the t2 bc any dev has commented on the usefullness of this class in relation to the newer bcs i know ship ballance tweaks are few and very far between i really dont know why this is but i would like tofor instanceto shamelessly rip off another dudes poststabber powergrid 700 nighthawk powergrid 710sleipner powergrid 1460 1 hislotnh simply dosent have enough pg to fit vital mods in pvp having only 5 meds give it no ability to tanktackle that the drake does and its lower hp and less rigslots than the drake means it dosent really passive tank all that much better either you cant active tank it either since with an mwd it also needs a cap injector as well as a lsb which is complete overkill for the powergrid even attempting to fit hams is futile dont even try to fit a command module this ship classs supposed nichesimply put the nighthawk dosent do anything a ham drake couldnt do and it cant even tackleplease also look at command ships in relation to their t2 bc counterparts and tell us whether or not a gross infringement of class niche has occured across the board or individually
if you cut nighthawk optimal to sleipnir level sure buff it grid like 2km optimal oin your nightfall hope so
and the nh gets the same speed  agility and dps as the sleipnir as well right
lol yea and the ability to fit a practical xlarge shield booster tank with high amounts of dps its very imbalanced
current imbalance is inzealot  absalutioncerber  nighthawkboth are missing 1 turret vaga 5 turrets sleipnir 7 deimos 5 turrets astarte 7 but both nh and absolution have 56 turrets
yes because balance is decided by pretty patterns of numbers rather than by considered examination of combat utility seriously though the nighthawks pg is hopelessly inadequate and the ship is unusable in its intended role in pvp the csm has however voted through this issue and will bring it to ccps attention soonbut really all of the field cs have problems to some extent the sleipnir is best off being able to fit a gang mod xlsb and weapons this would take 5 rcu iis on the nighthawk but all of them have problems fulfilling their role
you do not understand computer security passwords or the way they are storedwith the correct settings your pc will prevent you reusing an old password the network at your office should do the same so should all the websites you use they should also tell you to change your password on a regular basisthis is good security practicepasswords are not stored in plain text they are encrypted to prevent people looking at them this is as true of your windows pc your work servers and eve as it is your bank so the devs cant find out your passwords ok thats a simplification but its very difficult for them to do sousing the same password for multiple accounts is bad security practice rotating a set of 3 or 4 passwords when youre told to change them is very bad security practiceso ccp should continue their practices and you really need to change yours quick before someone steals your money by hacking your gmail account
sighlets say ccp uses sha1 for hashing thats pretty much as generic as you can get these days if you can produce a collision within a reasonable amount of time then you should go publish it in a paper somewhere and you will be world famous youll also be targeted by intelligence agencies all over the world but its the price of genius i guesseven if you produce that collision and become world famous  kidnapped by the nsa its a hashing function so even collisions wont probabilitywiseget you anything usefulin the mean time i stick with my opinion that you are just terribly misinformedediti just saw again your post on the first pagei seriously think you should listen to your own adviceps qft makes no sense in that last sentence learn internet acronyms
and thats great assuming you can give everybody the ability to remember a large and evergrowing number of wholly random strings of nonspecific ascii in reality what youll get is the aforementioned list of all passwords sitting on the persons desktop in plaintext theres a reason people hate password security and its because theyre not capable of meeting your rules for that matter i have one of the best memories for that sort of thing of any person ive ever met  every card number in my wallet is memorized after about three uses  and i dont even try to implement proper password security because i cant do it your ideas of password security are right up there with communism  great in theory so long as your theory is wholly untainted by contact with reality

is this referring to hilmars presentation anout using supercomputer technology to build a new server systemwhile id like to hear how its going he was talking about that taking a long time at fanfest as they have to develop new technology to make the thing reality it wasnt just a case of buying the hardware and plugging it in so im not at all surprised that they havent revealed anything new since
this the mechanic shouldnt convert slaves into freed slaves it should collect slaves and provide  something perhaps lp or standings in effect the slaves are being retrained and returned to npc society if they are returned to the players as freed slaves they are still livestockand yes the mechanics are already there in the form of cosmos trade agents just drop a cosmosstyle freedom camp out in amamake with a agents that accept slaves freed slaves elite slaves kameiras etc in exchange for lps and the matari part of this is done the amarrian equivalent slavetraining facility would accept refugees and the like since the gallentecaldari war is a little less idealisting perhaps they are looking for refugees their citizens captured behind enemy lines militia pows and similarid also like to see these sorts of commodities dropped by fw complexes which could tie into a minor set of rewards for those participating in the system capture portions of fw by adjusting the drop rate per complex and the lpwhatever reward per commodity it should be easy to make the rewards become an asset to fw participants without becoming a getrichquick scheme
i mean it doesnt sound right to you but you really need a simple basic optout from war decsthere is no reason to stop a solo players gameplay because somebody wants wardec lulz
sage goes in all fields
it is so hard to add this to one of the bazillions other thread about the same idea instead of opening another one
yes there is that solo player willingly downloaded and paid for a pvp centric game if thats not what you want maybe your game is still out there
maybe some solo players do pvp or are you so obsessed with making a bigger blob every day and seeing how many nodes you can crash that you forgot what pvp is
yes its a pvp centric game not a pvp mandatory game if thats not what you want maybe your game is still out there
best solution to the problem would be to remove the effect of the qlevel and of the system security level of the system from the lpisk rewards paid out by the agentinstead implement a multiplier like thishighsec 1xlowsec 2x00 3xthis would make all l4s in the same security zone give exactly the same rewards and you could choose freely where you wanted to mission if a mission hub became too crowded you could just movewould ofc also work for l13s but this is not too important
that is a good idea
im not sure why they dont do this already there is no measurable difference in safety levels between 10 and 05 or between 04 and 01 the only differences are between highsec lowsec and nullsec i would suggest basing the reward on the secstatus of the mission location though rather than the agent mission an agent on the border of lowsec should give increased payoffs for their missions that take the pilot into lowsec
same here amarr are great to mission for it just requires a half hour or so looking through eveagents and a map btw i think i know the system youre talking about theres a rather nice cluster of amarr l4 agents together there 
this would be awesome
if this means removing agents from high sec dont even bother trying to propose ithowever if this leaves high sec untouched and only affects 4s and 5sfine i dont see a problem with it going out there to lowsecthe only issue is the extortionists and pirates would have even more prey than usual but on the upswing no concord interference means more baiting of those same pirates theyd have to watch there backs  o would make for an interesting industrybut dont nerf the agents in high sec unless i misread it
im pretty sure he means alliances having the ability to hire new agents not move around the old ones it shouldnt affect highsec at all unless its to move players out of it and towards nullsec
its got my vote thenprovided high sec remains untouchedi realize that alot of you pros want more peeps out there in null sec but you will never get them all out of theresome people are just not into eve in that fashionhowever with the climb in stupidity reaching epic levels in high sec suicide ganking mission ganking wardecgreifing etcetcetc i suspect more will be showing up just for the change in scenery and not getting bound down by concord rulesso yeah thumbs up

please can we get the alliance logo submission process back up and running been a long time down with no update on when its likely to be back other than when its ready not the most useful response even if it is accurate
theres already a loong thread on this
other than the wtf surprise ball of hell at the end of the trailer and the blaster fitted on the pheonix the trailer was kinda okay in displaying eve however for the sake of accuracy i believe that it is imperative in showing people who may be interested in the game what they are getting into so it wont be a surprise when they get involved in iti simply propose the new empyrean age trailer which will replace the current one be 3 minutes of an entering space screen then it will end with the cool welcome to eve online the same soundclip used in those tv commericals it seems to be an effective way to weed out possible new players who would totally not get eve by showing them what they will be seeing when they first play that way instead of the forums being spammed by lag victims we will have a playerbase who can patiently wait through the lag possibly by getting a hobby like painting warhammer figurines at their desks or perhaps alt tabbing out and reading digg good for ccp who can scrap stacklessio and save money since the playerbase wont care

i can think of two rewards for capturing fw systems currently those shiny medals you get on your character sheet and the knowledge that your cause is winning the war surely you dont need more than that if you fight for rewards youre mercenaries not militia membersthat said i do like your ideas preventing militia members using station services when the opposing faction contests the system makes good sense and is similar to the situation if you find yourself in a captured outpost in 00
i just shoot my wrecks
post retracted due to policy change by ccp
cool thanksif i could remake the thread id probably rework it as a general citadel issue fixpossibly with a reduction of the explosion radius of them as well or maybe make pos modules targetpaintable theyre grossly inefficient at shooting guns atm explosion radius buff is offset by the ridiculously small explosion velocity fedos can run faster this is in itself another shortfall of the torpedo thats exascerbated in siege mode maybe axe the siege mode penaltybut the smartbomb thing is just ridiculousif thats the only part that gets fixed from this go around itll be a nice improvement
irrespective of who i or anyone else is going to vote for this is an outrage no age limits can be made any citizen of eve who gets enough votes has the right to be elected and anything else would be a scandalsignedmakes you wonderif there are elements in ccp who want to acheive something that has nothing to do with this age limit
this would be about the worse thing for new players ever  you will shelter them in the early days when they basically pvp on a lvl playing field just against similar sp pilots making them feel nice and safe in their ignorance then when they feeling uber in a bc or a bs with 3 mil sps or whatever you turn them out of this safe hunting ground of low sp players and low and behond a pilot in a cruiser or even a frig comes along and tears them a new one losing them a expensive fit bc or bs thus pulling the rug completely out from under their feet and making them drown in the knowledge that all the learned up to then is not a lot of use and they got to go back to frigs and cruisers themselves as just lost all the ships and isk they made up to this point better they put a time limit on being in npc corps and get players in player run corps where they can learn the trade they choose under guidence and mentorship of others

i just think its absolutely hilarious that weve gone from complete transparency of the csms work to voters as in the program text to im not at liberty to say any kind of update one way or another all within the couple months since the program was started really though it makes perfect sense im sure ccp are just terrified of the sheer scope of market speculation into these tech 1 capital ships that could arise if they were to you know acknowledge that theyre working on balancing a ship or something we could be seeing i dont know 17 or maybe even 2 billion isk prices for these ships and people actually buying them
signed beef up the minnie caps its long overdue training in general twice as long as other races with our mixed tanks and dual weapon systemending up with the joke of the game ship isent promoting a balanced game with everyone training for revs and morossand a little offtopic redo the ragnarok grafic plz looking at it makes baby jesus cryin general you must have outsourced the task of creating minnie caps they are in almost every way the biggest flaw in this game it looks like its chinese child labours that did the job
ccp should just inlcude the option of repairing remote items and remotely stripping a ships fittingthis would fix the problem things that are really damaged could be repaired and if the damaged part is not really damaged but just used like mining crystals you should at least be able to remove all fittings remotely which would automatically include the damaged parts
might as well support my own idea
hi i think that it should be possible to put your own music in the jukebox that way people who want to listen to the standard eve music can do that and people who want to listen to their own music will start using the jukeboxe
i believe its not allowed due to legal reason its been suggested quite a few times over the years
idk about the legal stuff but some games actually allow you to set a folder and all mp3s from that folder are played if i remember correctly i saw that in spore too
legal reasons hmm i assume that this has to do with music which is copyrighted being put into the jukebox but you could put in music that dosnt have copyright
prob something to do with the server being the one dishing out the music
there is no way the server dishes out the music it would be rank insanity to make a player stream a small selection of music instead of downloading it with the client if eve included pandora then streaming music might make sense but not for a limited list
theres a reoccurring glitch where you jump into a mission area and the music stops hangswhateverhence my reasoningbut yes you do have a valid point there
definitely supported
i support this great idea
as a trader myself i would love this idea
previous thread on ammunition swappingill be surprised that this hasnt been suggested but wouldnt an easy lag solution be to make all guns clipless make it so that you have an ammo bay on each ship that can take a certain m3 of whatever type roundsmake all of the guns load directly from this ammo bay such that the firing rate is continuous as with an amarr ships currently dpses may need to be rebalanced based on the type of ammunition1 we eliminate the a lot of the server load from reloading and tracking the current clip of 68 guns we replace it with one ammo bay object furthermore this is the type of behavior that can be predicted rof  number of guns  time  rounds spent allowing for further server side optimization in high load situations you dont have to check as often to see if the ships guns still have something to fireare firing you check once on activation deactivation type change and at a time when we have calculated that you should be getting lowalthough you will still track 1 or 2 ammunition types this is hardly different from tracking the ammunition in a cargo hold we will essentially reduce the algorithmic level of complexity exponentially as we are no longer really worrying about moving around small ammunition objects every so often and tracking 8 different objects we are now tracking 1 or two ammunition attributes within the ammunition bay object 2 we reduce the currently huge advantage that amarr ships have in lagged fleet battles no reloading  no reloading lag  insanely higher dps 10 to literally infinite higher dps depending on amount of lag there is a reason 15 revs died in m0 the other day bob knows what they are doing and the rev is far and away the best dreadamarr ships still have the advantage of not having to manage ammunitionammunition bay and will still be excellent choices for fleet battles just not the only choice as they are now3 we can have the desired effect of instantaneously switching ammunition types this results in a number of interesting situations where there may be a tactical advantage to switching ammunition types youll note two things here first is that we are not dealing with clips anymore we no longer have to move objects during battle at all instead we decrement a counter changing ammunition is now a matter of changing a pointer object rather than moving 8 objects a pointer change should be a comparatively free operation
tbh i think we should just all agree to use smartbombs no amoo issues no reloading no drone lag local numbers would plummet due to lack of pods being around blobs would melt under their own weight and the geddon and phoon would probably be the only two battleships worth flying
i wasnt too keen on this when i first read the titel but by the time id got through the text it does seems to make sense and be a workable solution it also solves another issue i have where if you dont have enough ammo to fully reload the entire bank of guns there is no way other than manually splitting stacks to split your remaining ammo between them to maintain your dpsonly thing that concerns me is you mention rebalancing of dps  have to say it is rare that i run out of ammo have to reload and keep firing generally i reload as i go and select moments in the battle where the 10 second reload does not interfere with my shooting
ive never written code for an online game so im not really sure how much of an effect this would truly have you used the word exponentially how about more concrete answers fancy words dont mean mucha removal of an advantage for a specific weapon type as a counter to lag is something i simply cannot agree on without giving something to compensatealso removes the consequences of not being properly prepared or making a poor decisioni think time spent improving performance as well as upgrading server architecture to better handle the load is a better alternative
exponentially most certainly does have a concrete meaning i would suggest you look it up instead of criticizing people for your own ignorance
exponentially is hardly a fancy wordif n is the number of gunswell for each reload you have n ammunition objects being moved into n number of guns and an object update to the cargo bay you also have n counters being decremented by 1 for each gun for each shot n objects being altered for each gun for each volley this is of cubic exponential complexity n squared  reload  n squared  volleymax 64 operations reloads  64 operations  volleysin the proposed system there are three possibilities1 1 counter that decrements the ammunition in the bay once for each shotn  volley second order complexitymax 8 operations  volleys2 1 counter that decrements the ammunition in the bay once for each volleyvolleys linear complexitymax operations 1  volleys3 the predictive approach do two calculations on gun activation we calculate how long the ship can fire its guns with its current ammunition if we reach this point we deactivate the guns on gun deactivation manual or otherwise we do an update to the database about how many rounds are left using our previous equation gunsrofduration client display of ammunition is tracked by the individual client if we are firing for a particularly long time and there is a possibility of desynch we do run our rofduration calc occasionally to make sure everyone is up to datethis is of a constant complexity 2 in particularly long firing sessions this will be of a duration 2 additionalchecks in most cases firing a few volleys then reloading it will be complexity 2 i agree completely however amar currently outclass other races by so much in certain situations that it is foolish not to fly their ship type better to bring a t1 amarr bs than a t2 of other races much of the time this is entirely because of their advantage of not having to reload all of the time they would actually maintain their stated benefit of not using ammunition that is true my point was more in response to wranglers quote that they do not want people reloadingchanging ammo all of the time because of the lag issues involved we can certainly maintain a penalty for switching from one ammunition type to the other i was merely stating that the penalty would no longer be mandatory
zomg i have never thought of this
interesting idea i dont think itll reduce lag at all since reloading is so much rarer an operation than firing but it does have a few other benefits most notably you dont lose dps when you have 3 guns worth of ammo left for 8 guns and you have to f1f8 less often youd have to drop the rof of ammousing weapons a little bit to compensate for this which the pvpers wont like but the difference would be small also your math seems flawed  where do you get the on2 from each firing of n guns decrements n ammo counters and does n damage calculations and each reload decrements the ammo stack in your hold n times and increments n ammo counters both of those operations are on meaning that theres not room for more than constant improvement
no having the clip and force activation of guns makes each type of weapon unique they would have to redo every weapon system again if they were o go all clipless as well as balance cargo space
rotflmaoepic failgoogle mathematics and the key word exponentsas for the idea dont think that would fix lag as so much even if it did it would be rather smallish in effectvalid points however as far as the programing aspect goesbut i dont think it would effect much of a changebut i do like the idea of ammo bay as opposed to clipsstoring the ammo in a separate cargo slot much like a drone bay would prevent me from accidentally yanking my ammo out
i never really understood the intelligence behind the ammo clip these ships would have the local ammo storage by the gun in order to keep a steady stable feed of ammunition however the ship would also have a system to keep ammunition moving between the ships ammunition magazine and the individual gun magazinesfor those who claim the amarr will loose their no reload advantage think of this you still are not paying for your ammunitionthe only thing not mentioned is ammunition swapping as long as the ships magazine can hold multiple types of charges and it still takes 10 seconds to change what type of round you are using i support this idea
i think that they should make an exception for lvthey can enforce the age limit on subsequent candidates but i think it would be a good idea to reduce it to 18 unless icelandic law requires them to make the age limit 21b
support
all for it  a small clause to be added that instead of just the 21 year age limit to be a valid candidate that it becomes the 21 year age limit to be a valid candidate unless the candidate has held a position on the csm previously
signedi regret my vote for other unnamed candidate but i have been impressed with lavista let him run
its also about maturity so id say 21 is also ok as some countrys have limited rights from 18 to 21
18 over 21
grandfather lavista inhis maturity and professional demeanor exceed his actual age by a long shot if a limit for future candidates must be set 18 seems to make more sense than 21
yarrr thumbs up
i think npc tax should reflect the risk reward model of eve to me it has more to do with that than anything else while i think it is a good idea to encourage players to join player corps people shouldnt be forced this is a sandbox game there should be a choice but it should be a choice which both sides have benifits on paper not just because a corp is potentially awesome on the same token playing in an npc corp restricts you from the bad things of eve such as wardecs while you can still be suicide ganked or ganked in lowsec or 00 you carry significantly less risk with you i think you should pay for that risk the 2 things i would do 1 non pvp related npc corps are taxed 102 broker fees for players in npc corps are reduced 25 on top of skills3 npc refining tax is reduced 025 on top of skillsstandingsbut at the same time i would introduce personal hangers which benifits all eve players giving us more organizational options whatever the solution it needs to be more carrot than stick keep in mind that an npc corp tax on rat bounties will not affect real newbies real newbies when they just join the game will be unable to kill the rats that draw such bounties  in a corpalliance which does not openly recruit so that you cant recruit card you guys keep playing is meaningless to me
i would be fine with this if it means npc corp players can set up pos and get corp hangar style hangars only accessible for themtldr no
not all highsec corps care about setting up poss individual players for the most part do not care about setting up poss
it seems to me that the idea of moving players out of noob npc corps is a good idea given that the player is ready and they are not forcedbut for me there is a major problemmembers of the dev team see the current war dec system as a problem its flawed not fatally but dont put the crash cart away just yet  and will be fixed sooner rather than lateras far as im aware no member of the dev team has sen the current npc corp situation as a problem im willing to be corrected here plzso by encouraging players out of npc corps now seems like putting the cart before the horsesee what the new system will achieve whenif it arrives and then after its been around and its effects felt if there is still a need to encourage people to leave npc corps by all means do itfrankly the war dec system is a bigger problem currently than the npc corps and changing the staus quo now leads to the very real prospect of having to change all over again when the new war dec system comes inedit also hopefully the up and coming midas expansion will also have plenty of extra advantages for players to join player corps midas will be an excellent opportunity bring in systems to benefit joint industrial efforts centered around player corps but that might just be wishfull thinking
well i guess its the point of view you see it like a punishement but imho its far from that actually for me its a bonus reward for not participating in any multiplayer content that is availiable this is not about punishment this is about fairness npc corps are an exception and not standard there is no reason why they shouldnt pay taxes as everybody elseyour benefits 14 have nothin to do with player corps i play solo as well as i have a hard time finding the right corpally but i have no problems at all to find players in local help channel or whereever to do missioning together escort or whatever its called fleet you dont need a player corp for all those things
the message i get from your reply is avoid this guy corp as evidently the ceodirectors keep all the tax for themselves and give nothing in return to the players evidently you are getting nothing for your taxes so you feel that other players should suffer with you benefits 14 have all to do with players corps as most of those things dont work or are more difficult to set up than when players are in npc corpyour fleet cant help you someone steal your wreckcan and you want to retaliate dont has aggro on the attacker if someone attack you and so on i suggest you learn how the aggro rules work before commenting not having learned them in six months of play is dangerousedit spelling
oh come on making people pay for something they already had isnt punishment so you reward people by making then pay for something they have always had how nice  and well ignore the hypocrisy of your following statementyes you have just said youll reward everyone in an npc corp for the bonus reward of not participating in multiplayer content even though they probably aremy only problem with your proposal i listed abovebut saying black is white and expecting us to be dumb enough to believe it i do have a problem withhave the decency to call what you want done what it is

that is just it i dont see how most alliances could maintain for a prolonged period of time an active presence in fw and defending their 00 space you have not convinced me that alliances in militia forces will break fw any more than alliances targeting fw fighters sf is the big example from outsidei have a slight deviation from the topic and one to ask uk em and other alliances like them  if given a middle option  megacorporationconglermateetc that could not hold 00 space in its own name but it could join a factionalliance and then have the benefits of being in an alliance would you reform into that an inbetween
this i can agree with as it doesnt allow for accounts to autotrain while the user doesnt pay for the account either this or the autotraining doesnt occur when the account is disabledby that logic all ore should automatically transfer to your hauler and missions should run themselves without you having to press a button sorry this doesnt make a shred of sense
the logic is a bit sketchy ill agree but its not as bad as you suggest id draw a distinction between playing the gamemining missioning etc and doing support activitiessetting skills looking up item prices etc  the former are things the player has to do themselves the latter should be automated as much as possible this is what i was trying to get at with the frustration is needless but i didnt really make my point very well
its about time ccp implements this its been wayyy to long
i agree there needs to be a 1 skill queue but the op is placing blame for individual choice on ccp those that downloaded that program did so at their own risk and are responsible for their action im not a big fan of ccps customer relations about 3 on a scale of 10 imo but blaming anyone else for the stupidity of those that tried that program is ridiculous

adding one reply packet to the end of the initial gridloading data stream ypu are forgetting a little point from each ship each ship need to acknowledge that you have been loaded or you will be invisible for some of them when you start firing but at that time your single packet can be some hundred confirmations all subject to lag and packet loss and it will require to be redone every time a new ship load care to guess how long it will take i think several hours
no thats not the right way to implement it at all1 your client sends a packet or set of packets at the end of a grid load this confirms that you indeed have objects and other players loaded and in place on your grid the objects and players that the server sent ie hey im rendering stuff time to start the shootyshooty 2 the server logs the data and activates hostilities between yourself and other players3 profit we arent looking for a perfect system where we make sure everyone is rendering everyone we are looking for an imperfect system where we can determine this person was rendering something and sending instructions or what was this person rendering at time of death and could he send instructions logs themselves could even be sent to a completely different log server making any point about increased load moot from that perspectiveyou also have to remember that the server is most likely already sending and receiving lots and lots and lots of packets every second in such a situation maybe you wouldnt have to do this type of checking in highsec but in lowsec or 00 these appear to me to be a particularly important few packets that arent being dealt with this is more about proper implementation and design than which side lost what tbh if this happens to bob they should be reimbursed too it is a suckyfrustrating way to lose ships i see it as a design flaw that this could happen rather than some sort of red vs blue issue
morsus mihi loses a fleet fight and spams the forums and demands their ships back god you guys look like huge whinersthe problem is not the reimbursement the problem is that you are dying while staring at a black screen if your enemy spent the fuelstrontium and ammo and killed a blackscreened guy instead of someone who loaded then that they should get an insta kill button as reimbursement as well your idea is just terribleyou should not be loaded and ongrid and shootable unless your client has loaded the screen im no programmer but i dont see why something cannot be worked outbig yes to fixing dying to a black screenbig no to being pompous because your alliance died to a lag fight do you think this is the first time someone lost a ship due to lag
as much as we the playerbase like to inundate these forums with remove the lag posts ccp has been taking steps to sort the lag problem the desync problem is seperate all i am asking is that while they put us through alpha and beta tests on their new systems that they take accountability for their nonperformance this is not a question of bob the northern coalition or anyone else for that matter nor do i presume to be in the first fleet to lose a battle to lag this does not invalidate the point that the reimbursement policy when such nonperformance does occur is poorly designed this is not conspiratorial were not alleging any underhandedness in the matter this is not partisan this isnt about spiting one alliance or another this is simply saying telling people that their time is simply not worth even investigation or what essentially appears to be a macro response letter much less fairly compensating a customer for a products nonperformance is a policy that should be changed as for the whiner comment i suggest you peruse the killboards from that battle for my loss im whining about or more specifically the lack thereof
qftft youre pretty handy with the hammer there mate two thumbs freshops got my support
as you have blocked the rendering of your ship to the other machines you will start firing from invisible and invulnerable very kewl for you a lot less for your targets dont seem an improvement
ofc i am ready to lose the ship i am flying but that is a stupid argument so just cuz i am ready to loose it i should sacrifice it just because i can i want to keep it as long as possible so that i loose it cuz a server problem and have no chance to fight back or even activate my modules just sucks
would love to see this
yarr
rigs are on killmails why not implants 
to put it in an examplethere are 100 gtcs on the market and 120 buyers if the gtcs fixed price is 450m sellers seeing the demand will smartly post trading threads asking for morehow do you think they will get more isk for their gtc getting around the gtc maximum well thats easy they have you transfer the difference to them in game before they give you the trade offer through the secure system problem with this well this opens quite a few holes for scammers to scam gtc sales something the secure system was created to prevent a gtc cap is stupid for obvious reasons
get a job irl this is the typical solution for most adults u can earn the measily 15 with 1 or 2 hours of labor in real life with any basic paying job this is not something ccp should be wasting their time focused on ccp doesnt make any money from you spending isk in game to buy the card they sell the cards at a fixed price its just an option out there for people making huge amounts of isk per day that can easily support this transaction if your not up to par with what you make in game real life money god forbid can solve this rather easilyccp is trying to get the game to the point where its 90 player controlled economy if they intervene with this its going against their end ideas of being hands off the market price will go back down if the majority consider the price above its true value economics class would explain this better than i
bringing back 30  90 day cards fine but absolutely no to ccp regulation of the ingame value of gtcs
yeah that aspect of the ui borders on comical i have to move the camera so the buttons are over empty space just to tell if modules are inactive or not i cant believe the game has been out for five years like that seems like an easy fix but who knows
as being partial color blind myself i fully support this
i agree plus add the bug factorand one more thing this is a game when you can mine and run missions in peace and where you can blast someone after a long hard day at work or enjoy beeing blasted for the masochistic type of personality the game itself is complicated enough to serve this purpose dont make it more complicated
i dont judge ideas based on the programming effort or bug fixing difficulty im sure ccp knows how to handle those and wouldnt take on what they couldnt do now i believe this idea has exactly 0 support from other players of this game so howabout we just let it go back to page 2 where you found it and im sure it will eventually make its way to the bottom thx
im completely against it because it only has significant drawbacks and no significant advantagethe number of people who would suffer from it would be multiple times the number of people who could possibly enjoy itthe effort to implement it would be huge and it would take massive resources away from much more interesting projectsit will scare of new players even moreand last but not least it is very likely already in the game seriously what do you think isk really is it is an exchange currency there are hundreds of planets in eve and big political blocks that rarely agree much with each other i think it is very likely that many worlds have their own local currencies you only dont see them in game because it would just mess everything upgreat work with the mission here you got 500000 aunianian flongsuhm what can i do with thosejust take a shuttle down to aunia you can spend them there in hotels bars holocinemas bu shoes candy liquor or you can convert them for a fee and at a rate of 316927 into sinq unitUFFFDs those can be traded for isk at a rate ofi hate youby the way it is a freakish assumption that isk would be standard in 00 while the empires would massively deviate the other way around is much more likely compare europe with africa europe has the euro africa has lots of stuff it is not the more or less chaotic small dominions that create unified currency it is the powerblocks so even if something like this was implemented it would be the empire space that would use isk and the 00 factions who would give out their own currency hello bobdollar goonswarm rupees red rubels gurista pesos
you say that because you dont understand whats involved in programming such thingsits not as simple as a web page you need to keep in mind that with the current system nowwith all of its bugs you now have to impliment 4 additional currencies track there values track the markets for each currenciestrack the exchange rates track the ammounts of transactionshandle any disputeshandle any possible logging loadsif you can come up with a basis for tracking all of the above without telling me ccp can figure it out be my guestill warn you i have experience in database systems its never as simple as it looksyes your idea is quite grandiose and clever but we have major issues that need working out we should focus on fixing what we got first as opposed to adding a whole new 3 to 4 separate sets of economiesin all honesty i think its obvious as to why each empire has an unified currency systemits to keep it simplehard enough to track an entire universe with multiple currenciesnow if ccp already had an prototype for such a system no problem thenbut right now i doubt itgood idea but not likely to be something in the near future

what do you see the intended role of a command ship nighthawk in particular is in pvp are you looking for an upgraded hac because they should not be upgraded hacs command ships have a different role from hacs maybe the command ship shouldnt be trying to tackle not every ship needs to do that
tackle and tank night hawk
i see the role of the field cs as being gang mod and dps support platforms as opposed to the fleet commands which are purely there for the gang mod also they must have bslevel tanks being a valuable gang asset the shield tanker field cs fit the gang mod and dps role strictly the armour tankers have extra flexibility being able to fit tackle or ewar as they so choosecurrently however there are problems the nighthawk is unable to fit a gang mod on a pvp setup because of hopelessly inadequate pg it cannot be tanked particularly well  the active tank is awful the buffer tank is not much better than that of a comparablyfit drake this is partially a result of limited midslots and rigslots you could either give the nh and presumably sleip an extra midslot to help their tank but another tank bonus or simply extra shield hp and cap would also be usefulelsewhere the astarte meets problems by having to drop a gun to fit a gang mod  this may or may not be balanced as far as the ship is concerned but it confuses people and dissuades them from using the ship as intended another problem is activetanking itself  its broken in pvp buffer tanks and rr are superior in most circumstances so the sleip and astarte really get the short end of the stick change these to resisthp bonuses or fix active tanking by significantly increasing the overheat bonus on reppersboosters enabling an active tank to survive longer under focus fireoverall either the field commands should have the fittings to fit their gang mods without any problems or more sensibly they should have bonuses towards the fittings of the gang mod they also need more tank theres nothing wrong with the nhs dps potential and it certainly doesnt need an extra launcher  the problem atm is that you cant fit the 3 bcs that you should be fitting because of crippling pg problemsreally the entire class needs to be brought up to date
so you are saying that shield tanking commandships are a causality of the perceived tactical necessity to fit a mwd or at least the nighthawk isdo you think if some of the previously mentioned speed changes devblog that were added to sisi were instituted on tranq there would be a need to overall 8 ships
well the need to fit a mwd does hurt the shield tank but since the mwd is the most powerful tank mod that you can fit i dont have a problem with that the sleip can have a very nice xlsb active tank  but its horribly vulnerable to cap warfare the nh can barely fit a msb giving them another midslot may cause problems with excessive combat flexibility t2 ham drake not good for game balance i think so tweaking shield hp and cap size may be betteri expect mwds to still be essential on large ships abs will be a specialist mod used pretty much only on frigateclass ships and mwds will often be preferred there anyway  it wont change anything for the nhsleips midslotspg problems
all caldari ships have less pg than their counterparts because they need less pg to fit their tankslse  150 pg iirc800mm plate  200 pgwith shield boosters the difference become even more apparentx large shield booster  500 pglarge armour repper  2000 pg
passwords are not personal information indeed they should never be even close to personal informationpasswords are almost always kept as oneway hashes and a good hash algorithm ensures that the likelihood of finding the password from the hash is low and that the chance of your password and someone elses computing to the same hash is small sha1 a popular hash algorithm has been shown to be weaker in collisions than it was supposed to be but there are plenty of longer hashes out there this sets aside that collisions are not as relevant for password hashing their importance is in digital signing that said keeping the current hashes secure is important but only from the perspective of your individual account you could in theory replay the hash in some way if you had access to it but thats got nothing to do with previous ones being storedchanging passwords often is a good practice however its hard to do utilities like keepass are ideal because they require you to remember only one hardtoguess password and keep your actual account passwords encrypted until you request them my eve password is more than 15 alphanumerical random characters and i change it every few months i dont need to remember it though i need to remember the decryption password for the utility database there is of course an overhead in this i have to have the keepass program handy to decrypt the password but given that its a few hundred kilobytes it fits easily on a usb stick oh and obviously i back it up lotsany methods that will obtain your keepass password would obtain your account passwords anyway keyloggers for example so the security risk in using such utilities is small to none provided the utility itself is reasonably secure security is never 100 secure but you can make life difficult enough for an attacker that they go somewhere elseregardless storage of previous password hashes is not a serious security risk

youll never completely eliminate lag not at our current technology levelthe reason you see less of it in other games is they are not nearly as dynamic as eve they have far less computations going on in any given combat the only way you could eliminate lag given current tech constraints would be to dumb down the game so badly that no one would want to play it anymore swg comes to mind
the only way to have eve completely lagless would be making it turn based
absolutely fallout 2 let you do it wheres the opportunity for good and evil i say

if maturity is what they are worried about then they should do interviews or something i have seen many people over 21 that are immature and people under 21 who act maturethe 21 rule is bull
as someone who takes part in the nullsec pos warfare putting someones towers into reinforced does not kill them you still have time to defend them and regroup the amount of time the pos is in reinforced also making strontium timing a important mechanic yes a smaller alliance might have to become pets for a while until they get strong enough to defend a part of space of which there is still a lot unclaimed but i see the current system as viable and working
limiting the population size of an alliance wont workjust because your game mechanics caps the limit doesnt mean there arent any unspoken alliances in game that could easily be achievedbut i do think there should be some bonuses give to the smaller guysmuch like a graduated taxable income the bigger you are the more you pay or have to compensate forotherwise these giants will never ever be challenged or stoppablethat makes it boring and theres little challenge let alone incentive to bother showing up or tryingshort of joining them which compounds the problemdont get me wrong im not saying that alliances the size of  those who have more than a thousand members or others is badi think its kinda awesome they could amass such a populationbut they should have fewer advantages due to sheer size of population as a result of that factthere numbers alone could make up for the bonuses smaller alliances getjust means they have to work harder which would be minuscule in comparison to the bulk of the corps out there who dont have that kind of benefitin short yeah bigger alliances are awesome but they need to grant a bit of a handicap to the smaller folk so its not so easy to pull a blitzkrieg on themnever mind the sheer firepower the population alone would compensate for the shortfallthats how these big giant alliances thrive massive numbers to draw on pretty much take care of any big problemsstagnant empires of little to no change make for a dull gamekeep it fresh mix it up a bit
well renewable sources would be good if they provided enough energy and selling any excess to the national gridhowever the initial cost may be higher than the actual income where expenses with this idea would surely go past unless ccp are in a lot of profit enough which to cover monthly costs unforeseeables and so forth then its doubtful energy suppliers might feed them the power from what they could claim to be coming from renewable sources but that wouldnt be certain as the power lines arent exactly changing themselves to source from a different part anyway it wouldnt be business ethical if costs are in excess of current strategy
youre right that the actual power can come from just about anywhere but the important part is that your money goes to the people producing green energy electricity is fungible its who gets paid for it that matters somebody else actually understands that
not sure if the issue was eventually brought up or not but i agree this would bring rsd on the same level as ecm for those specialized ships or at least give a larger bonus to the ships that are meant for rsd
you forgot that they also nerfed damp rigs made my rapier cryi do not fly arazulachscelestisetc but i support an increase to their bonus for rsds
agree 100 on this one
agreed damps were overpowered and overused but the gallante ew ships were pretty much fine at a bare minumum the arazu lachesis and keres should get an extra 575 damp strength per level taking them to 10 or 125 celestis should be 25 loweradditionally add ew falloff rigsedit also change signal distortion amps to boost all ew types not just ecm
damps suck and need a boostecm got nerfed damp style before but ecm spec ships got a big boost
signed arazulachesis are pricey boats for being basically crap compared to other recons command ship can make interceptor into mini arazulachesis in sense of warp disruption at range that is fail when you are pushed in that direction because of the cost of boats that are made to do it and just dont well enough to be worth it
i would take this one step further though poss should not countrol systems planets and colonies should if you want to contest sov in a system you have to siege planets which halts production and gives the attacker anything left on the planet and in the orbiting array also no reinforcement timers i have no idea what ccp were thinking when they decided to exclude planets from any particular use and then include pos warfare i cant believe this wasnt in the game from the beginning

having to log in to change a skill dose not encourages players to log into the game and play it is an inconvenience and make some player base not want to play because they want to play when they have the time to play simple as that i support rapid implementation and deployment of a skill query system long over due fix lag wile your at it
i approve of this idea not just for potential reduction in lag but also because it could be used to add more to ship management different sized ammo bays rigs to increase the size modules like expanded cargo holds to increase the size etc
well when you put it like that it has meriti support this as long as the change can be made and not unbalance everything
less lag  less guessingifmygunsarestillfiringoriftheyranoutofammo5minutesago  i rykee
while i know what exponential mean i dont get why you thing the increase in calculations from 1 to n guns should be exponential and not linear a single guns operation s have no effect on the other guns in eve you dont fire a volley as a single command were all the guns are involved you fire n single guns so to me the increase in complexity seem linear your idea still reduce the number of operations but will force the system to check if you have a number of ammunitions not divisible for the numbers of your guns but ina linear fashionthen there are hazy area what will it do if you are using different ammunitions in different guns and if you are using different gunslaunchersas written it seem geared only for a single kind of gun standardized for all the hardpoints of a ship
the implementation of this rule has been postponed so it seems like we made ccp change their mindhurray
the rule has been postponed or you have been grandfathered in cause if it has been postponed my 13yr old cousin wants to try and run for csmp
how do we grandfather him when hes under 21 wouldnt that be physically impossibleseriously lavistavista has complied with every ccp requirement and has proven to be a strong advocate for industrial improvements we should be free to elect who we feel is best qualified and i support lavistavista
supported
outside of america you can legally drink without being 21 so that shouldnt be an issue its not something you will get a ticket for when you get back to the border psupported never heard of him and not an industry person but if he is good at what he does and has the general player vote i say allow him to run for office againme hopes ccp doesnt say ok just to quiet the crowd and then rig vote so he loses 
i suppose warping while cloaked and jamming at 200km isnt enough for ya also you dont want anything to be able to counter your precious little ship effectively
i cant even fly a blackbird effectively never mind a falcon i just happen to think that eccm is fine  you use two slots and turn the falcon from jamming 2 ships to jamming 23 of a ship assuming he doesnt clue in and splits his jammers youre essentially in the clear and you can always overheat if youre having real trouble now find me two slots that will counter a hac to that level of effectiveness
again its not the fact that falcons can permajam 3 bss or that eccm doesnt work or anything like that the problem is that the falcon can operate at silly distancesyou can deal with a rapier curse arazu and all the other recons without having to field a ship specifically fitted to counter them you cant do that with a falcon mostly because its too far away i suggest that the falcons max operating range is put in line with the other recons the ship should lose its jamming capability at 40km you know it makes sense p
yesterday i fiddled with an oneiros setup and racial jammers even with pdasda you could get half the jamming ability of a falconits quite apparent that falcons always should be primaried
wtf you do realize that every t2 caldari cruiser is very capable of operating at 50 km  100 km including the basilisk 3 out of 4 of the caldari t1 cruisers have similar operating ranges the osprey being the only one not able to do so in its combat roleno the falcon  rook are very different from the other recons do not have the punch or close range tools of other reconscan i agree to modifying the falcons bonuses again yes where you are seeing a falcon i think a rook is the intended ship for itduh  the falcon blackbird  rook are designed to use jammers the oneiros is designed to use remote armor repairers  targeting links you are going to get less jamming ability of a griffin
still dont see why this is a problem for you it takes a whole enemy ship  specifically fitted to target you  to reduce you to 50 effectiveness discounting drones sounds like those eccms are working pretty damb well to me id be tearing my hear out if i was that falcon pilot and only getting 1 jam every other cycle on you talk about frustrating
no op is right theres nuthin reasonable why npc corps should be free of tax i would even go further and lay taxes on market sales as well not only for npc npc corps are a pain in the ass every time i stumble upon suicide gankers they are in npc corp scout alts  npc corps macro miners  npc corps high sec xtreme mission farmersalts  npc corpssomething should be done and introducing a tax rate would give an incentive to players to decide what they wanna do risk vs reward that simple
i agree with this one
this proposal to tax npc corp members seems like it will be making the game less fun for a large number of players becausea it will be taking away resource isk from players who might actually like the community of an npc corp but not especially like smaller corp lifeb it wont be adding anything of benefit for themc they can game the system by starting a 1 man corp as others in this thread have pointed outplease fix the wardec problem some other way mandatory military service for a week every month for npc corp players with over x million sp or y months membership ie they can be attacked if the npc corp is war decced
you are assuming much for your information i dont farm if i find the time to play 5 hour a week im lucky thats probably the biggest reason why iam in a npc corp right now and no not every player corporation is charging taxes as for the rent i dont know how much they pay exactly you have any official number do they really pay a rent again you are assuming a lot of thing without any facts
really you have all the data and research that proves this statement or you just generalizing and making blank statements because you are in a game that does not suit you
that right there is the service the tax is paying for
please tell me where you are located any if you have any fittings of value anyone who will just gang with random people almost deserves to get piratedscammed
supported my phoenix will cry but supported anyhow p
you get the shiver me timbers capital whaling harpoon launcher i
i think bombs would be absolutely fine the way they are if they changed one small thing the fact that a bomb does not hit targets that entered the grid after they were launched when a bomb detonates it should hit everything in its range like a smartbomb detonation not just the ones that have been there for the past 15 seconds this way with the right timing the bomb becomes a very effective antiblob tool keep the price where its at and maybe increase the damage but first change the detonation mechanic
i believe dual training was already presented by csm to ccp
i support a look at artillery in general or the tempest specificallyartillery has long been the lower dps lower range lower tracking but higher burst damage choice this is a fine role however changes to base hp rigs and scripts have increased the rangetracking gap while reducing the effective burst damage as a fraction of the targets total hp others have noted how the hp increases and introduction of rigs affects artillerys burst damage artillery are now worse compared to other long range turrets than they were even though the stats have not changed due to changes in mods ships and rigs artillery should still be low dps low range low tracking and high burst but the disadvantages need to be reduced and the advantages increased to bring artillery back into line relative to the other long range turrets
i love alpha strike on artiesi support this idea
artillery could defibatly use a look at
signed these guns are harder then hell to fit with a decent set up and all other platforms out range them and out dps them alpha strike damage imo is not a plus at all in any capacity increase dps and range of the weapons and most of all balance there power grid its way out in left filed
on a side note the circular caldari stations have a terrible docking range to balance the huge docking range of the high sec caldari stationssee 15w
the sooner the elcetions come the better maybe then we can elect some pilots who will represent the opinions needs and desires of the player base instead of abusing the position for thier own ends star fraction and thier fw farseofc the only way we will acieve this is if we secure a high player turnout during the voting process so that people are not carried into the position on the backs of votes from thier alliances
with the display of futility and the disorganized ineptitude of the last csm fewer people are going to vote for the next one itll be a farce where a small vocal minority will get influence far exceeding its significanceccp should set a minimum required voter turnout and declare the csm project dead if fewer people than this minimum go voting
maybe you should run miz and show us the benefits of all that skill training knowledge on a serious note though not exactly sure what you think has been an abuse of spending time in the csm to get fw sorted out properly and pushing improvement issues  but im sure youre going to tell us ps this thread should be in jita park rather than assembly hall
so the csm is biased because it wants to improve prenerfed thingsfw is one of them black ops is another exampleyou can say a lot about jade and the issues he has raisedi quite like most of them though i dont agree with everything but obvious troll is obviousas for the speculation about the turnout of the next csm lets wait and see due november shall we im not saying that i disagree but speculation is absolutely pointless
yes i havnt played for 2 years but i do still pay for those accounts i pay for them in the hope that eve will evolve into something i enjoy spending time with againthis seems unlikley to happen though when the wishes of the player base are represented by a corrupt few with no desire to do anything other than promote thierf own causeshave you forgotten already the outrage that was vented on the forums when u defended a corps right to war dec a corp within the militia i suppose that had nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that that was exactley what your corp was doing at the timeincase you havnt noticed the csm is seen as a joke by the vast majority of the player base and come november a good voter turnout permiting the joke will end
is it just me or have the csm delegate labels been removed
its a bug they found out that the tag had some nonintended sideeffect so it has to be patched before it will be put back on
so what is your platform hic removal so you can again smartbomb rancer with a capital ship and play againseeing as you have been a expert scammer i sincerely doubt you will think of the general game well being and not your personal interests
miz holy  i was just talking about you and the other degenerates just the other day dr sliceginger tiller and the the other notables we were talking about how much we miss the old scallywags i would love to see a pirate like your self in the csm it would give a nice twist to things but time will tell as far as the csm i think this is all going to be a wait and see kind of thing if it is going to fail it will be probably the second or third election so the csm has a bit of time to make things work and you are right majority of the population has no idea what is going on in the csm nor really cares and you can not force players to care or participate in itoh and by the way the nyx on the hek gate was very well played much tears flowed and local convos were great
i recently logged a formal complaint against a gms for a reaon i cannot disclosepoint of raising a issue is thusim told by the senior gm in this matter that even though he will mail the leads i will not get to knowa any acknowledment of the receipt of the complaintbany points that are upheld or overturnedi dont need to know the outcome but surely anybody putting in a grievance needs to have assurances that its heard or even actioned to a certain extentthis needs to be addressed as complaints made has a requirement in any other industry of the issuer of the complaint to be kept informed or even updatedi feel that my complaint will not be heard nor will it see the light of daysurely if customer service is important to ccp the person raising the complaint will need to feel the complaint is being heard and even taken seriously
supply has gone down demand has remained the samethe price went up i wonder whyprolly because it costs 33 more for 33 less game time on gtcs imo the whole system is defunct and will collapse and ccp will see their mistake then
yes because there will never in the future be timerich cashpoor students looking to play their favourite game for free
sighthumbs down

random chatting wartargets is real ed of me so i do it all the time
if i had 1 isk for every time someone convos me and then says nothing or insists that i convod them when i know i didnt because i had the accept convo dialog due to this feature then id be a very rich man
yay for colour blind people
even though im not colorblind i feel for you op this has probably just been an oversight from ccps part but it definitely needs addressing
red green colour blind here
this is the answer to this thread
i thought about this some more and i think there is a way to include currencies without messing up the systemisk is a digital currency there is no sense in any other interstellar digital transaction currencies however depending on ccps view on the subject and the background there could still be hard cash currencies for local market usesuch hard cash currency could just be included as a trade good and that trade good could be fitted with a price fluctuationthe money itself could be looted from npc wrecks and the market mechanisms would be pretty fit to handle such stuff it would easily handle the demand issue too if you found eg serpentis dollars you could only spend them in serpentis territory so only serpentis stations would buy the stuff doing so converts it back into isk which you could then use as knownit would not be the true currency exchange system suggested by the op but it would be a working workaround
sigh  im getting really miffed about these mwaa i cant be as good as the old players  threads  mate just suck it up and do what we had to do learn the fkn skillz no im not a bought account ive been playing since 2003 if ya dont like it then find another game  sorry but thats how i feel in a nutshell if you want to suceed then persevere dont ask for it to be handed to you on a plate if you stick with it as i have done the eventually you to will be able to fly every ship buying every ship is another matter though 0so basically stick withit an stop fkn moaning
submitting these issues to the agenda
issue corporation market order modificationissue invention implant needs fixingissue test server skill speed increaseidea advanced infomorph psychology
okay the agenda is set
a pos module that keeps ships from cloaking in the entire system sov 3 required we already have a cyno jammer pos module why not this as well for added security in a system
added security should be up to the players them selves removing a part of game play that promotes small gang warfare which we need badly is bad we want more small gang warfare no matter if they are cloakers are not is what a lot of players are screaming fornow if this is because afk cloakers are messing with your head then it is working as intended its another form of warfare
pretty self explanatory the ability to place up to 4 sentry guns on gates and stations in a system that you have either sov 3 or 4 in make them have some kind of draw back so that they dont end up all over the place
as you should probalble alreayd start youre csm campaing i want to ask you about what you think of small gang pvp and its future with the nano nerf how do you think about the survival of this type of pvp i life of small scale pvp and roaming and  but now the with the upcoming nano nerf it might actually really die in 00 now i dont mean small scale pvp within 5 jump radius i mean roamingas alliances get bigger and bigger with more and more advanced jump bridge networks how do you think we are able to do wo nanos or are you just supporting blob yourself too approach as many do i want to hear what you think about this future i have 2 votes to give and the one who has the best ideas and dedication to support my style of gameplay disscus
given that applications for the csm dont close for another week and itll probably be a week after that until the list of candidates goes live i dont think many people are going to start campaigning until the middle of the month theres only one candidate who has announced as of now and you have until november 21 to vote so theres no hurry on that either your question is a good one though a little bit wideranging for me to answer right nowi have to go out in half an hour but if you want it to be a topic of debate for csm candidates wait 23 weeks until the race is actually on and ask then
well id happily have a large discussion about this but the question here is extremely widefirst of all the nano nerf while its long due is a sign that something more wrong than nano is on nano happens mostly due to the blobs going on its simple causeblobs and effectnanobut small gang pvp has died tons of times at this point having been a pirate ever since i started playing smallgang warfare is still extremely viable at this point even without nano you would be surprised how well a hac or two can pvp in the right areasits still beyond me why jump bridges had to be implemented its just as bad as nanos it encourages blobbingat this point antiblob weapons and things like that are an oxymoron i honestly believe what needs to happen is that ccp needs to rework warfare so that small gangs are encouraged we discussed how we could move something like the factional warfare system into 00 just much more advanced and multitiered i think thats a solution blobs will never die nor should it be restricted but people should benefit from having a smaller gang
not running for csm but have taken a large part in the discussions with a lot of parties on all ends and had the opportunity to look over whats been said from a lot of anglesi do believe there are some unhealthy things about 00 and that most of the start with the onetrickpony pos solution particular to the whole smallgangblob argument is that there is no granularity on the low end we have solo players as targets on the high end we have towers as targets arguably station services but who really caresif an alliance chooses to escalate the scale of engagement there is no dimmer switch its either on or off you either work very small or very large no targets lie between the two extremes theres not much of a role for medium sized subcap gangs once you go capital youre committing and end up having to blob to try and avoid being rolledthe fight broker in 00 warfare basically boils down to the pos and warfare at the pos is essentially a binary engagement mechanicthe binary nature is created by the timezone balancing system that exists to protect alliances from getting 3am blitzkrieged pos timers effectively eliminate the potential for hitandrun tactics surprise suffers greatlythe solution i believe is to look at the current system figure out whats working and duplicate the working bits in between the extremes of pos and no posas a fight broker poss are functioning correctly the stront timer mechanic does tell us when to meet and does keep timezone from being a dominant or reliable mechanicwith regard to allowing more mobile and tactically interesting warfare the solution is simply that the fight needs to exist on several grids simultaneously and with increasing returns for presence at the majority of those pointsto add the granularity that the system currently lacks implement new structures that derive their value from increasing the income of 00 and exist at a level smaller than the pos and with a smaller maximum reinforced timer smaller timers smaller rewards smaller risks and smaller defensive advantages everything the pos is as a fight broker and an income instrament but in a smaller bite that will attract action to medium sized gangsin short the solution will look like this a multigrid instrument of income that acts to add more granularity in targets engagement sites riskreward and fightbrokeringin addition following on the philosophies ive been pushing forward in the acdc thread id like to see these new structures implemented as autoconstructing with a much smaller initial investment and a focus on pvp success affording one the ability to field them rather than pveve grinding to come up with the fuelbsgodforsakentriptoempire required
after standing back and looking forward towards a future where no capsuleer is left behind  i find it necessary to point out a disconcerting characteristic of mmosfirst are mmos designed to bring out the inner adventurer or to attract the adventurous in the latter case one could argue that no mmo player is truly adventurous having resorted to an online escape to satiate their needs however the key is that the content of mmos is not otherwise sensible in the real worldsecond who has the most to gain from the widespread proliferation of mmos while the immediate benefactor is ccp blizzard etc there is something much much more sinister going on millions of people who would without the available source mmos naturally discover new modes of life in the real world are instead slave to the dumb terminals known as the clientask yourself who could possibly want to pour such a huge source of raw human potential into a sink such as an mmo who has the most to gain from the added stability of keeping so much flow potential hidden in the singularity formed by mmos and mmo players eve and capsuleersthe answer is world domination in order to establish more predictable targets of control its necessary to remove or preoccupy entities with a high propensity for discovering life outside the control structures yes overlord powers are seeking to assimilate the adventurous of the world and morph them into a more benign slobbering doritomunching catastrophe known collectively as nerdsmmos are the work of  cheneycompanies such as ccp and blizzard have been established in order to attract adventurous elements of society and remove them from circulation thus dropping the total value of the world so that the dollar will rise and the us can finance its way out of the massive debt crisis its currently facing its been one giant plan all alongthe key to the functioning of eve in this role is to ensure that capsuleers never fight other capsuleers directly force them into roles where they must outmine one another and fuel the most towers if capsuleers ever came into contact on a regular basis they would have fun and this would reverse the flow of souldestruction leading to a new generation of capsuleers who were bright and cheery and liked hello kittythis is the evil that must be stopped eve is a massive computer system trying to download our souls even ccp employees have been duped its all a giant conspiracy and the only way out of it is to make the game pure fun
these are my personal and rather uninformed ranting on a question i havent really though about a loti think that the problem is that a single defensive pos cannot effectively hurt a dreadfleet that is properly managedwhat i would like to see is a situation where a cap fleet approaching an enemy death star defended by mulitple large guns is certain to take serious losses by those guns this would in turn neccessitate using battleships to take out the large guns before exposing the dreads battleships have a sig radius that should make them invulnerable to large guns but very vulnerable to medium gunsso a pos defended by both large and medium guns would require cruiser sized ships to engage to take out the medium guns before exposing the battleships to take out the large guns before exposing the dreads to take out the pos itself in comes the small pos guns to deal with cruisersfrig sized hulls could then be brought to bear to take out the medium guns and no pos guns should have a prayer of instapopping a frig  webbed scrambled or notcombining this with making pos guns a lot more expensive than they are today and also making it take a looong time to online them 48 hours would make pos warfare require all sorts of ships being used in offensive actionsinstead of having the cyno jammer outside the pos shields it should be placed inside making an attacking fleet need to take down the whole pos before jumping in the capscombine this with making the onliningofflining of cyno jammers take 48 hours or more the defenders will have to think seriously about where they want their caps and supercapsall in all this should encourage a lot of fleet fights using smaller ships  at least thats the ideai honesty though im no fleet wizard and havent got a clue what im talking aboutim just sitting at work being rather bored
i have for a long time supported this idea and have high hopes for its implementation this xmasssigned
i hope this silliness gets fixed im sick of slowboating all around the pos wondering all the while why would anyone in their right mind put these so far apart
definitely agree the modules were an issue when ships like the caracal were using it as a standard fit but the ships designed to use it should make life hell for their target

the failure of ccp with the black ops class is obvious from the massive discontinuity of feedbackthey need this they need that the only thing everyone agrees on is that like stealth bombers the class is worthless in gamemore depressing is the realization that stealth bombers still havent been fixed so why do we expect black ops to be the fact that a black ops requires someone to have trained cyno lvl 5 and to have snuck past a gate camp into a system that isnt cynojammed and is within the very limited range of the bowait does that happenwellthis shipeven with covert ops cloak a huge and separate fuel bay an extended jump range and better stats than the t1 variants still requires support from other characters to do anythingprenerf is one thing please try thingsits not like you cant undo a change if the entire infrastructure of eve falls apart due to the superomgpwnedshipofchoice tips the balance of powerby the way why shouldnt a massively hightraining required t2 bs be the ship of choice

the problem isnt with the falcon the ship itself we have all agreed on that i even changed the op to mirror this the problem is a falcon has absolutely no way of being countered succesfully unless you fit three eccms in which case you wont have room for anything else useful or use another falcon so im suggesting eccm be given a boost or maybe a leadership bonus that improves the sensor strength of all ships without having to use a command ship
i agree considering it costs nothing to set up your own 1 man corp the argument about not wanting the obligations of being in a player corp are bs theres no real reason to be in an npc corp other than to avoid being wardecd having to pay a tax for a benefit that those in player corps do not have only seems fairplus the game could use more isk sinks
i dont see why a player in an npc corp should be taxedit feels to me like the rich saying they want to become richerif you cannot get people into your own corp because your tax is too high or the services youor your corp actually provide are not up to what a player likes to get from corp membershipor the game you are clearly not doing a good job at informing andor teaching that aspirantmember what the game has to offeri myself am not worried about a 10 tax from my corpalliance because i want to be in low sec not everyone is prepared to pay that price accept it dont make it mandatorynot supported
corp based taxes if npc would go to nothing although i do not like carebears and love to give em grief the only reason corps have taxes is to help fund corps goalsnpc corps have no goals therefor leave em alone just because you feel im taxed poor poor pitiful meee the big meanie npc guys should too pout pout poutstep 1 find materialsstep 2 build bridgestep 3 get over itoh and thumbs down on this idea

sorry for being late to the thread i am fairly new to the gamebeing in my first war i started looking around the biggest problem is being the defender there is no way to end the war the attacking corp in not active so i have not seen any targets to attack the idea of the command center that someone proposed is a great idea probably should require the size and toughness of the center be an option for the attacker bigger and harder to destroy makes the war more expensive to start and maintain i may mostly run an industrial corp but i am not antipvp if i could end a war by going out and fighting over something anything you would see us doing more than sitting around doing our trading waiting for this to endthe current system encourages avoidance since most actions the defender takes cannot actually end the war there needs to be risk on both sides putting an object in space that when destroyed ends the war seems like a great answer the attacker gets to decide where and what effectively dictating the terms but the attacker at least has an option to put an end to the conflict
no no and no i fly a freighter myself and fly the t2 amarr indys and i say no to this if you make a ship bigger than the impel you will easily nerf the freighter i cant state the reasons until i see the actual stats but it most likely nerf the freighter and especially the jump freighter leave it be ccp isaac
signed i support the implementation of a ship type that has 400k space in its haul and can use cans capital tractor beams would be a plus but cost has to be half of a normal freighter like 450mill
could start off by giving the caldari  amarr an industrial that is competitive with the iteron v and then something in between
signed i do love the idea of the stealth bomber in concept but the there are 5 things that hinder its use on the filed the bombs cost more then the bloody shipcan not warp into target area cloakedbomb range is to smallbomb sig res is to highbomb damage is to lowwhat i would like to see happen in the xmass pachbombs cost 13mil iskstealth bombers can fit covert ops cloaking device or a larger speed bonus wile cloaked 300 per skill level would do the trickbomb range doubled to 30km or morebomb sig res reduced to 200m or lowerbomb base damage increased by at least 25i feel these changes would make stealth bombers a more viable anti gate blob weapon
i do not agree with this at all if anything docking range should be balanced to be in line with all stations they should all have the same docking range and it should be no less then 30km from the undocking point
this should only be done if the agression timer is extended a lot it shouldnt be possible to sit on top of a station and snipe at haulers but dock up if anything with guns on it appearsfive minute agression timer should do it otherwise decreasing the docking range favors the station hugging gankers too much
supported station hugging is bloody ridiculous fair enough 30km station hug much
what has the current csm given us nothing even the latest dev blog about them is sketchy and gives not 1 single improvement that they have implementedthe csm was a body of people supposedly put in place to represent us and what have we actually got a corrupt council which is the laughing stock of the communitygiven a choice i would however vote for the total closure of this farcewhen polling day comes make closure of the csm one of the available votes then we will actually be giving the community what it wants
do you know how many topics have been brought up to ccp lots and its gonna take time for them to work on it they just finished there new network code and it took them about a years workkeep your damn pants on
not 1 improvement was listedgonna blame a year of corruption and self promotion on waiting for new network upgradeslol
sorry m8 your complaint is utterly ridiculous if you dont playdo you call your local representatives to complain about the state of the road outside of your house if you never leave it no then why do think you are in any way qualified to comment on a game you dont actually play yes then youre an assim thinking your an ass
first off im not ur matesecond if u cannot make ur point without name calling u have no place in this discusion3rd i pay for my accounts thus i have the right to an opinionwtb a clue
this is a forum you are not texting you are also not trying to save time typing type out your words spellcheck doesnt hurt either we all pay for our accounts just because you pay for yours does not mean your opinion matters more than other people messing with the timetable will not change the confidence factor of the csm it would only be more costly to ccp
at no point have i stated that my opinion is more important than anyone elses so yes you are correct the forums is a place where people state thier opinions as have i and those supporting this thread and the many others which have slated the current csm membersfurther more fyi i am in fact posting from my phoneyour not very good at this debating lark are youwtb a clue loltastic
whilst i dont believe that moving the timetable for the elections will change anything i do however agree that the current bunch of cretins needs removing they have been an embaresment to the community and a disgrace the minutes from their meetings show them to have been nothing more than bickering children on a power trip here is to hoping that the next bunch are more pro in their approach
you can have a relevant opinion only if you are knowledgeable about the subject in which you are commenting on since you have not played eve in 2 years then you do not know wtf is going on so you should stfuclaiming that you know the needs and desires of the player base when you dont even play is a pretty moronic statement
please dont fool yourself folks the csm was a response to a tad of bad publicity and shouldnt be confused as a empowered entity of substance in the cogs of the ccp machineat best its a idea exchange ccp uses to funnel the inundation of both worthy and stupendously silly player game improvement suggestions so that they can devote less personnel to dealing with this facet of customer interactiondont take it as a slam ccp in fact it was a brilliant move from a marketing perspective however utilizing a few more token suggested improvements would have made the program go over more with the massesanyway best of luck whoever wins you have my sympathy and condolences my only suggestion to whoever is elected is that they open up the transparency more to the masses that put them in office even if its just as silent observers at a online meeting or question and answer sessions on a reg basis and unedited transcripts in there entirety or something along those lines
it woudnt have been a bad idea to take the ten most called for player suggestions held a vote on the forums to see which of those would be raised at the next csm meeting many union branches use this method to raise transparency and ensure that they are a true representation of their membersofc our merry lil band of corrupt council members would never have agreed to this
how sad 19 responses and not a single thumb upok here is my thumb up in support of miz cenuij proving to us once again what an immature little arse he is thanks for reminding us of that
i havve made reasonable arguments and backed them up you have only resulted to insults who is immaturelol
youve not played eve for 2 years and yet you come in here beating your war drumwho the  do you think you areseriously i dont care what amount of history you got you cant go around making assumptions and speaking for the community at large if you have not been around for the last 2 yearshow about you start playing eve again for the next 2 years and then make your conclusionssome of us i would assume can speak for ourselves thank you very muchor better yet go back to playing wow againdamn trolls
i realize the above is probably a troll but just in case please please tell me that isnt true that is so sad and pathetic i have no words to describe it if its true stop paying now spend the money on therapy sessions instead or on something that will get your mind off this game get some real friends go out side get laid whatever do not pay for eve dont post here  try to live your next 2 years without being bitter and angry man youre wasting your life
immature enough to have given you your only thumbs up in this thread thats how immature i amp
umm majority of the topics raised at csm meetings are topics from this forum the rest are from the csm delegates who by their own rules posted those topics here before having them raised in a meeting im not sure how that differs from what youre suggestingoh and hi miz
i agree with mizjudging by the number of similar threads so do many peoplelol  the csm alts raging in this threadyour time has come  out you go
hi omber its different in a couple of ways100 of topics raised at csm meetings should come from the manner i proposed this way it does not allow csm members to push their own biased subjects and agendasalso prior to any meeting the player base would be aware of the agendas 5 key points and as such could fairly expect feedback on said points afterwards with clear action points and accountabilities for suchas it stands right now the csm can select at will which of the hundreds of subjects on these forums that they wish to talk about and ignore those they do not invariably they have chosen subjects which further their own endsfurther detailed feedback as demonstrated above has not been forthcoming from the amateurs currently within the csm all we receive are edited minutes of their meetings and a dev blog which has failed to list so much as 1 acheivment the csm has driven throughbtw im logging in more and more so ill see you in space zombie
it is my hope that the majority of people who play this game understand the importance of having their voices heardand how counterproductive it would be to allow it to be degraded into a forum version of alliance warfareweve seen some very productive discussions and implementations even taking into account recent flame festswhich tells me that there is much more that can be done
who says its overpriced  what constitutes overpriced in 2 months a decent inventor char can get close to 2 bil isk a halfdecent manufacturer can get over 1 bil isk a 2 hours a workday and 10 hours per weekend l4 missionrunner can get over 3 bil isk or a veldspar mining putting in the same amount of work can get over 1 bil iskid call that underpricedquit some accounts or quit playing altogether or just get a job and pay cash problem solved
clearly they arent expensive enough if people are still paying the price for this outdated bugged and generally not very good gameyou have to remember that the price of gtcs is directly based on the willingness of the playerbase to convert dollarseurossheep into isk with the world economy slowing people are less willing to waste money on such silly thingscertainly ccp could help out the playerbase with prices by actually banning farmer accounts instead of leaving them active so they can track the isk then remove it from idiot rmter accounts that would result in less income for them though so dont expect that
this isnt the first time ive seen this claim regarding fake orders and it isnt the first time ive seen no evidence presented to back it up what exactly does a fake order look likei doubt anyone is forcing you to run 4 accounts perhaps you should consider consolidating your core characters onto one or two accounts during this lean period youre facingexactly say no to the dirty pinko scum seriously though im not opposed to the return of 30  90 day cards or some variation of these but im more inclined to think this is just a case of supply and demand being felt more and more by the whiny element in the communityi tend to feel a little smug about the whole thing now because the moment i heard about the changes i loaded my account up until next year while 90 day codes were still available and priced in the 300m to 350m range in fact when i got a little spare currency today i turned that into a 60 day code and exchanged it for 485m within half an hour
gtc are worth exactly as much isk as ppl are willing to pay for them and cannot be overpriced

the problemunder the current game mechanics npc factioncorp standing is only obtainable in reliable quantities through missions with factional warfare and cosmos players can get limited amounts of standing but the underlying principles of cosmos does not differ significantly from normal mission running and factional warfare only offers a quite limited amount of faction standing nor any corporation standing besides standing with the respective militias through the completion of objectivespersonally i dont like areas of the game being so limited to a certain playstyle there is a large part of the playerbase that simply is not interested in missionrunning yet they require standing for other areas of the game such as setting up a pos or having access to datacoresthe fixreliable standing gains should be obtainable through other means which are accessible to different playstylesright howone mechanic would be through exploration mechanic that is already part of the game pick up sos signal rescue a sisters of eve vessel from the clutches of the blood raiders and gain a bit of standing and loyalty points for your troubles just an example im sure people can be more creative than this even better would be situations that offered players a choice as to which faction they want to assist tip the balance for the serpentis or sansha setup can be akin to infamous worlds collide mission with two faction bases in a single deadspace pocket as usual the more dangerous the system the better the rewardsanother issue is that scienceindustrialist players are also unable to partake in missions miners can at least get some mining missions although they suck i know but there is no way to research or produce for some juicy standing it would be nice if the npc factions would tax these players with the production of goods or a contribution to research to prevent industrialists from buying goods off the market an agent should instead provide an item which is then placed into an assembly array or lab and produced or researched this would take job slots as normalpvp orientated players are also a group that is not very happy with the current situation and the solutions above does not answer their woes for this type of player i suggest a more openended system where players can get bounties or standing boost through the elimination of players with high standing in an opposing faction how to prevent people from selling themselves for kills or people shooting their alts i do not know but possible avenues would be that a player can only provide standing once every x time or that the standing gain is based on the amount of financial damage inflicted on the victimthanks for reading suggestions and discussion welcome
by killing players with negative standings or with high standings to opposed factionsedit diminishing returns for killing the same player eg gallante gives a relatively large standing boost to the next guy that pods me a 50 smaller one next time etcor balance it with faction hits as well as boosts anyone who kills me gets a boost to gallente but a loss to caldari
if it is made easier to manipulate standings they should matter a bit more and be more interrelatedalso there is the ever present issue of recovering from negative standing and the lack of tools to do sopossible ways to include standingsnpc buy orders for things pod pilots makeacquire at varying   isk  volume the danger of course is it will put a min buy on those products as no one would sell for less than the npcs will buy it but lets argue for the moment that they will have buy orders for the base value of minerals they need those so when you sell the caldari navy 1m units of trit you get a 01 increase in standing with the caldari navy alternatively they npc corps could issue contracts for these goodsresearch  industry agents providing missions similar to the starter missions in the tutorial mission arch the tree contains a mission where you are given a bp  told make this for us more of these possibly including what are currently npc goods would be help there i thinki am sure there are other options just some ideas
that is the most important part that needs adressing the pos is a industialists tool and there should be a way without mission grinding that gets you the standings to be able to hang a pos all you are doing by not changing this is giving another easy another income stream to missioners who already got a isk printing machine by doing lvl 4s have heard the same thing mentioned a few times on the forums but never really seen a decent fix for this come forward certainly there should be a way which means industrials can get these standings without either hireing a missioner to fix there standings or doing missions themselves but still something that takes a similar about to time and trouble btw im a missioner who has done corp fixing jobs in past so its not sour grapes on my part
how about gaining small faction increases for buying and selling in the market the rationale here being that the better the market the better the factions economy is and that is better fort the faction not sure if it would be possible to prevent abuse of that by having two people buying  selling the same expensive things backwards and forwards to push up their standings but if the increase is small that agent commission will start to add up i guessi do like the idea of selling goods to npc corps  particularly if that moves over to fw as well i dont enjoy pvp but i really like factionbuilding i would like to be able to support my chosen militia in logistical or supply terms rather than going all out pew pew  after all real armies very quickly learn the importance of good supply and support or they dont achieve very much
certainly the war efforts of the various empires need supporting especially in the form of missions to produce equipment for the war effort  at higher lvl missions ammo and weapons at lower levels they could be given specific bpcs for components like the fictious ore types in mining missionsand yes outside of the fw system there should be some standings bounty available to players outside of missionsat the end of the day even with vast empires as your dealing with here most of the populations efforts would go towards the war effort beyond simply shooting things that is
due to the csmccp online meeting held this weekend were rescheduling meeting 11 to sunday 11th of october
i agree with the op csms have been biased and corrupt since its inception
wish they would end the embarrassing experimentcsm show their ass and get nothing actually accomplishedthe only thing that i am curious about is how long ccp will front this drama dreamplease disband and forget it was ever here
actually the csm gets things brought to the attention of the ccp devs you just dont see anything concrete due to a lag phase as the ideas are used to shape future expansions and patches the csm has brought a large number of issues to ccps attention this round and its obvious from meetings with ccp that the csm is appreciated and valued there are always doomsayersbut i find its usually better to try and be positive and constructive if i didnt think the csm made a difference i wouldnt be running again this voting roundbut i am running again vote wisely make a differencetake carebruce hansen arithron
why
defense
shouldnt defence be up to the holders of the system to provide rather than let some automated npc mechanic do it for youheck why not just have sov 4 give you npc roaming enforcers who concordokken annyone they find if they belong to the wrong alliance
good its 1 less of last years corrupt council members who can retain his position
would imagine that he is one of the few that have got their brains in most of the time tbh most others not let their lack of knoweldge in certain areas stop them from spouting crap about it and only one or two can be seen to have a proper discussion and thinks about the matter in hand instead of just saying the same things over and over in the belief that the more words you write the more people will think you great one of the others i think people have respect for is the goon dude he has on the whole represented his side of the game well and has rational thoughts and tries to see each side of debate
appreciate your answers i know my q was quite large for vista this was about 00 i know you can pvp qo nanos in small gangs in lowsec not in 00 you simply cant go much further down the pipe that 23 jumps from empire youll get titanized most likely or blobbed like  ofc atm its possible in the south because bob isnt home but when they come this are goes down the drainand for the other answer this wasnt for the guys who want to take pos down this was about getting fights trying to make living of pvp and generally ganking peeps in 00 i dont care much for sov anyways
now considering before the csm things changed when people whined enoughthis is the same even todayso what has the csm actually done i posit nothingwhat is the csm actually about or around to dobefore if people whined but ccp wasnt going to change it ccp was essentially saying no to those players thusly ccp looks badnow people whine some 12 year old people argue with eachother and vote to say yes or no then pass it on this essentially filters out loads of the nos then finally when ccp doesnt change it its the csm who said no and not the csm thusly ccp looks like they are the neutral or good guysnow i would like someone to prove me wrong what has changed because of the csm that ccp wouldnt change normally
the csm allows for the voice of many to be voiced through few its a poll like system that is bring many changes into the next expansionit allows for ccp to hear what the players want and to give feedback on all the ideas that have a lot of community supportit also gives the players a real path of action if a dev is caught cheating againnow now i know everyone has their own way of posting or voting blah blah but overall this sort of thing is needed as the playerbase inceasesit worked really well in jumpgate 3 years ago its not doing too bad nowhowever its very very rusty and needs work to smooth it out however i hope to see it become a feature of eve that lasts forever
a lot of things are still in the development pipeline black ops boosts for examplewhat ive personally achieved that is actually in the game now suicide ganking rebalance factional warfare mission difficulty rebalancewhat is in the pipeline drone implants hopefully the return of the 30 day gtcthings currently in discussion drone behaviour fixes small anchorable structures more crossfaction ships what will help out eve in the long run contributions to industrialist expansion mission review
you personally as if you were the csm all by your glorious self proofs to me that this is nothing more but a theater for bloated egos
just read what you want to read abrazzarat least i know im not spending a lot of time every week polishing my ego
omg you dont honestly think that you personally did that did you  apart from that insight into youre greatness that did or will not come about because of the csm it was being talked about before and a rebalance was on the way weather you like to admit it or not the other thing in the pipeline you mention are not what the csm will achieve but others they will come up with the ideas that will be acted upon and as always others  just like you did re the suicide gank thing  will claim credit sure some ideas will emerge from csms esp with the industry fix but i bet more stupid ideas will come forward from people who are not really industrialists but think cause they are carebears they got to speak on every subject non pvp around i personally feel the jury still out on the csm and it could be good just egos and petty politics and are getting in the way and not neccessarily from the ones youd think
you mean as opposed to the pvp players  pirates who think they have to speak on every carebear subject aroundeveryone has an opinion which they are entitled to share  it may be more or less informed than other peoples and it may be different to your own but its still a valid opinionmy opinion on those who constantly dis the csm is that they fail to realise that the csm can only function if the players get behind it anyone purposefully trying to hinder the process or drag it down seems to be failing to understand that the point of the exercise is to improve eve for everyone if you look at the voting records all of the delegates have voted for things that have a personally detrimental effect but which are better for eve as a whole or not voted for things that would have had a detrimental effect if they had gone throughit is clear that others have different opinions but i say to them that if they dont think that the csm works please feel free to propose an alternate method to filter the signal from the noise of thousands of forum posts every day so that ccp dont accidentally listen to the whinings of a vocal minority and implement something that is great for 5 of the player base but bad for the other 95i for one am glad to have this vehicle and quite impressed that ccp have tried to give players a voice i think they could have implemented it better and supported it better but its a lot better than having nothing there at allit is difficult to say what the csm has achieved this early on many of the proposed changes require considerable development and testing time and will not come to fruition in this or even the next incarnation of the csm there is something on the table that when a change is patched that has happened as a direct result of the csm that it is highlighted as such as this will help everyone see that the csm actually works and improve public confidence in the mechanism
trolling is cheap and easystanding up for what you believe in and trying to get things changed takes gutsbet you wont be putting yourself forward as a candidate
while english not native lauguage i thought i said that just cause someone a carebear not mean they got any knowledge of industry and their ideas may not be good ones  nothing about pvpers thinking they industrialists or industrialist saying about pvp aspects seen a lot of csm members just say a idea is silly or stupid etc if disagree with it and seem to think that thier title will be ok and they not need a rational counter to it
didnt like their opinions or attitude  dont vote for them next time or vote for someone who better represents your opinion  or even better stand for electiondidnt challenge their stupid opinions when you had a chance  not their fault its yourscouldnt challenge their stupid opinons get elected and change things so people cant
why is it slam the csm weeki mean seriously do you people love to just kick dirt in everyones faceits bad enough all the pirates and gankers yell carebear at there own shadowsnow we got a ton of whiners and morons who completely throw rationality out the window for the sake of breaking the windowdid you all forget that the csm has the unique ability of directly interfacing with ccpthink about it out of 30 thousand some odd gamers who all have there own little pet peeves and a very small number of them get the chance thanks to this csm system to voice those thoughts and opinionslike i ranted about in a previous topic there is no such thing as a democracy theres always some damn bunch of idiots who think they know it all and grind an axe as soon as you make a mistake or ignore themand here you are trying to burn that bridge you honestly think it would improve the situation even after the factyes people make mistakes people screw up people are selfish welcome to the human raceso in short stop throwing a fit and get off your lazy  and do something about itlike running for the csmi swear must you people throw your brains out the door every whim and chance you geti support csm for the fact that the communications pipeline granted narrow and not entirely clear is the only way to get things done and fixed in the world of eve without having give into the mass rioting and screaming mob mentality thats why its there and it makes ccps job easierccp may not be perfect but its certainly better than most gaming administrations ive met in the time ive been gaming for and its been a very very long time since i started playing onlinewith all due respect if your going to throw a fit stfu or gtfobecause all your doing is wasting our valuable time and looking like an idiotscreaming and complaining only slows the process down or makes it worseand while i feel like im contradicting myself in saying that at least im complaining at the complainersso how about coming up with a solution as opposed to starting a flamewaroh wow what a great idea drakewell duhps as for what changed i can see a lot has changed your just too jaded to even notice its called progress small yes not as grandiose as some would like it but it is progress
having had insight from within on the csm serving as an alternate i can say without hesitation that the csm has made a difference ccp listen to player concerns and issuesproposals and use this information to inform and plan future developmentsexpansions there is invariably a lag phase between issues reaching ccp and their implementation which is to be expected when developmentbalancing etc is involvedim running for the csm because i believe players need such a route to have their voices heard and its imperative that the csm interact and listen to the player base at large on issues having just finished with a ccp meeting records posted hopefully next week i am feeling very positive on the future of the csm and the importance given to it by ccptake carebruce hansen arithron
mothermoon recites democracys talking point ya thanks for coming bythe devs admitted before black ops went live that they prenerfed it and they plan to boost it in the future obviously the csm has absolutely nothing to do with thatso you are part of this csm interesting though just glancing at your post it is very respectable of a post so i give you propssuicide ganking whining existed long before the csm ill keep this one neutrali was on sisi for fail warfare testing i put in my many cents which got many dev responses up until i got podkilled a couple times and lost all my sp dont think csm really has much to say for thischribba and myself i know have multiple threads which were before the csm and had devs saying that they are looking into it but not any time soon perhaps it is coming up now id say that one is given to chribbathis one would truly be a real csm victory considering how much whining is happening and nothing is being done csm would get credit then again if you notice you use the word hopefully yes well you notice how you have no sway over what ccp is going to dothere are some good and funny little flash videos showing this honestly though that recent change really made it good yes sometimes drones do what they are told too and instead shoot what their autotarget is or they split into 2 groups this is far from what was happening beforei posted this idea which split off into a much larger discussion and eventually got linked into the sticky in features forum csm really isnt doing much here and finally we comment on the wholethings currently in discussionthese arent changesnow lets discuss how many ideas have been shot down by the csm and not ccp i bet theres a load of themthis kind of proves my point csm achieves nothing good in theory not practical ccp is a company who do what they do they likely even have rough plans of what each expansion will be about in the next couple yearsps where i say i posted the idea it just is to elaborate how me and about 20000 other people have also posted the ideas
how much money are these people making for their time i suspect its closer to 0 which last i checked was slavery sorry im not a slave i can however post my ideas here and there and ccp will likely read thembecause ive been bothered to read about how the csms term is up and how an age limit is being imposed and such the csm is getting attention because of that the csms record is also up and available and a batting record of 0 is pretty badisnt there a podcast people who talk with greyscale all the time thats direct interfacing oh and recall devs post in the forums they at least read them meaning thats direct interfacing as well csm has nothing specialburn what bridge there clearly is no discourse they seemingly say nothing to the devs because nothing changes
so you admit bias and then make a statement hahyes well before the csm existed people did exactly the same thing make threads with hundreds of responses and then change happens thats how it happens still then again im still waiting for the nano nerfs take 3 csm has nothing to do with thisyep we propose stuff 2 years ago and it gets implemented now csm then pretends to take credit heres how it actually works either goto features or game development make thread nerf titan dd get 50 friends to post in there to say how the dd needs to be nerfed and what changes could be to be reasonable then because of popularity of thread in there loads of other people show up to say something also then eventually change happens then we get 1 hour cooldownthats how change happens
wow okay first post basically your argument is that csm have gotten nothing done in 6 months where as 20000 people whining for a couple of years have achived loads of stuff except that all the examples of things they have achieved havnt happen yet and are about to happen in other words it took over 2 years plus to achieve anythingthen you have the cheek to say that the csm are useless cause they have achieved nothing in 6 monthsyou need to buy a dictionary and look up the word hypocritslavery yep last time i checked the dictionary volunteer is another definition of slave  oh wait just rechecked and you have completely misunderstood what a volunteer is let me help you what it isnt is a trollyou expect them to have done so much in 6 months and yet you havnt got the guts to try and do 110 as much as they have you are however willing to take the glory for what other people have achieved just because you replied to a couple of threads on the forumsone of the main blocks to communication between the player base and the ccp are the forums where people like you elitist clichy forum warriors who make the forums so unwelcoming to anyone outside your narrow group of friends or outside your narrow minded point of viewremember the old saying  if your not part of the solution your part of the problem  guess what
actualy jason what you are refering to used to be called flamingand with the csm it is now a much more orderly discusionthings dont just get spammed they get discussed and in a lot of cases acted upon
if they supposedly can do so much they should have at least gotten 1 thing changedwhiners get stuff changed more often then the csm apparentlyactually all my examples are quite live events a titan cant fire its dd as long as it has enough caperm i was born with 2 cheeks so yes i have cheek yes well the record is evident that things change due to whiners within 6months or less these whiners arent in some csm deal that speaks directly to the devsyes well i would be a hypocrit if things didnt change but they do because of whinersas we established using the points that a csm member put out the csm did nothing so 110 of nothing is still nothing infact ive done 10109574636 times more then them which is still nothing at least according to you i have on the otherhand been on sisi doing things and bug reporting etc etc thats something meaning i really have done more then the csm though i will admit the csm members most likely also contribute alsoi never took credit i just put it in that light because it fits tons of other whiners with me also get credityou only a few sentences were calling me a troll yet i think i am at least bringing something to the table valid examples and arguments you on the otherhand want to throw around these ad homninems i do believe i have been rather cordialyou are certainly strong with the fallacious arguments
id also like to point out that this doesnt count for private communications such as private channels you can pretty much say what you want when you want if anyone doesnt like it they can block youbeing vulgar or offensive in local channel though is inappropriate
where can i find the minutes from these csm meetings there seems to be allot of meetings but nothing actually coming out the other endthankscj
come on ccp  stop hiding and come out and tell us when this is going to be done and csm seems that lvv is the only one who actually keeps us updated where the hell are you come out and tell us why in the world you have not pushed this with ccp hard enough i mean come on other issues made and were heard about and this thing has ben just hanging here i do not think this is the best way for you guys to appear in the upcoming elections
barrage affects gun tracking as i stated before ammo that affects the gun only affects that gun and no other so you only get one incidence of the penalty for that weaponhail affects your cap regen so each weapon penalizes the ship as a whole the penalties stack reducing your capacitor regeneration to effectively nil while using hailif they do nothing more they should look at this unbalanced disparity that renders certain t2 ammos downright dangerous to attempt using missiles most notably and considerably less useful than their base t1 counterparts much less faction
one skill train allthis would make things easier and more fun
while i also would like the bo to get a boost to their combat abilities i think people are taking this too seriouslyremember many items boats cars planes cell phones computers ect are rushed to market before they are ready for releasealso remember that many are released with poor design and functionalityi speak from experience in that many pieces of equipment at my work are released after being designed by engineers yet no actual field personal being involved and they fail miserablyit happensnow i would like to see ccp improve the bo but release it from a different manufacturer with different features this would be more realisticbut just cause the first release sucks and dont get me wrong it does truly suck does not mean that it is the end of the world as in the real world sales would slump and plummet until a rework of the ship or a different company released a model with different attributesbut just remember that it just might turn into a covert hauler type role rather then the role that most of the community would prefer the af is a good example as are afterburners both have limited uses and both are not popular in many pvp situationsit happensif ccp would release a design model that allowed players to exchange features on a ship to create truly unique craft so we could redesign it ourselves then that would be a leap in not only the pvp side but the manufacturing and research areas of the gametill then we just have to realise that ccp might just write the bo off as a failed ship release and move on to more important game issues like lag war dec mechanics the sovereignty rules adding more systems or many other more critical areas of eve that really do have a larger impact then fixing the bodont get me wrong i would love to see a tier 2 ship based on the domi its just that honestly it is not as important to the enjoyment of eve by the majority of the playerbase it is a ship for players who have been here a whileanyway just my 3 isk
alot of people like to point to the jump bridging ability of the blackop as the defining charateristic of this and itd intended implementation  imho i feel this is completely ridiculous  why would someone train the supportand required skills for a ship that use is sending other ships into combat what fun is there in simply standing on the pier waving while oters go to war  well it does have a combat ability  well no it doesnt beacuse they are inferior to their t1 cousins in combat  so what do you get for your considerable isk and time investment 1 a battle ship that has traded combat ability for jump drive ability which is rendered useless by game mechanics involving sovereignity and cynojammers2 a battle ship that has a very limited jump bridging ability which is further limited by the issues in 13 a battle ship that in the end cannot compete directly with its t1 couterpart in use vs expense  in dps  cept widow   and in overall survivability now look at tech2 ships in generalcompare a recon to its t1 variant which is the better shipcompare a hac to its t1 variant which is the better shipcommand shipslogistics ceptorseach of these classes has abilities far in excess of their t1 variant hence their use despite the cost  now i have posted b4 with diferent ideas on what could be improved but simply even in its current state if jumping into cyno jammed systems and covert ops cloaks were alowed i could forgive the loss of dammage and cost 
the meeting was 3 months agois tux on thisare there any plans to unnerf black opswill there ever be
signed i support any direction that bring the black ops into line as a useful ship type for behind enemy lines hit and run engagements in small gangs of coverts recons and stealth bombers
just have the stupid contract system completely ignore charges entirely voila vixed and you still cant contract a ship with 5 hull
this is annoying for so many reasons and its really dumb that one race gets it worse then the others
please visit your user settings to reenable imagessmartbombs have long been a neglected weapon system in eve online available and functional at release  theyve stayed more or less consistent ever since weve had faction variants of course tech2 variants and some mechanics involving smartbombs have changed but we are still lacking support skills for these devices to allow people to specialize as they have in drones missiles ew etc etc and were missing capital ship sized smartbombs to put on our carriers dreadnaughts motherships and titans if this issue is supported and passes the csm id like to ask ccp to make time in the next available development cycle to do a general refreshrevamprebalance of all things smartbomb and bring this system back into the mainstream of eve combat this would involve but not be limited too introducing skills for specializing in smartbombs smartbomb range smartbomb damage smartbomb energy use reductionsmartbomb rapid refire etc etcintroducing rigs and implants to boost smartbombspretty much taking a leaf from the book of current missiledrone rigsimplantsintroducing capital sized smartbombstech1 tech2 officer grade perhapsbalancing and platform interactionparticularly important for things like the unreasonable vulnerability of citadel torpedoes to current smartbombs its important that enhanced current and potential newcap class smartbombs arent ludicrously effective against missiles and drones and such random scripting musinghow about giving smartbombs a scripted mode switch indiscriminateselective  maybe allow indiscriminate mode to function as is as in everyone in range takes the hit  good for lowsec00 work or selective mode where they do half damage but only hit war enemies  criminally flagged people perhapsobvious questionsq but wont this mean pirates would camp lowsec gates with capital class smartbombing motherships again a im not sure thats such a bad thing  seriously aggression flagged motherships at gates in lowsec sounds like pvp opportunity to me q wont smartbombs become overpowered against missiledrone usersa its a fair question and i think wed have to take the example of the missile weaponry overhaul missile weapons became underpowered with inferior skills about the same on levels 23 on the support skills and slightly better at high levels of specialization i dont think thats unreasonable if a player wants to become expert in smartbombs and put a lot of their training points in that objective then i think its a good thing to let them perform better than an unskilled smartbomb user if you were trying to counter dronemissile spam it makes sense to go with smartbombs q why are you promoting this just now  has sf got some uber plan to take over fw with smartbombing typhoons you fiendish political manipulator you a i promised to raise the smartbomb issue during my csm election campaign and i honestly think its a undersupported weapon system that could do with the skills to specialize and the provision of capital ship sized smartbombs for cap on cap mayhem with proper balancing and development i think its a good addition to the eve combat cannon and will provide some additional fitting optionscomplexity for the pvp gameconclusionlets have reworking of smartbombs advocated to ccps development agenda for next year and bring this weapon system into support equality with gunsmissilesdronesew for increased variety and potential in the eve combat system ccp have teams of developers that can do the brainstorming and balance work if we let them know we care about this issue lets put it on the agenda
and 1 support because itd be rude not too
smartbombs are very narrow weapon systems at present but im not really convinced that theyre bad per se if you have a ship that you want to defend from drones they are very good because it multiplies their effective damage immensely which is why most supercapitals use them if you need to do damage instantly without a targeting delay theyre your only means to do so which gives them some utility if youre trying to collect a pod they also have some utility as missile defence but thats mostly because of a very odd interaction with the rules for defender missiles to my knowledge ultimately i like the thrust of your proposal and i think that a couple of those skills ought to be addedthough im surprised that you request a rapidfire skill given that thats what energy pulse weapons does but im not sure that smartbombs can be made good without just becoming ludicrous for example if commonly available smartbombs can go above 20 km or so in range they will virtually eliminate nano ships interceptors and small ships generally from being plausible in combat and that still wouldnt make them usable in highsec because highsec combat happens close to gates and stations which concord doesnt like you bombing one alternate proposal comes to mind  make several scripts for smartbombs to fulfill their various roles have one that shrinks the range to 12 km and drops the cap usage to allow you to clean out drones in highsec without blowing anything up if youre careful have one that increases the range dramatically but put an explosion speedradius on it like a missile for mission work have a script that limits it to a 180 degree spread so that your buddies can stand behind you safely without explicitly coding in iff mechanisms if the antimissile role is one you want to encourage have a script that increases range increases rof and decreases dps perhaps even have a script that increases range and damage dramatically to somethign near the range of a bomb but that burns out the module in a single shot for blobsmashing this would be a bit of a mess but something along these lines might be workable
i like the idea of scripting these for multiple uses would add a little smart to my bombs 
actually since ccp has indicated that details and specifics arent required theyll do the hard graft part simplify the issue towe think smartbombs could do with some loving and heres a couple examplesbeing a drone user myself i can see the drawbacks of making them more popular however i like them and would like to see them more usable with covert ops and black opstake carearithron
i am happy with skills to spec smartbombs im less sure about capitals  as far as im concerned smartbombs are already a hugely popular and powerful weapon on eg a carrier or a mothership i mean its not like we already have namedofficer capital mods
make smartbombs smart what nonsense you speakps supported
i like the idea number of things i would like to vote down 
a thumbs up for thumbs down
a thumbs up for a thumbs up for a thumbs down
signed let the mass vote ya or na
i agree with this topic
im a big fan of logistics so i very much support the concept although i think having a ship with shield transport and cap transfer and only having 2 highs isnt very effective likely need a 3 high not to mention have you reviewed cpupg use on logistics stuff
sorry ive been away for the weekend n  guns y  volleys r  reloads a  ammunition typesnowyou fire ny times checking ny times for ammunition and then reload rn times checking rn times for ammunition in the cargo bayafteryou fire n singles guns y times checking a times for how long the ammunition will lastthis isnt really about firing guns it is about movingcalculating ammunition objects when you count in all of the extra calculationsqueriesmovements that we could completely axe it does become exponentialit will check once however from a programming point of view given the amount that we have reduced the complexity already we could make our single check able to handle thatnot a hazy area at all different guns have different rates of fire and we calculate based on type of ammunition at most you have 8 calculations at the beginning of firing one for each gun this would be a worst case scenario given that most people do not load 8 different types of ammunition we can guess that the improvement in performance will be much better
got my vote
an age limit of 18 is necessary because its probably not feasible to have minors travelling abroad alone for csm meetings and suchtoo many potential issues that could crop up with laws etcan age limit of 21 is just stupid unnecessary and based only in the stereotype that people who arent 21 are dips lvv proves that false pretty well
21 is the legal drinking age in some of the most drinking stringent countries which means we will have more drunk csmsi would support 18 but 21 is a little much i mean i am 18 and i like to believe i am capable of some coherent thought

i said this before in another similiar threadhaving a tax for npc corps is pointlessfirst off if you force npc corp players to pay taxes then you have to make player owned corps do the sameie they must have a minimum tax to the npc taxsecond to be taxed for a singular benefit as you call it is worthless as wellit will not discourage those big fat isk makers from leaving the npc corp and it will put newer players at risk as wellpicture if you will the noob who has less than a million isk and finds himherself paying more tax than they can make to buy skill books supplies etcall this so a few more experienced players can have target practice bah there are much better ways of expending your energies than finding new ways to disadvantage newer players
im sure ill need a flame resistant suit for this however its a pretty simply issueif csms are banned from the forums or banned from eve they should be removed from the csm immediately gives the csm members the right to vote on whether the banned csm member is kicked from the csm one vote may be taken per forum banning this should be the case for both temporary and permanent bans the issue i can see with this is that it provides ccp with a mechanism for removing csm members so it would need to be documented that the person in question has received warnings first and notified to the whole csm that this is occuringon the other hand  do you really want someone who gets banned representing younote the situation of what happens when a csm member gets removed is already dealt with an alternate is raised up in their place in order of max votes receivedvoteedit revised based on feedback text removed text added
i thought this was the case already of course this has to be done
you need both forums and game to interact with the csm now that we have the csm forum and a csm member who is banned on one of those or both channels will not be able to function in the csm anymoreit would make sense to remove them from the csm especially when it concerns permanent bans
makes sense to me at the minimum an elected csm delegate needs to be able to keep to the basic rules of conduct on the forums and in game so they can set an example to the playerbase
support this initiative
isnt this already the case i thought that if someone got banned from the game they got booted from the csm if ythey dont then i would support changing that and i dont think that a forum ban is necessarily ejectionworthy  it certainly shouldnt be automatic
considering ccps occasional triggerhappy approach to bans this has pretty impressive potential for abuse
its clear from the documents that csm members are expected to follow high standards of behaviour at all times getting oneself forumbanned should be enough to get oneself removed from the csm as its pretty hard to discuss and interact in jita hall etc without the ability to post id also suggest that the actions that resulted in the forumbanning probably dont reflect well on the csm all organisations have the bring into disrepute clause for removal from office id lose my jobtake carearithron
given that you cannot apply to be on the csm if you have had a ban in the past that seems not unreasonable
not supported first ccp has already demonstrated unwillingness to get involved on that level of the csm second forum mods should not have that kind of power over the csmoh and third the potential for abuse of in game petition system and the like wasting time of ccp employees is immense
in the process of changing my signature ive come across another text length limit  sigs are limited to like 200 characters which effectively means you cant have more than one link in it there should be limits on sig size in the sense of making sure that they dont dominate a page when youre reading them but you should be able to put in a bunch of links if you want to
its important to make the distinction between character limits on ingame mechanisms and outofgame ones out of game the limit could be relaxed although as others quite rightly point out some players will ramble on and on and oningame the limit is there to prevent exploits ccp are pretty clear about this and are looking at alternate ways of fixing it for some future point mail is getting a revamp so expect some fixing there im hoping for a sent items folder optionits a shame that players choose to exploit such innocuous looking areas of the game system ill live with the character limit rather than the consequences of exploitation any day thoughfor a fuller update read the latest csmccp notes when released later in the weektake carearithron
this is just an idea its based on the current ingame mechanics at the moment you can buy shares from corps and get a reasonable return based on the isk you put into it this we all know but it is easy to get scammedmy suggestion is to have npc version of this feature your character continues to grow and gain skills while your afk at work or simply taking a break for a few days why not have the option to utilize your isk in this waysay for instance if i wanted to buy 100 interbus shares as a result i get x amount of isk per share per dayhour for my investmentunderstandably this would have an effect on players curently trying to sell thier corp shares if everybody was to invest in npcs the smaller starup crops would sufferthis could be combated by making the npc shares less appealing i spend 1 million isk on 1 share which generates me approx 1 of my investment per hour for my troubles so for spending 1 million isk i get 1000 isk an hour you could limit the amount of shares one could hold per corp and you could increase the amount of isk generated based on standing with the corp kind of like level agents buying 1000 shares from a level 1 npc agent would only generate you a small amount of isk but buying 1000 shares from a level 4 agent would be more expensive but ultimaly generates you more isk per hourdayobviously player run corps could offer higher rates of interest the thier npc counterparts this would make them more appealing and actuly create some competition and possibly a new price war for a previously overlooked area of the gameso whats the point of all this players no matter what level they are can generate isk while afk just like thier skill points it costs money to do but the longer you hold the shares the more likly your are to see a return not insain amounts of cash but enough to feel like your actuly earning somthing while afkthis is just a rough idea i had nothing set in stone any commentspossible changes that peeps want to add please dothanks for your time guys cs
okan agenda is posted before the meeting agenda items need to be submitted to the chair by friday for a sunday meeting so that this is possible the agenda can be found in the forum below us after meeting minutes are also posted as for hosting of such im still waiting for a ccp minutes page update in the same thread unfortunately action points are hard to put in as the csm doesnt know the action ccp will take until the topics are submitted to ccp and they get a response back as many have pointed out csm is more a vetting process of what topics are raised with ccp on behalf of the players rather than a task force of fixing things themselves asking csm to action things is pointless  they cantcsm can select their own topics to champion but the public can champion their own topics too if a topic gets enough thumbs up votes its automatically added to the agenda as per the rules governing the csmthe edited minutes are there for the reason that if unedited they would include a whole bunch of irrelevant side chatter last meeting included an entire conversation about nero electing a horse to be a senator in the roman council they also need to be checked for things that may be covered by an nda so as such are edited by necessity rather than in any attempt to keep secrets as for the dev blog  a lot of csm people think the same thing as you a list of what has been put forward by them and inserted into the ccp production pipeline would have been extremely nice to show the player base ccp thought it shouldnt a way to do so was discussed fairly intensively at the ccpcsm meeting last nightyesterdayon a more general topic  i agree that the transparency and lack of communication of the csm is a major issue but it is slowly being resolved i expect the next csm session will run a lot more smoothly due to the efforts of the current csm
the next csm will learn from the mistakes of the pasttransparency and discussion will be key to the next csm being a success thats not to say the current csm havent done a good job many issues raised with ccp some of which will shape planning and inform design in the coming yearthere are many players committed to making the csm the success it should be myself included and we take the job of representing player views and issues seriously vote for one of ustake carearithron
not quite the monster truck thread definately got enough thumbs up and as far as im aware was never taken to ccp though i admit i may be wrong but seem to remember csms throwing it out before now im not suggesting for one minuite that this should be in game but it should of been taken to ccp and they should of thrown it out as it starts a precedent for csm overuling the player base that is a chatlog and not minutes minuites are what is in fact posted even though they call them edited minutes minutes by their definition are the important parts picked out of the meeting and i dare say neros nag would have no place on a side note i did notice on the forums the chair refer to one or two of the council members by thier full title and at least another on the same page by a shortened version while may not seem important it could look as a certain favoritism to a member we found this on my local council which im on so we got in the habit of calling other members by thier title in the meetings and this also helped distance any comments made as being more in personal as we knew several of each other in personal life
yeah i dont have much faith in the current csm though i wouldnt have faith in any other csm election eitherpersonally ive always wondered if i could actually be elected if i ran but sadly i dont have enough time on my hands for that kinda thing
high support counts means it automatically makes it onto the csm agenda it does not mean it automatically goes to ccp the monstertrucks issue was put on the agenda because of the high support count and then promptly voted down because its ridiculous and not worth the time in the rare csmccp meetings
the primary function for this csm board was to help define the process and practices of future csm board with a majority of the first times encountered assessed and addressed future csm boards can then properly focus on its elected businessim not a fan of the csm itself nor many on it however with that said im not expecting much from them and im not going out of my way to bother with them either you dont like this process dont partake no sweat off my backnote i imagine somewhere in iceland there is a version of dogbert at ccp offices laughing his head off see we gave them the csm to moan about and look at them waste their energy attacking each other instead of us moronic lemmings never fail you
lets not forget that ccp has very publicly patted themselves on the back for implementing the whole csm conceptit would seem rather foolish for them pr wise to then do anything to tarnish thatso the whole arguement about csm becoming irrelevant would only come from the player base failing to utilize it wisely rather than ccp failing to be responsive to it like any democratic society the real responsibility comes from the voters choose wisely and if you dont get what you wanteddid you realy want it in the first placefood for thought
hey miz thankyou for a highly amusing thread the harsh reality is however that the eve forums are not a good representation of the player base ive run 2 general eve surveys now and each one has clearly shown that the population of eve do not think the same way as forum posters such as yourself the irony is that the csm topics are raised via these forums so any good csm will actually raise additional topics not on the list here through ingame discussions and other information sourcesas for the first csm being a farce its by no means the best functioning csm i hope to see but on the other hand it could have gone significantly worse so while im not able to say im proud of the 1st csms cohesion i am pleased that nothing eve destroying made it to ccp and weve got through a majority of ground work for future csms both as csm operating rules and setting our expectations with ccp
the idea is nice and all but  as usual with ccp  its being turnes into a huge pile of bsjust look at the jerkoff answers given in the csmccp meeting im paraphrasing herecsm skill queue ccp yeah sure we kind of know this has been bugging the hell out of everybody for years on end but hey we kind of like it that way oh sure we will look into itcsm switching all ammo at once ccp yeah well you know this is all difficult and stuff and it might add l a g but sure we will have a talk with the server guys who will totally unexpected concur with our opinion so we can shelve this as well mkaycsm forum softwareccp well you know this really difficult and hard to do too so we will probably just do nothing and continue to ignore the problemcsm 30 day gtcsccp hmm we hear ya  but well wed kind of much rather sell a ton of stupid bs products like mouse mats and key chains because you know having two seperate products it really much too expensvethis all reads to me like ccp is going to throw a few token bones to us yo they can pretend to actually listen to player requests while in realtiy all they are doing is continuing to walk the same old pathall those cannot be changed would be much work would add too much load answers are really driving me up the wallinstead of fixing preformance issues and usability problems they waste time on totally inane pointless garbage like ambulation so they can pretend to be wow in space in the hope to scrape up a few more gormless marketing victimsah well at least writing this made me feel a bit better
agreedambulation  secondlife in space ooooooh wow
actually the ambulation project is worked on by different sections than that of bug fixing and ship balance etcbut it is lame when they say its too hard they shld really say its a long way off or something
im going to propose assigning a certain dev to an issue just like an issue is assigned to a csm then there will be some accountability and the csm that is responsible for the issue can get into contact with a ccp representative to get a status update or add further feedbackis currently working on a document that explains how all of this workswe had a meeting with ccp yesterday and i get the feeling that they agreed with the sentiment that some issues just end up in a blackbox which neither csm nor player has any sight on and that we need some means to give some more transparancy thereonce i have a wiki running for the issues we will likely see some more two way communication as well see this as example
i would dance if devs gave people the ability to switch all turretmissile ammo at once i cant believe this isnt in place yet
ankhesentapemkah good to hear that you are trying to get ccp to commit to a more open processi wish you luck with it 
i got the feeling from the meeting that ccp are trying to be open however theres a limit on how much they can share devs assigned to an area etc already happens as obviously issues are directed at different depts within ccp assigning a dev to an issue and a csm member just complicates things especially if that csm member just shows up for meetings and occupies a slot on the csmfor ease of coordination and fairness open dealings via csmccp meetings is what should remain the mainstay thats not to say more ccpcsm meetings in a csm term arent neededperhaps an update on submitted issue progress could be a requirement at the start of each csmccp meeting or a document that can be posted and accessed by playerstake carebruce hansen
i agree with you neresky and backing you to the hilt maybe one of the csms can clarify this for you i would hope so anywaythats why we voted eh
there is a lot more going on here than neresky can talk about due to eula but tbh ccps actions stink like week old fish in this case
not sure whether i can vote on my own topic or whther the op is counted as a vote  but if not then well here my vote

regulation simply demands more regulation which just gets you going in circles its a bad idea in a marketwhen people stop buying gtcs then the price will drop again or when people start selling more gtcs the price will drop if you have limited supply but increasing demand then of course the price will go up

absolutely i certainly know that reakktor media gmbh developers of neocron and neocron 2 beyond the dome of york allowed under18s to be part of their community teams equivalent to isdaurora allowing their legal parentsguardians to sign the nda on their behalf of course the people were chosen and interviewed to make sure they were mature enough but knowing that one of the better members of that team was 14 well lets just say that age is not a direct correlation to maturity ccp really need to think that one over i was considering applying for the csm this time round but this has left a sour taste in my mouth that has lead me to seriously reconsider an application
i admit bias by being an alternate which excludes me from trips to icelandfanfest and the likehence i get nothing for my time however i see what the csm does behind the scnes and how ccp takes it seriously guess youll have to believe me there no biggee if you dont your point about things being proposed 2 years ago validthing is something is now being done about them due to the csm raising these issues on behalf of players that proposed them in assembly hall etc had there not been a csm are you so sure they would be looked atthe bounty hunter and merc issues that dierdra and i looked at and proposed are an example of something that has been formalised and pushed by the csm entirelyread some minutes that will be posted later this weekyour arguments against the csm will make little difference since the candidacy period is open until the 17th then voting begins there is going to be a second term of the csm and a third etc if you dont think its working run for a spottake carebruce hansen
again your your deliberatly missing the pointlets see if i can simplfy it for youyou expect few csm dealing not only with their own agenda but with constant submissions from the playerbase to look over and think about and with only 6 months to do it in to do more than or even the same as what a large group of people focused on a single issue managed to do in 2 yearsyour impossible expectations are no reason to disband the csmso i again ask you to prove that you have done 110 as much as you expect them to doim not asking if you could have done more than them im not even asking you to do as much as them im asking you to prove you have done one tenth as much as you expect them to have donebut i seriously doubt you are able to becasue that is the very basis of your agrumentative tactics you say a has done more than b and ask b to prove what they have done knowing full well that b will spend so much time defending themselves they will never ask a to prove what exactly they have done its a cheap tactic often used by politicians in public debatesyour own expectations are your own problem not a sympton of the failure of the csmas for being cordial it makes no difference how you say something if what you say is offensive an insult said with a smile is still an insult at least i can say i have been honest when expressing my feelingson the subject of false dilemma  so far you have gone out of your way to paint this discussion as you against the csm it has not worked how you think it should be working and should be scrapped and thus it is you who is trapped within a false dilemmaagain it is you who has attacked the very premise of the csm its operation its results and its supporters and while the entire enterprise is far from perfect it dosnt warrent the vicious attack by you and othersrather than work to make the system better you would rather tear it down completely why is this is it because if it does work if it does get better dosnt that mean that it will more accuratly reflect the opinions and desires of the whole player base rather than a select minority who would rather use the bullying tactics to get what they want while trying to suppress what others want
internet spaceships is serious businessi think imma stay with ccp  microsoft  evil corporation who doesnt care positionthe devs did say something would be done i cant read all possible futures id love future sight but sadly i dont have it so lets go with the devs arent liers optionnot familiar at all with this but devs have constantly spoken on how the system utterly fails honestly is it that much a thing that needs fixing should it get priority over the dozens of other bugged systems perhaps u did get them to move its priority up perhaps theyve had some guy in the basement working on it for a few years and hes getting close so nothing changed i guess ill have to look into itim not saying its not working as it should be i also dont think it should be abolishedmy point is that you guys are puppets and nothing you do will change anything ccp does what ccp does they only change that when there are excessive amounts of whiners whining because mass whining rage quits hurt their profits
not 2 years just 6 months 2 years was just the length of time some of the changes that the csm was claiming credit forim sorry but i dont recall where i said to disband the csm im sorry if i said that i never meant towhat i expected them to do is exactly what they did i gave them 6 months silence their purpose is to take the position of saying no to bad ideas instead of ccp being the ones saying nowell i guess it doesnt matter what i say to you no matter what i say you are going to take offense and i dont wish to do that thusly i will end discourse with you
so you are saying the csm are puppets of ccp yet you admit you arent familiar with issues that the csm puts forward to ccp bugged systems get submitted via the bugs and fixes threads the csm has a mandate to suggest changes for the future direction of eve and these ideas and avenues are proposed via players we see a lot of tweaks and bug issues submitted by the csm as some are irritating and have remained so for a good chunk of time ccp have also taken these onboardthe csm works independantly from ccp i view ccp differently than you i see them as a committed company wanting and striving towards bringing a game for players that is rich in environment opportunities and playabilityand keeps players interested over long periods of time its in their best interests financially to make the game the best they possibly can players play the game its a good idea to let them have an imput into features and the future direction the csm is the conduit that makes this possible it gives the players a voicetake carearithron
you are correct you have never said that the csm should be disbanded i sincerely apologisei have therefore taking offense to a faulty assumption as the csm is pretty much the only real route for individual or small groups of players to contribute to the game no matter how ineffective it is its disbanding would pretty much remove my ability to have my say and that i was finding offensive
look at the threads in this forum regarding each meeting the ones that have been done will have a link to the chatlogs usually on page 3 and usually posted by jadealthough i did enjoy the meeting where i posted the link faster than the guy who put the chatlog online itd be nice if there was a central spot to point you but at present there isnt
the minutes are supposed to be posted in the csm section over there  not sure why it hasnt been updated in a while

ill give you an update we submitted the issue to ccp ccp responded with an answer to the csm we will be discussing that answer with them next weekend 1500 the initial answer  additional notes from the live discussion will be released the following week pending ccp approval of course im not running again in the next election  but seriously its nobodies fault in the current csm that this has taken a long time we did get a provisional answer  we didnt like it that much were going to be asking questions  youll get the skinny when weve had the discussion with ccp next weekend sorry to be blunt but there it is
just went on the sisi and what a disappointment is the naglfar damage is so weak it makes my cry before going to sleep boost this minmatar pride super vertical machine please  and the rest of the min caps too
i dont think this will happen because there are times when the test server could be unavailable for a few hours to a few days depending on the changes being tested it wouldnt really benefit anyone to spend all thier time on the test server since there is no guarentee that it will even be up the next time they go to log ini like the ops idea in that it would make it easier to test out certain game mechanics for new patches hoever i would have to disagree with it because it gives younger players the opporunity to fly ship they otherwise havent earned the right to fly yet in a consequance free environment the thought that a brand new player could log onto sis and then get to experience flying a capital ship after a few minutes as opposed to a veteran who waited years is a little scary plus since sisi is consequence free said pilots would really have no need to learn to fit and fly the ships properly after all who cares its only 100isk the only way i would support this is if they limited sis to pilots with a set number of skillpoints
the test server would have more testing and less people screwing around being irresponsible with large amounts of isk if we could actually use the new features being tested
come on ccp on cms was said this had high priority but there is still nothing on the server test or realso hurry make these ships an bit better
if this happens then citadel torps need an even larger buff than what ccp nozh is suggesting in doing because of smartbombscurrently smartbombs on capital ships emit the blast from the edges of the ship not the center part of the ship that is fine but in reality that gives the same mod large smarty which can be fit to a bc but more realistically a bs a complete range boost by now being on the larger capital shipalthough i would love to see these things get a bit of love as you suggest capital sized smartbombs are not needed and smartbombs being used to take out citadel torps needs to be negatedwill not support this issue as you propose now but i do fundamentally agree they need some love
yeah ultimately if we get enough support and get it through the council thats how its going to be submitted  i just wanted to give enough meat for discussion on this thread  knowing that ccp have the internal talent to do the balancing and numbers for themselves is very useful
oh i quite agree the current citadel torp vs smartbombdefender balance is simply wrong  that needs fixing and if any future smartbomb overhaul increases their damage further than additional citadel tweaks will be needed to keep things reasonable true  perhaps that could be looked at also  rooting the blast at center point of models im not really a fan of the subcapital modules being weapons of choice on the cap ships anyhow  would much prefer an actual capital smartbomb rather than the subcapital bombs auto range boosted by the model size im openminded on the capital smart bombs issue and welcome more debate and pros and cons there you and james make some good points how about if we narrow the effective submission text to a request for a general revamp of smartbombs that includes the skill specialization options rigs and implants and leave the numbers and balancing to the developers
there is already a skill that makes smartbombs refire faster really all it needs is an energy and fitting reduction skills to normalize it with other weapon systems range increases however would be bad overall
regarding the debate over capitals and smartbombs it seems like the two concerns  model size as a range bonus capital ships not needing better sbs  can solve each other make capital smartbombs give them a radius of around 18 km or soso as not to make them kill tacklers when used on a carrierdread and make all smartbombs emanate from the centre of the ships model and not the edges youll ruin the price of officer smartbombs since theyll lose much of their current market but that can be counteracted by a buff now that their supercapital use isnt tying your hands
thats because the csm is a powerless group of power hungry wanabes that has not managed to influence any change whatsoever in its time hinestly check out the dev blog which listed thier influence thus far  its empty lol
any updates about the status of thisthis is in the top of mediumpriority after all greetings belmarduk
absurd  many of us have spent the past 5 years setting alarm clocks etc to switch skills yes i did when i started playing and now the lamer wow newcomers are complaining that its too much hastle for themstfu stop crying for yet another nerf ccp need to grow a pair and just say no
pfff i used to play ascii games you whinerwhy improve when we can go backwards to the good old days
id much prefer a tech ii gas harvestersalvager role orientated frigate but i suppose id settle for a tech ii logistics frigate if that was the only alternative 
why cant we have both
i kind of like the idea but rather than a frigate make the logistics ship a destroyer there are already 5 t2 frigate classes but only 1 t2 destroyer class which has been heavily nerfed and is largely obselete
well in this issue tarminic specifically presented some logistics orientated designs instead im in no way opposed to it id just prefer a utility frigate with an alternative focus if i didnt think it might be a little too overpowered or jack of all trades id suggest roleskill bonuses for gas harvesting salvaging and logistics i still fondly remember the first time i stumbled across the tech ii hull of the bantam in the form of a cosmos agent aboard a sparrow i was so excited then so disappointed
the idea is sweet but i agree about the scaling partcurrent proposal gives you fast locking frigs with a small sig radius so you end up with a slower version of interceptorsand with at least 3 med slots its suited for tackling as wellso i guess the slot layout needs some more attention to make this work as intended
it seems to be par for the course for quite a few csm members whilst i can cope with csm members championing causes they themselves believe in i do also worry when various issues get catapulted to the top of the list when little actual support and a lot of negative opinion has been expressed this thankfully isnt one of them
okay this issue is deferred till next week so some more patience please
yes yes yes yes
i like this idea to an extent we should however be able to form two groups of ammunition to use sometimes people use both missiles and guns sometimes they use different shells in different guns etcwhile this wont drastically reduce lag it will reduce the number of calculations per second the client machine has to perform meaning computers with poor cooling and with lowerend processors should handle combat somewhat smoother sounds like a winwin situation honestly
im not a missile user so not sure how large they are but it seems nonsensical to have them the same size as bullets therefore you might need a gun ammo bay and a missile bay however within that bay you could have as many different types of loads as possible simply right click on each gunlauncher and it lets you select a load for that weapon from a list of what is stored in the appropriate ammo bayalternatively bin the whole bay idea and get the weapons to load direct from cargo with a minor tweak upwards in cargo size to compensate for storing ammo there rather than in the weaponim not a programmer or mathematician but wouldnt that also benefit lag hits when changing ammo even as suggested on other threads to change ammo in all guns at the same time  since the operation is a pointing one rather than a moving things around one
while i completely agree with the op there is another issuefor ccp solving reload problem in fleet battles will be like shooting itself in the footwhats happening if you fly a nonamarr ship well when your clip is empty eventualy and since you almost never reload we have one less ship creating lagpoor tempest can you believe it can be even worse considering reloadim wondering what would happend if everybody would fly only amarr in fleet battles amarr nerf maybe at least thats my choice having to choose between my server and some whiningits fair for nonamarr hell no but whats fair in life and eve
21 why why not 18  in support of lv future candidacy
supported  though id like to see reexamination of docking games and other issues where bumping has become the default as to why thats the case and whats broken about it that they have to bump in the first place if anything
bumping seems a little metagamy for my taste would like to see this done away with
definatly agree with this one makes no sense whatsoever for a tiny ship to pput a much larger vessel of course by flying at them
supported but please dont swing the nerf bat too hard
taxits ok not wanting to pvp and staying in the npc corps to be protected from it but there should be a drawback to balance things outnpc corp pilots interact with each other run missions together mine so on they have the multi player part sorted nice big channel of people talking  sharing information having funedit plus this would be a very good isk sink
actually im going put a different take on the title of this issue and say that im all in favour of purely solo players in npc corps being taxed now as soon as the op and proponents identify a way to spot a purely solo player we can talk again i propose that the tax is cancelled the moment they have fleeted with someone else problem solved they have learned to interact with othersyoure about two months too late fleeting with someone can no longer be scammed concord rules apply as though you werent fleeted besides i gang with random people all the time its called factional warfare oddly enough i dont need to be in a player corp to have fun and pvp
epic  topichmm to get that straight what kind of guys do we have in npc corp and how would they be affected by taxes new players of course if we had a dynamic tax like 0 for the first 12 months then they obviously wont be affected the time beeing a new player i see no problem here all time high sec solo mission runners would be affected and maybe some would make their own corp or join player corpally once a specific tax rate has been reached perfect all time solo minerstradersindustrialists wouldnt be affected somehow unfair to mission runnersratters but this problem applies to player corps as well so maybe you start another thread on this issue sometime  griefer ganker scammer any scouttrade alts  wouldnt be affected muchso the only problem group affected would be mission runners and mission runner alts right well its a start but as long as market transactions are not included its just a drop in the ocean this beeing said taxation of market transactions would be a fair deal in general to balance taxes for industrialiststraders and missionrunnersrattersconclusiontaxes for npc corps wouldnt change too much and only punish mission runners but the reason is that we would still have a missing tax on transactions as this general problem applies to player corps as well i see no reason why npc corps should be an exception support granted
hi let me summarize the ops problem as he describes it and then demonstrate that he himself is the problem1ops problem not being able to recruit players from npc corps2ops felt problem lack of tax on npc corps and npc corps being safe haven from wardecs3ops proposed solution tax players in npc corps4expected result 1 more players play together5expected result 2 additional isk sink lets analyze this point by point and i know that i will be repeating what some people already said1 imagine 3 players abca is ceo of a 1 man corp and wants a corpmateb is ceo of a 1 man corp and wants a corpmatec is in an npc corp and doesnt want to leave itnow a and b want ccp to tax c so he joins either a or bif ccp does tax c there are following possibilities c pays tax leaving ab and c unhappy c quits eve leaving a and b unhappy and c badmouthing eve c creates his own corp leaving a and b unhappy c joins either a or b probably the one with the lowest tax leaving either b or a unhappy and c wishing he had created his own corp instead wouldnt the best solution be a and b merging corps and c untaxed in his npc corp my point is recruit people with similar goals dont force others to adopt yours merge with others and put an end to 1 man corps rather then upsetting the communities which build in npc corps yes communities in npc corps do exist2 what are taxes used for  to pay office rents and finance a goal common to the pilots in the corp the money a member pays doesnt vanish the money returns to him in the form of a corp hangar maybe free ammo maybe a pos in 00  you name it if the money in your corp just vanishes i would suggest you leave that corp asap so why should npc corp members pay a tax that would be a deliberate amount and a pure isk sink as the op put it himself i see no reason oh sure you cant be wardecced  but then you cant wardec either but you can still fly to 00 and shoot everyone vice versa a 00 corp gives a damn about wardecs they live under constant threat so arent the highsec player corps actually hypocritical they live in peace unless someone decides to wardec them there is zero danger of losing a ship during peace and a war costs the declaring party isk shouldnt all empire corps pay a tax when they are not at war to compensate for the lower risk compared to 00 3 compare point 1 the ops inability to recruit likeminded players understanding the need for a tax in return of insert free items  service here can only be solved by taxing players which do think differently then the op yeah right you may lol here  4 the op expects more players playing together he didnt say wether he meant cooperatively or adversely though actually it doesnt matter because in both cases you need players willing to join a player corp willing to work towards a common goal but not necessarily on the same side the soldier in northcorea does the same job as the soldier in southcorea neither of them is a oneman army but they dont fight on the same side so i assume its more a question of numbers let me depict the ops logic with an analogy counterstrike is a popular fps game which can very well be played 1 vs 1 but its more fun when there are more players on the server because the tactics and teamwork get more significant now the op sits on a server with only 1 opponent but wished both teams had more players now what to do  oh yes of course  he logs onto the wow forums and starts a topic why pay to play if you could play css for free join ip xxxxx wouldnt it be more logical to search other css servers with more players i have a hunch they like playing css at least a bit i ran out of space  edit spelling mistakes
5 i may be dumb  i am  but what does an additional isk sink have to do with the type of corporation a player joins or is it the tax rate maybe security status no  faction standings no  gah  i give up  im not mathematically inclined last but not least demonstrating that the op is part of the problem and not part of the solution you may all hate me  later first readimagine 4000 warriors aching for a good fight imagine them in following situations1 they all are in the same corp 4000 unhappy warriors no ennemies at hand2 they are split evenly across 2 warring factions 4000 happy soldiers 2000 in each camp3 they are all split evenly across 4000 warring factions 4000 angry posters protesting that their 1 man faction has not enough warriors because all the carebears decided not to pay taxes and also avoid war do i have to get more explicit edit forgot to add awe and respect for people coming up with very good points and reasoning i am aware that my post recycles some of what has been said additional considerations a ccp markets eve as a sandboxtype game with a player driven economy sandbox means everyone is free to do what he wants to do  even being pressured by other players ingame ccp just provides the sandbox player driven economy means the economy  mining salvaging researching inventing manufacturing selling are part of the game w00t its not all about pvpb ccp actively helps soloplayers power of 2 c mmo  massively multiplayer onlinegame as stated by previous poster that is massively multiplayer a lot  or even more in the case of tranquility onlinegame it uses da interwebs somehow  no clue how looks at router with that boxok that means many players interacting world of warcraft guildwars project entropia  are all considered mmos  heck you could even add second life to that list and that one has a lot of pvp actually i even consider the radiomoderators and lottery organizers part of the community sometimes annoying thoughd ambulation may even attract more stationhuggers that is if ccp adds hugging to the possible gestures and  no support
nice to see you so aptly demonstrate your own qualities for employment ie none  perhaps you should read threads like this before mouthing off about someone this sets aside the fact that youre talking rubbish  nobody has said eve is bad because you can pvp
  skill requirement for capital mining laseropinions 
sounds like an awesome idea to me my alt would still fly a freighter when needed but this gives more fun options and avoids some risks of losing such a huge investment
well i acknowledge that it provides ccp with a legitimate appearing mechanism for removing csm members obviously as things stand now theyre able to can anyone at any time for any reason anyway while probably the only concern for them being the potential fallout for being seen doing it to a csm after they lauded the whole thing in their public relations material at least this kind of thing would give them something to point at in justification to the community i supposewhile i dont entirely think ccp are the kind of people to rock up blackbag someone and drive off with them into the dark of night never to be seen again without good reason i am a little uncomfortable about the idea that a csm member banned from the forums is automatically kicked from the csm no offence meant to the forum moderators but since anything worth a ban is usually deleted from a post it doesnt seem very accountable to well uswhile i figure a certain degree of good conduct is required ive never expected any elected official to be an angel on the other hand anything they could post worth a ban would probablyusually incline me to be happy that theyre gone but this wont always be the casei cant help but worry that this just mandates the potential for abuse
forum ban  noingame ban  yesyou can get banned from the forums very easily i have seen people get forum bans for less than what csm members have posted
gets my vote
supported if its not already the case yes theres an issue about whether they were justly banned but then youre into did ccp do the right thing territory and given that 99999 of the discussions in the entire set of forum constitute that in one form or another
there is no way in hell that a forum moderator should have final say on who cancannot be a member of the csmif you get banned ingame then yes i could see a reason for removal from csm but being temporaryily banned from this forum should not result in removal from the csm especially with the inconsistencies of recent forum bannings darius banned for trolling but jade not for doing the same thing is just one example i can think of
im unhappy with some appearances of the csm on the forums but i have mixed feelings with being booted from the csm for a forum ban im more for an investigation if that happens and the ccp people behind the csm scolding the csm in violation and deciding on action rather than a forum ban resulting in removal 100 of the timeafter all if this goes through people can be provoked by alts or throwaway accounts on purpose and it will likely result in a lot more trolling and harrassment of csm on the forums to get them to lose their temper and get themselves banned
you are kidding right ever heard of conflict of interestif a csm member is banned from the gameforums the csm itself should decide among themselves about the fate of their fellow member
who got bbet it was a goon
well id agree there could certainly be some kind of behind the scenes discussion going on  but ultimately if you are getting forum banned under the new enlightened forum regime weve got now then something is going wrong ank people do get sent emails from the moderators telling them when theyve had posts removedmovedwhatnot and why and if they keep insulting other players then its really their own faultwell to be quite honest i very much doubt any csm present or future is going to get as badly trolled and insulted and flamed and stalked than ive been this summer and at the end of it all ive still got my posting rights and managed to avoid breaking forum rules handling csm business in the midst of some extremely ugly discussions ive had literally hundreds of forum alts trolling me and the ultimate answer is simply to install caodcleaner and block entire organizations and alt posters if you really cant handle these people with an even temper on eve online ive found it hugely liberating to be able to say what i really think on shc from time to time mind you 
ban from the game or a ban from the forums the proposal also included forum bans wasnt jade banned from the forums at one point prior before sitting on the csm a ban from the game i would agree but not a ban from the forums to get banned from the game you had to violate the eula banning from the forums means that you were being an over emo troll
definitely agree
personally if you get banned from the forums you should get banned from the game and vice versa as theres no real reason to be one or the other without the otheras far as the csm goes the csm should be responsible for itself but i have no idea what sort of system they have running but its a bit painfully obvious that anyone who gets banned from either orshould quickly be removed from the csm provided its a just causesemisupportps anything can be viewed as a potential serious abuse in power welcome to paranoia
yes
i was going to vote against this because it can be easily abused but then thats a good reason to vote for it
agreed just basic common sense
no not kidding yes ive heard of conflict of interesti agree that the csm itself should decide the fate of their fellow member however this is problematic as it means a faction in power can totally kickout all other votes in csmmembersso based on the comments so far ill revise the ejection process like thisforum banning gives the csm members the right to vote on whether the forum banned csm member is kicked from the csm one vote may be taken per forum banning
yes
signed
so who got banned
i still dont really like it but thats much less bad
depending on the csm member and what alliance if any they are in ejection via csm candidate votes could be just as bada forum ban could be looked at by ccp not forum admin first the csm informed and some reasoning given ie serious breachnot serious breach the csm could then vote ccp be informed of the wishes of the csm and ultimately someone in ccp to take responsibility for a final decisiona forum ban would entail some warnings first plus the csm member would not be able to interact with players via the forum which id say is a pretty important duty if csm members are aware of the consequences of actions beforehand then choose to act in unprofessional ways id say they had fair warningtake carearithron
upon reflection and in danger of opening another can of wormswhat about removal of a csm member by vote for dereliction of dutythe definition of duty could be decided a commitment agreement by csm members at the start of a csm termtake carearithron
is any one else sensing a witch hunt is a foot getting support to take to ccp to go after someone currently on the csm i thought there was some kind of movement already to oust jade for some things that everyone had heart burn abouthad a lot of support and ccp said nopewell if this is a last poke in the eye of whoever it is on the boardi am going to need popcorn for thisplease visit your user settings to reenable images
ofc this should be the case if they are unable to conduct themselves in a proper manner ingame or on the forums then they have no place on the csmor perhaps you believe that ccp allows any old muppet to be a forum mod and furthermore allows said muppets to ban anyone for no reason
heck yes
as far as i know nobody on the csm is forum banned at the moment i dont think its so much a witch hunt as just trying to set up some solid rules of conduct for the people going into a second term and being joined by the new intake as for people going after me  bah that was just trolling nobody sensible took that to heart  certainly not ccp or the csm
for myself i just cant seem to conect the ingame stuff to the forum stuff forum stuff your really not logged in whilst in game i see and feel a completley different manner a play and behavior that when i get my role on so to speakhereits like having a beer with the fellas and talking about how much you suck ingame or talk about how we can fix this or that and tell funny stories of  poor fittings and scammsbut i guess most just cant seem to sperate themselves from ingame and out
bit different for a csm delegate though you do need to use the forums to communicate with the players and you cant afford to use them lightly  ultimately its a medium for discussion and has to be treated with respect
jade  changing the way eve sovereignty works is an interesting proposal toward helping to reduce the reliance of power blocs and alliances on massive fleets and decrease blob warfare thus reducing lag however that defeats the purpose of this topic which is quite plainly  give us massive fleet battles that dont lag  periodperhaps there needs to be two additional components added to sovereignty that takes into account the amount of days a friendly and hostile force has actively occupied a system or area of space called  residency and occupationthese would be composite scores based on the number of active pilots over time excluding afk campers in a system that would determine a weighted average of a suite of bonuses that would discourage blobs or enable more distributed warfare these bonuses would need to target antiblob mechanisms such as bombs dds etc perhaps a new miniature dd needs to be developed to take advantage of this properlygrid loads through star gatesjump bridges and jump portals have always been troublesome and allowed the upper hand to the force already occupying the field if an option was added to allow inbound jumping fleets to distribute randomly into other grids in the system and then coordinate a rally point from there it would reduce the node strain arising from massive gate camps and breaking forces this would definitely make warfare more mobile and fast paced as it would rely on more probing and system scouting to locate the opposing forcesspamming gates with fighters is also a contributing factor to gate grid loads  there needs to be something added to discourage fighter spamming under selected circumstances where the node is under severe loads or at least allow a fleet to properly counter a fighter heavy force with tactics or weaponry
i like
no
my understanding is that larger limits can cause strain on the databasewhilst the ingame mail length can be a problem the max length for forum posts should be sufficient for most purposes  if you really understand the point that you want to make you shouldnt have any difficulty making it concisely
bah you just hate long posts you damned amarrian zealotbut seriously  the forum post issue will get resolved at the point that ccp overhaul the forum software theres no real point us promoting or advocating improve forumz issues because ccp know there is a problem know what they have to do have scheduled improvements in the coming year and its just a matter of waiting and seeing there on the issue of concise point making  well as a fan of impassioned rhetoric im obviously going to disagree with you but there are some kinds of posts it would be nice to have in single inputs  war diaries stories ic pieces recognition threads resource lists etc etc so lets not tldr ideological purity blind us to practical advantage there
its text even without compression assuming a million evemails a day are sentwhich there arent making them all 3x as long as the current limitwhich they wont be will add about a gig of data a gig of storage space at current prices costs about a quarter for the home user and presumably a fair bit less when you buy hard drives by the hundred or thousand the gig of bandwidth to transfer that data costs the home user about another quarter and ccp certainly gets a better deal on that than you or i so even for me personally to hold and serve the data will cost about 15month and for ccp its probably more like 10month in other words a single additional subscription even at annual rates as for forum posts while this is sort of a moot point because its getting fixed anyone who can say it in 4000 characters probably still will  most people dont like typing all that much for those who dolike say me and jade theyll split it into multiple posts when needed anyways which doesnt save space at all all youll do is get rid of those absurd reserved posts that the current system requires
i only support this for eve mail and bioforum post of chat post are totally fine with me
the reason why players are willing to tolerate risk is for reward the reward in absolute terms does not matter however  it is the reward compared to other options that matters the rate that is most important for this calculation is the riskfree rate of return  the best interest you can make without exposing your money to any plausible risk in the real world this is generally taken to be a us treasury bill and in eve its your walletsince the lack of forwardlooking contract enforcement prevents any investment from sanely being called riskfree investments are then compared based on their reward over the baseline visavis their risk thus a canadian government bond with next to no risk needs to offer next to no risk premium whereas a zimbabwean government bond needs to offer a gargantuan risk premium to make it worth investing in it given the risk of default eve finance works in a similar fashion investments range from lowrisk sources of cash flowdatacorefarmer characters bpos to mediumriskreputable businesses looking for investment to highriskthings you expect to be a scam at each level you demand a higher return for obvious reasons what your proposal would do is to completely throw off the riskreward ratio for the game you would destroy the value of longterm investments because why would you invest in a t2 bpo to earn 6 per month if everything stays stable when you can just sit your money in stock and earn 5 per month a lot of people who invested into datacore standings or into invention skills and interfaces or into bpos or into anything similar are having their entire investment strategy undercut because youre upping the riskfree rate of return and thus making their risky rates of return almost laughable as such you will destroy the value of these investments  youll have effects on the character market on the blueprint market and on all forms of playerdriven investment ranging from ipos to deposit banks also your proposal goes against the grain of mmo design the player gets nothing for free at least not when it comes to assets you want money you need to go earn it you can earn it by good oldfashioned murdering people and robbing their corpses or by doing something productive  producing trading providing a service or investing in those who do one of the former you do not under any circumstance get to put your money into a black box called free cash and have a developer assurance that it will in fact spit out free cash with no further effort on your part also your rate of 1 per hour is astoundingly high it doubles your money wvery three days with reinvestment or every four without reinvestment even at the rate you seem to have meant 01 per hour you double your money in 694 hours or st under a month nothing in game at present pays out at that rate or anything even close for comparison t2 bpos are priced for about 5 return per month and those require fuel costs for the pos and a lot of effort moving things around to keep them fueled if this system were implemented anything above 23 per month would be far too high i disagree with it on principle even if the rate were that low but i want to make sure that you at least have a sense of reality when it comes to what sort of rates we would see
no we already have enough risk free isk faucets in game thanks
ok no worries thanks for the input guys it was just an idea i was throwing out there 
so we agree on 3 issues then1  the csm cannot action anything and is therefore a redundant process if they cannot action anything and the dev blog in which thier achievements was listed was essentialy empty it is somewhat of a waste of time2  despite the fact that in many threads the csm claim that they do not have time to cover many issues in your own words they waste time on a whole bunch of irrelevant side chatter3  the lack of transparency forthcoming from the csm is a major issueglad we see eye to eye on that then
its an advisory council for players to give advice to ccp  not sure what else you expected the achievements for this csm will be a setting up the process b making it work c promoting issues which will influence and prioritize game development cycles if you want a quick win its not going to happen devs dont snap their fingers and implement fully prototyped and tested game alterations in 5 months flat  just doesnt work like that youll see the ingame effects of the first csms advocacy beginning to happen next year by which point some of us wont be in offense any more ive certainly had the time to cover and advocate every issue ive considered to be important in this first term i think most of the other csms will be able to say the same ultimately weve debated and advocated a whole slew of issues and got some real progress on influencing the future development path for the game sure there are some disappointments  ill cover some of mine in my final assessment posts at the end of the term  but there have been some good accomplishments and end of the day im pretty happy with the performance of a good number of the csm delegates and alternates who have aided the processpublic chatlogs of our meetings minutes from the csmccp discussions public thread advocacy hell ive even had chatlogs from private channels and 3rd party forums brought up as smear and scandal material i think its been pretty transparent and ultimately im going to be posting a summary of my activities on the csm as i leave office listing all the issues i promoted and why and a full voting record all the meetings i chaired will be on the public record as chatlogs and ill be extremely open about what i think worked and what didnt work in this inaugural session
applaudsthumbs upwe need more people like him
bump
the policy is very logical it discourages blobbing past the limits of server performanceif this policy was reversed it would leave the game open to more harmful abuse where the largest blocks in the game could potentially field node breaking fleets without risk
it surprising how bobpets pilots constantly act like theyve never been on the laggy losing side of a grid load or crashing node perhaps its because they havent been the hubris and sheer volume of posts of bobpets toward declaring the current game mechanics and clientserver performance are more than adequate is also surprising perhaps its because the lag and crashes never seem to quite effect them
no i just dont waste my time trying to blame everyone else for my actions
right now there are some very odd things going on in pos management one of the things that we discovered in our corp and no one seems to be able to find a way around is that if you have any corp array access other than just viewing you also have some very powerful rights management as regards the pos itselfthis is not good the purpose of a corp array is at least in our corp to be able to pick up and drop stuff off as needed for other corp members that might be ore ammo items for invention or manufacturing etc i frequently drop missiles that i pick up as loot for those using caldari ships for instance because i dont use very many if any on my shipsrather than role management each with overbroad powers it would be good to see something less granular  more similar to what you can do with corp hangars in stations where you have offices for instance in this way you could give a new corp member access to the array so they could take out ammo etc without giving them the ability to change the password shut down the forcefield or unanchor the thingplease csm could you examine this issue and see about bringing it up to ccp we have filed a petition on it but i believe that is unlikely to do more than wind up as a note someplacethanks
this seems like pretty fundamental stuff i wonder why its not in place now
yeah i think this should apply to corp management periodnot an easy task howeverbut it should have a more comprehensive permissions systemmuch like a common enterprise business networkfile server
thx but i dont need for that  
just as in rl a very small part of the eve population actually voted when they where asked to do so could be explained by not knowing what to expect from the csm and by lack of time to read up all which was proposed during campaigns currently i see the csm as a form of filter helping ccp to sift through the huge number of postings on this site the csm helps finding the rare gems and prepolishes them but ccp decides which ones they actually cut and put on display after all they own the shop they run the financial riskthe csm members seem very dedicated to me  good job concerning ambulation as long as game magazines playtest eve for 1 day 2 if ccp gets lucky and end their review with eve has nice graphics but your avatar is only a picture 3232 pixels  that long ccp needs ambulation to keep up with other mmos and yeah i dont think very much of mmos featuring 3d avatars which swing their weapon once every 5 seconds with floating numbers above the head of opponents to indicate a hit ah well  at least you can dance in those mmosbut i think ccp promised to add useful features to ambulation i hope they add the macarena
yet another slam the csm postgbtwow o p
i suggest you read my post again i havent said a single bad word about the csm itself neither outspoken nor impliedall i was trying to say is that ccp at least from my point of view doesnt seem to take this csm process very seriouslyyeah yeah bite me just for the record i never have played nor will i ever play wow
i agree with the opthe responss to the csm from ccp are donkey  carrot and the council members buy into itthe whole csm fiasco has been a joke  its members included
yup there have have been a lot of these threads latley  wonder whygot the message yet ccp csm 
assembly hall is not for ranting
lockedrant
manufacting  accept quote window  could you make it a bit bigger or scaleable to view all required minerals in the same time without scrolling
as ever im giving a thumbsup to a ui issue
when can we expect to hear the results of this meeting
i believe results of the first half should be due sometime this week pending ccp approval of the summary
i for one welcome the second season of csm just imagine all the drama that will ensue
the ancient greek form of democracy where it originated was indeed like that  but the definition of demos the people was pretty narrow it did not include women slaves foreigners mad people in fact to a greater or lesser degree it basically covered individuals conforming to points 1 through 6 in your post the modern form of democracy may have widened the definition of demos but it is probably more appealing to and more open to corruption by selfserving individuals than many other forms of government
the insane still cant vote and the only country i know of that allows even nominal foreigners to vote is the united kingdom where apparently they consider resident colonials to not really be foreigners also id wager that you wont find any slaves voting in the present day either as for the susceptibility to the selfserving i disagree entirely power corrupts famously but power attracts the corrupt just as well and it always has whether youre a flatterer in the royal court a warlord conquering for personal gloryread ale and women an intriguing noble or any of the thousand other varieties of corrupt powerseekers in history including lying politicians youre going to find a way to seek power the difference is a lying politician can screw you over less with it because you can vote him out again in a few years
depends on your definition of insanityanyone and everyone votes in this day and age the standards of whats considered foreignand insane are not where you think they areand voting them out in a few years is a few years too many
insanity is defined far more narrowly these days than in years past but if youre involuntarily institutionalized for mental illness say im pretty sure you dont get to votealthough i havent looked into it so its possible that somewhere a legislature themselves in need of involuntary institutionalization has extended the right to those people foreign i define as not a citizen using whatever the legal definition of citizenship is locally and as i said im pretty sure its only the uk that allows noncitizens to vote and even then theyre not really foreigners in the same sense being subjects of her majesty resident in the uk as for it being a few years too many sometimes it really can bewhich is why im a huge proponent of recall legislation in real life but id rather live under a bad elected leader for a few years than a bad unelected leader for his lifetime say what i will about someone like jimmy carter id take him over a castro kim  mugabe or their ilk any day of the weekedit seriously i cant use the name of the recentlyhanged iraqi dictator i can understand the german one given the ubiquity that led to godwins law but sh was a piker compared to uncensored stalin or mao
all these activities look pretty foolish to me but at least with the first one you can have some good time
way back when this csm stuff was first talked about the idea was that popular ideas would get put through via the csm lately im seeing a lot of i support this putting on the agenda for next meeting by current csm members on issues that dont have that much support or worse appear to have quite a vocal opposition which cannot be quantified thanks to this forum lacking a proper polli just wanted to ask what peoples views were should the current and future csm members be championing causes or acting as an interface for the community or bothto me its tough whichever way you cut it  in an ideal world you voted for the right people so they should champion your causes  but eve is big and diverse enough that this may not be true id be happy with causes if they were at a lower priority than obviously popular issuesequally i suppose you could argue that since all the csm can do is suggest it doesnt matter we have ccp as final arbiter of whether idea x is a good idea or not but that comes off as very cynical
thats a really hard question the problem is that theres just some issues which are extremely controversial but where the general public has a misconception about the actual problem an example is the people who want t2 bpos removedpeople thinks that t2 bpos are still a bad thing for eve though this is certainly not the casei hate to sound elitist but some issues are not simple enough that we can agree on them nor can we all be right somebody has to be right and ccp must be that entity who decides on who this is some issues are also not very mainstream yet they are damn important for eve as a whole an example is the economics issues which i have been advocating and will continue to do so a very small minority cares about these but do realize that are just as important as 00 mission and lowsec issues
i mostly fall to the edmund burke position on this one  we elect representatives for their judgment not for their ability to slavishly follow the whims of their constituents as long as representatives are honest in their campaigns people should basically know what theyll be getting when they cast their vote  lvv does economic issues ank does carebear stuff jade tries to overhaul 00 and so on there always needs to be checks and balances like the automatic escalation of an issue with a certain support levelcurrently 2800 votes and the short terms of office that also increase accountability but overall i will largely leave the choice of issues up to the representatives following the general positions laid out in their election campaigns they should consider public levels of support and opposition but its only one factor after all if support was the only metric why bother having an election
vague labels such as carebear stuff need a little more definition empire activities are vast and complex in their interactions the term economic covers a vast multitude of areas one could argue that anything connected with isk is economic for examplehaving experience of particular spheres of game play might make a candidate a bit more knowledgeable in that sphere but it doesnt make such a candidate an expert or any more qualified to deal with issues in that sphere than other candidateshowever it might mean that issues seemingly picked from random from the jita threads for agendas actually are issues that interest particular candidatespersonally i look for issues that show a degree of thought define an issue well and qualify as affecting the majority of players and making eve a better gaming environment i dont think it follows that id need vast experience of the sphere the issue stems from i just need an open mind ability to see outside the box and the ability to weigh up the pros and cons before making a decision maybe this is what you mean by electing for their judgmentits clear to me that ccp want ideas for the future development of the game players neednt get bogged down in the finer details at times csm members also get into conflict with the finer details the ability to stay objective should be a mainstay for any candidatetake carearithron
i was vague with how i referred to their topics of preference but if you look through the past csm agendas and the topics that they have created personally their opinions and styles are pretty obvious it was only intended for illustration though so a bit of a lack of specificity is tolerable imo my point was that the nature of the electoral system tends to lead to very factionalized representation the goons vote for a goon the bears vote for a bear the industrialists vote for an industrialist and so on  not always but pretty often fortunately a lot of the issues are similarly factionalized  most nonindustrialists dont need to care about whether components are used in production or not  and so representing the assorted groups leads to most of the niche issues getting checked off and the broader issueslag forums etc will be raised by just about any of the reps its certainly worthwhile to have generalists on the council but the voting system tends to skew it more towards specialists and theres nothing wrong with having a few of them too as for my comment about electing people for their judgment the point burkeand by quotation i was trying to make was that representative democracy is not direct democracy you do not elect a representative for the sole purpose of listening to his constituents and doing what they demand on any given issue at any given time you run to represent them by using your own judgment not to parrot them this is why election platforms matter  if we were just electing avatars trust would be the only factor since we are electing councillors their opinions matter more than ours  you elect somebody who you believe will represent your own methods of thought and take care of the things you want taken care of not merely somebody who will follow the mob incidentally this is why honesty matters so much in politics  anybody who says they think like x and then acts like y is being elected on a fraudulent basis and since those claims are all the voters can judge based on they are diminishing the quality of the voters representation by their deceptions
i attribute the low population of 00 most of the time to the fact that you only need a high population for that duration that a meaningful fight is going on thats 00 for the most part nobody a random scout or nano some gatecampers and then huge blobs the rare midsized roam and finding two of them in the same area is incredibly improbable were talking about nonnano pvp right theres nothing in the gap between the lone nanos and the large blobs when it comes to targets so there are no attackers or calls for defense at those engagement sizes you can size up the enemy and determine if they can hit a pos and instantly know whether to log or go defend a posother than that participation is very voluntary with a little luck and a lot of watching local and maybe both its really hard to get ganked in 00 in your own system for countering roaming attackers this means its possible to simply let the tide go back outbasically what im saying is that the reason why it seems like 00 is either rapiers at chokepoints or blobs smashing towers is because theres nothing in between to demand anything else and 00 lifestyle has evolved into a culture driven by that fact if there was an intermediate facility between naked space and the pos there would be intermediatesized objectives and medium sized responsesyoure not just asking about why people use nanos right thats tactical midsized gangs can go roam and do some decent havoc when they catch the right targets flatfooted but they have a harder time forcing engagements and a much harder time getting out of bad ones nanos offer both those advantages and thats their sexyat the point of rambling more granular sources of attention would lead to more granular tactics of harassment to draw more granular responses in less blobbable environments this would work in favor of the small gang who could then pick an objective appropriate to their goals and shape the size of the response at current the targets are pretty binary and so are the responsesat least thats what was on my fortune cookie at lee po house of soy
i think there should be objectives for small gangs so it can be profitable to have a quick and disciplined raid against a larger foe large fleets also take a longer time to assemble and to respond by the time the small gang of raiders should already have had a chance to escapelarge groups should patrol their space and small groups should be able to sneak behind enemy lines and cause actual damage and get some nice booty in the processive supported issues regarding these problems in this csm and it is absolutely something i want to put more effort in in the next csm incarnation
this is a great idea
definitely is and one of the big reasons i hope ank gets reelected for the 2nd term
with the advent of small anchorable structures coming these might just be the ticket small gangs are looking for to utilise 00 space essentially what is really missing is a true covert opsblack ops that can sneak down pipes and setup requisite jump points for a small gang to jump to from empirethat would create a bit of fun and mayhem behind the lines of course the small gang would still need to get backalternately look at the pipes which present natural chokeeasily defendable points to prevent access to 00 space making it easier to jump into 00 space could be one possibilityyou have to define the goals of small player gangs a little moreare they for pvp in 00 against alliances etc annoying to alliances but no longer term damage doneorare they for quick miningspawnexploration runs quick iskmaking ventures with riskorare they smallscale war groups sent by other alliances to testdestroyharass the local sov holders and alliesperspective is everything depending on what goals you have your envisioned solutions might be different and end results wanted i included other possible goals and probably missed some as i see any solution as having to be suitable for any small gang regardless of goal im for the ability to loot and pillagelightning strikes quick getaway nothing permanent done that cant be fixed with a bit of isk and tenderloving care black ops gangsid listen to any sensible idea though on the matter im of the opinion that it could be something that ccp could look at to enrich this style of gameplay thoughtake carearithron
use more lotion small gang targets is kind of a landmine to some peoplei just had a fairly promising what if that goes like thiswhat if the route to being a permanent 00 power went like this1 you can build standalone selfconstructing facilities that produce the backbone income of 00 but require production facilities in highsov systems in order to process into space bling they are more vulnerable but with low risk income is transient if you cant defend anything but flows quickly if you can win some quick battles2 once you get your stations etc and get some high sov systems with planetary control going on the basis of fahtims 00 thread a few pages down you can build the high society structures that eat production from the initial structures in order to build spacebling this is the backbone of turning the young emperors into space pimps who are middle men for space bling3 once you get enough constellation sov and other cool stuff you can build research facilities that crank out bpcs for really nice space bling at this point its a true player empirein short give upandcoming players into 00 a fast route to access but make it transient and unstable as well as tethering it to the production means of larger alliances just as players are tethered to empire for npc fuel etcthis might be the key to getting a more granular system that the large alliances wont throw a fit at their empires will be constantly eroding and they will be losing raw materials but if those materials have to go through them the overall power landscape still moves relatively slowthe granular structures become the subject of midsized gang warfare while the alliances duke it out over the toplevel production facilities and research capacity etc 00 is more accessible and more meaningful in the same strokeeveryone wins
no opinions are correct all they are is opinions and yours are no better than anyone elses regardless of what you and the majority may think there is nothing inherently wrong with racism or dislikes toward sexual preferences its simply what society has taught you i challenge anyone who cares to logically explain why it is wrong you can start off by explaining why damaging other peoples liveswhich is arguably what this type of hate does is wrong when you as a business owner or employee make your living by increasing or maintaining high sales at the expense of others reduction in those areas thus damaging their lives a position you wouldnt want to be in yourself if we want a world where our own opinion is heard rather than repressed every other opinion must be accepted regardless of how disgusting you find it to be that is my opinionthat said i recognize theres a paradox here namely that i must accept that some people want censorship despite the foolishness i find it to be ccp is running a business and have made your version of bigotry a punishable offense in their game at least on paper i reckon you may get your opinion through if you complain loud enoughrock on
well  still waiting  hope a csm could atleast comment on whats going on with this issue before the new csm class rolls in thanks
next weekend when the 11th and 12th or the 18th and 19th that way i will be here shortly after to hear my answers because from what you have said ccp does not appear to be too enthused about doing this unless i have misinterpreted what you have written which i think i have not in any event whatever the news keep us updated we can start a threadnought later  worked for goons didnt it
i see no downside i even think you should be able to set your skills like you can in eft so you can test anything with any skillset in realtime rather than numbers of eft
supported
thumbs up for thumbs down
be quiet yourself  i strongly disagree with youi have just noticed that the skillqueue has disapeared from the drawingboard and is neither in development or under testingwhat does this mean now has it been rejected by ccp or what ccp said they would look into it and are thinking about either a dualtraining system or a 1skillqueuecould we please have an official statement about the status greetings belmarduk
while i agree with this idea in principle i wondering if there would be any issues with rapid firing weapon systems such as auto cannonsanother area which also needs to be looked out at either an alternative or additional changes is weapons systems need to groupa typical fleet fit tempest has 6 1400mm all firing the same ammothere is no reason why we couldnt just have the ui group all the guns together fire once and have a multiplier applied to the damage dependent on how many guns you have grouped
the helllvs the last guy they should be keeping out of csm esp with the upcoming midas patchsupported
edit
make bumping take a ships mass into account thats all you needfrigates going 10k ramming battleships 5km at 1000ms is stupidthe battleship should move about 50m at about 10ms while the frig rebounds off
yes the mass of the ships should be taken into considerationit is stupid that you can bump a titan with a shuttle
fine have it realign the you part of your statement and not the other ship if you fly your ship towards someone like that it either needs to take collison damage or your ship needs to be bounced away and not the other shipi have seen a tiny frigate fly up fast to a titan and make the titan bounce off it at hundreds of km a second or morethere is no skill involved and the reason ccp has said it is not an exploit is because they know it is a ton of work to rework it im not saying make it realistic im saying make it make sense
i have proposed this idea in my commercial jumpdrives and cynos ideayou should check it outkaiden
isk sink as a reason to tax new players well if your gonna bring up that i think ill start a thread about levying a gate usage feeyup everytime you use a gate you get charged a graduated feelets say 100 isk for high sec graduating to 1000 isk for null sechey look it take lots of fuel to keep those babies running and with the war and what not the empires gotta make up some of the losses rightand besides its a fee that isnt targeted at any one type of player so its actualy fair
rubbish
dumb unfair and grossly unbalanced
not supported
cant believe this is even a real proposaland a csm supporting thiswho they working for anyway
for real ughhh
nope no way no how lets just get on with playing the game and stop trying to disrupt it with foolish proposals like this
no support me this thread
no
imo there needs to be some sort of interim solution if the mechanic will be a while changing my friends and i are suffering under a ransom demand seemingly random war dec some have already quit the game and im seriously considering it myself this type of event is clearly part of the current sanctioned griefing issue and if a corp is able to present proof that a war falls under this type it should be eligible for a harassment petition only until the mechanic can be fixed
great another carebearification of evefantactic
1 if you cant defend yourself or withstand a war  you dont deserve the luxury of a corporation 2 if a band of corporations cant defend themselves  they dont deserve the luxury of an allianceback to the safety of npc corps for you then
lets try and look at it another wayif you are a taxi driver and are taken away your drivers license dont you think you are going to get fired you obviously cant do your jobdriving around without it
if a member of parliament stops sending out newsletters do they have to resign that seems a much closer metaphor the forums are hardly necessary for the csm role as evidenced by how many of you shun them frequently they are unnecessary for internal communication for attending meetings for consulting with constituents or for anything else essential if the csm moves to a forumbased system then this might change but given the present system forum access is a throwin not a core responsibility
i beg to differif you want an item on the agenda you have to post on the forum we now have our own private forum where communication does happen it hasnt been the case that the csm is forumbased due to the lack of tools provided to usthe fundamental role of a csm member is to communicate its a 2 way communication in my mind a ban will keep you from doing this job
how about this exampleyou continue to keep posting on the forums about the age question for csm and get a forum ban because of it purely hypothetical ofc would it then be fair to get kicked out csmbesides even then when the rest of csm dont vote you out would ccp still communicate to youwhat if then all of the csm would resign because of thatits all a big what if but its better to think about it now and not when its too late
the hypothetical situation is not likely to happen you need a more likely example to make a pointbut if it did happen then several things can be done either write to wrangler stating the caseassuming i didnt break the rules if he just doesnt bother then internal affairs will have to look into how the community team does their jobhowever the example is really bad and only suits to try and prove a point which in my eyes isnt valid yes the mods are trigger happy from time to time but they arent unreasonable people
being unreasonable isnt as black and white as you might think the csm should at have the ability to form its own opinion about this is ccps change of the min age for csm reasonable is getting banned from the forums because you lost your temper when you got trolled for months reasonable is getting banned because of outing ccp mishaps reasonable
eh i still dont like the idea of removing csms on the basis of a forum ban and letting other csm members vote on it either but on the other hand if youre banned then thatll probably affect your ability to do your expected tasks from which i can see the value of a banned csm member being diminished to the point i may prefer an alternate being put in their place anywayin the case of a game ban im inclined to fully agree with an automatic removal so i approve both on this aspect and primarily the fact that having some clear direction for future csms is very important too thumb upand to be honest i enjoyed almost every minute of it i may not agree with some of the opinions ive seen you put forward but your responses and some of their charges against your opinions often made many subjects i wouldnt have taken much interest in more engaging to readconsider and a convenient distraction from my studies tooso whatre you wearing
yes it is now that they have explained why of course you might not agree with them but they listened and postponed the ruleassuming the reason one would get banned is that you broke the rule sure but we must assume that the troll got banned too in either case you can reason with the community team about your ban if you think the ban is wrongsure you broke the eula so its reasonable and you can always petition it to a lead gm or talk to internal affairs i dont want to get into a discussion on if the kugu case was justice or not though lets just say i have an opinion but its unrelated to this specific point im makingreason is not a 1way thing
i guess we agree on thisno system and nobody is perfect otherwise there wouldnt be the need for csmlets take the following rule
i know posting on the forums to add a topic is standard procedure but if a csm were forum banned and still on the council the chair would surely accept submissions by email ingame convo or a similar mechanism and while i dont dispute that 2way communication is critical it can be done just as easily in jita local or in most of your corp chats as it can be in the assembly hall im not saying that itd be good to have a forumbanned csm member even temporarily im just saying that given present methods of operation i dont think itd be bad enough to justify ejection
i support this
if they receive an ingame or permanent forum ban then they should be removed immediately with no exception however for a short temporary forum ban i think they could be required to abstain from voting until their ban was lifted and one of the alternates allowed to vote in their place
the new forum moderation team is no more enlightened than the old action is created by nothing more than the click of a report button with no examination of the context of the reported post donenow id agree with a review by the council of the offending posts but that lends itself to the same silly bullying the moderation by report button lends itself to a situation where a majority in the council can remove minority representatives is not a healthy one per se im not sure if this is meant to be ironic or not suffice to say youve broken the rules plenty and everyones had their fair share of forum alts attack lets at least be honest if nothing elseedit to clarify the above statement before the report post crew goes into full effect based on what ive been told and how ive seen the forum rules applied many people on the csm have violated the rules repeatedly i dont think the current standards as theyre applied should allow for the moderation team to have more influence than the players in determining who their representatives are the moderation team shouldnt be choosing the representatives the players do and if the players want to elect people who post a particular way i do not see how their judgement should override that of the voters
no you cannot i also do not think the community moderation team should be in the position of determining the players csm candidates especially given that forum moderation has been placed outside of the purview of the csmif the council has no input into the actions of the moderation team then im astounded we would request that the moderation team have input into the makeup of the council
there have been thousands of posts over the years containing the fix lag mantra for many of us its simply become something we deal with on a day to day basis making the best of the situation and dreaming of a day when we could click our modules in the often touted in interviews large fleet battles that many of us are engaged in and have them actually respond within seconds as opposed to 1015 minuteslarge fleet battles are a major selling point for ccp they are sexy furthermore lag is something that impacts every single player of eve whether you be a 00 territorial alliance a factionalempire war corporation or an industrialist who never leaves empirei also realize that ccp accepts and knows that this is a problem so a mere issue raised of fix lag isnt going to accomplish anything what im proposing is that we see a commitment from ccp as weve seen the past 2 or 3 weeks that they will keep the players informed of the steps theyre taking as regards the fight against lag i believe that part of the continued outcry stems from a lack of communication on their part over time this is understandable in some respects as its certainly more exciting to be selling your new content but nobody who plays eve today does not want to know about whats being done to rectify the performance of the gameposting 10000 dev blogs about ambulation in a year and a few minor blurbs regarding lag isnt doing anything to pacify the mob and in reality all i think is required is a bit more regular communication with some actual results and numbers to point to as we had with the stackless io blog and the recent posting regarding upgraded serverstldr id like to see frequent communication from ccp stating that this situation is being rectified and detailing the steps the dev team is taking to combat the sources of lag not everything needs to be out in the open as im sure some of it could be exploited but at the very least a degree of communication should be had which will show that they understand this is an issue and are committed to dealing with itwhile id love to raise a topic of fix lag i think that this is a more realistic approach that may actually pay off
now this is a lag post i can fully support communication with the players  both actual and perceived  would do a lot to alleviate many of these concerns and ease player pressure plus im naturally an inquisitive sort so getting more info appeals greatly to me
i agree completely
yes
more communication from ccp concerning what has been done what is being done and what the future plans are to attack lag are would be greatly appreciated i support this proposal however they also need to stay vigilant on the issue of actually fixing lag in addition to communicating what is being done about iti consistently and frequently raise the issue of lag in massive fleet battles in hopes of keeping the volume turned up on this issue which is of a grave and pressing nature to eve to many subscribers who play eve for many hours every month this is really issue number one we often wonder why we are incapable of convincing ccp that without fixing lag eves future as an unsharded mmo is questionable
i am generally in love with the concept of player enabled content and have been thinking a bit about if this can be done on shipsthe basic idea is this if i fit a ship and provide a bpo for said shiptype i should be able to convert these two to a prefitted ship bpo when producing on this bpo i would then get a prefitted ship with the exact same stuff as put on my original  modules rigs drones and ammothe upside 1 the new ship bpo would have cpu and powergrid calculated on the initial creation of the bpo  thus allowing expert pilots to create good ships to be handed over to not so expert pilots who would usually not be able to use the fittings together due to cpupower limitations2 the prefitted ship bpo could then be researched to reduce the mineral cost of production3 as well as providing a bpo for the ship it should be possible to provide bpos for whatever modules you fit to it provided you have such bpos doing so will add the production costs of the module rather than the module itself to the production costthe downside 1 as a prefitted ship it is not possible to remove any modules whatsoever once the ship is produced its fittings are fixed period2 production cost on the prefit bpo is a mineral expenditure  whatever tech i named and tech ii modules are fitted to the original ship unless module bpo is provided used in creating the bpo mineral research only affects the mineral costs of producing the ship  not the amount of modules needed3 the pilot flying the prefitted ship would of course still be subject to the skill requirements for flying the shipusing the modules no fitting tech ii tachies to an armageddon and handing them to a 3 day old char with absolutely no skillsthe idea behind this is partly to get the various organisations out there to create bpos for whatever shipsfighting style their organisation prefer i would love to some day scan the market for bob sniper mrk 2 or goonfleet hvy tackler shipsor how about me personally fitting an omen with a lot of basic tech i stuff gather all the bpos and combine then into one prefit bpo and then flooding the market with octstyle disposable holy light throw away cruisers for 75 mil apieceof course if ccp nerfs the original ship it should carry through to the prefit bpo and so possibly make it unfittable in which case it should be possible to unravel itlet me know what you think
a cautious thumbs up for this but id like to know about the strain that it would put on the database
while i approve of having stored settings for quickbuilding ships this seems like it would break the database to no real effect make it easier to massfit ships sure but this isnt the way
yeah stored fittings would make more sense then prefitted ship bpos i would love to see an ingame version of eft and maybe even the gang tool from that wellknown siteop not approved
dont you know everyone in eve fits their ships terriblyi cant say i like this idea for a number of reasonsfirstly you can already use contracts to sell fitted ships we also use an internal forumbased market system to order prefit hulls the only advantage here is to the producer and it comes at the cost ofvariety this proposal would shoehorn you into a specific ship configuration for little benefit when ccp changes any particular mechanic ship fittings change thats the nature of the beast in this case youd be left with a crap bpo or ship that couldnt be properly readjusted in short the resale value turns to poopwhat is the producer actually producing im not saying the current system is perfect but it seems to me that what youre suggesting is a system in which a producer can merely be in the bpo copying business to acheive what now is a significant investment of time and im not sure that massscale ship production shouldnt be a significant investement in time
does anyone actually use this module or is it as useless as i think it is it at first glance appears to have a nice high jam strength until you realize a few thingsit doesnt get bonuses from most shipsit costs tons of capit has a 30s cycleit doesnt actually jam anythingit doesnt work on the one thing itd be superusefull against drones since they just instarelockit affects your own fleet members up to 27km away give or takethis module is just horrible there are a lot of really simple things that could be done to fix this moduleit doesnt get bonuses from most ships  let itit costs tons of cap  lower itit has a 30s cycle  lower itit doesnt actually jam anything  fix itit doesnt work on the one thing itd be superusefull against drones since they just instarelock  make it so jammed drones lose their current stance so the user has to reattackit affects your own fleet members up to 27km away give or take  this would be fine if they didnt suck in every other way tooany one or two of these would fix these fine
supporting my own issue of course
i fully support improving the quality of the serversthere is a problem though and the problem is we need to be reasonable if you could improve infrastructure enough that you could have say 1500 people on the same grid fighting whats to stop 3000 people from coming in and bringing the lag back you make it sound like removing the lag is easy when its not without a major leap in technology your going to have to deal with lag as people are going to bring as many as the possibly can before  break as unless you didnt notice people like to win
agreed and supported
actually i heard of a pretty nice idea where instead of attacking one pos in order to get it into reinforced you had to attack five other supporting structures each on a different grid in order to get the main pos shield down its not impossible to make a situation where its better to split your forces up
i complettly support this on a psihological plane is all about goals in a social environment with a hierarchy established like is the 00 environment there always be a need to concentrate brute force in order to acumulate powerthe thirst for power is imperative and this is all about 00 pvp warfare even if you talk about actual pos blobs the miriads of freighters in empire moving alliance goods the matrix of economical products of t2 market with this thirst in mind and with the easy way rule of all human beeings you will see why always more people will be needed in the end if the game mechanics will force the players to spread around systems if game tools will allow and promote this approach of game and if the real power of sovereignity in 00 can be changed only when fleets will battle not only in a single solar system but in entire constelattions maybe we can have epic battles with no or only few laguntil then the hardware evolution will always be outrunned by the numbers of players in a battlein addition of what serenity said i would like to add the change of pipe architecture of constelations so actual travelling tactics strategies would not rotate around choke pointsjust 2 cents from a larger idea i have
just so people know i do actually appreciate ccps recent work on their hardware eve64 and software stacklessio architecture and i do read the dev blogs actually i hover over them like a hawk quite ofteni recently posted this comment and these questions on a dev blog these questions need to be answered by ccp about their ability to predict or quickly respond to the needs to switch a 00 system or group of systems to a stronger server nodefor further information on what ccp is doing to improve performance throughout the tranquility cluster read hereeve64my node was equipped with the followinghowever even after ccp switched moee8 to a dedicated intel eve64 server node and the gbc and northern coalition brought all they had to bear on the system it still crashed a horrible death so there is definitely more work to be done to improve performance for massive 00 fleet engagements
keep up the good work ccp and eventually the dream of 600 vs 600 fleet battles without crippling lag may one day be a reality also for all those naysayers out there that believe this is in vain because it will escalate to more pilots further straining the improved architecture  there are limits to how many pilots an alliance or power bloc can field and bring to the fight however one day as eve grows those limits will also be exceeded and a new mmo super computing cluster will be required  ccp will need to continue to toil and burn to reach ever greater heights of space combat mmo greatness
i have a lot of thoughts on this particular issue on the one hand i think its silly to go to ccp with a fix lag issue of course they want to fix lag duh will be the responseon the other hand i think they havent done a very good job of acknowledging the issue and being forthcoming about what is being done to rectify it this leads people to continuously keep bringing it up and posting these topics and in some cases quitting the game in disgust which in reality doesnt benefit anyonenow what i was originally going to propose was a request that ccp keep the players up to date on this issue that we would pass a resolution requesting that ccp have an ongoing status statement on whats being done to combat lag and improve the situation it certainly isnt nothingthe thing is that in the past 2 or three weeks weve had 2 different announcements regarding lag the first was the stackless io annoucement and the second was the 64 bit server upgrade blog im really not too sunshiney about asking for somehting that they may already be addressing proactively as they see both the performance of the game and their lack of communication on the subject to be detrimentalim going to give this bad boy a bit more thought whatever we deliver should be constructive and useful fix lag is neither
ive detailed a bit regarding what i think is a bit more realistic a response here
copy from cross postmore communication from ccp concerning what has been done what is being done and what the future plans are to attack lag are would be greatly appreciated i support this proposal however they also need to stay vigilant on the issue of actually fixing lag in addition to communicating what is being done about iti consistently and frequently raise the issue of lag in massive fleet battles in hopes of keeping the volume turned up on this issue which is of a grave and pressing nature to eve to many subscribers who play eve for many hours every month this is really issue number one we often wonder why we are incapable of convincing ccp that without fixing lag eves future as an unsharded mmo is questionablei will continue to raise fix lag as the most important issue facing eve we all know what this means and we must continue the message to ccp on this
totally agree with opalso there should be consequences for losinggaining a system the losing side cant dock up stuff like that
i agree fix fw before you even think about anything else such as alliances in fw which would kill fw btwbut wait the csm is debating alliances to be in fw mainly due to the selfish personal opinion of jade trying to push her agenda 23 supports and jade thinks thats a majority to propose the issue when 99 of fw players oppose alliances in fw fw is so broken yet adding alliances deserves a csm push wheres the csm talks about fixing fw and its core mechanic firstjade thats the reason why the csm stinks
just to interject a bit of reality here jade cant pass a single measure by himself if the council raises the issue then it passes by a majority vote i personally support alliances in fw even if mainly because i dont support the idea of mechanics that limit gameplay to certain individuals via artificial means
well as is evidenced in the recent sugestion to tax npc player corp members there seems to be a real desire to have more isk sinks in eve so i offer a counterproposal to levy a jump gate feegraduated from 100 isk in high sec systems to 1000 isk in null secwhy 3 very good reasons 1 it will help reduce lag a bit because when those annoying players who jump in and out of gates just to keep loading and loading the grid thereby creating tons of lag get charged for it they may slow down a bit 2 it doesnt unfairly target one group of players 3last but not least it addresses all those people who recently stated a real need for a new isk sinkwell there you have it
yup werks for me
much more fair than a specific forced tax on a specific group of peoplesupported
cautious support
hmm ok
maybe a tax exemption for freighter pilots  i see many newbs setting autopilot to shortest way  include lowsec
since this is just a troll ill biteif you are going to base this on the fact it takes fuel to run that thing why do i have to pay the same as the guy in a freighter if i am in a frig then i guess you will have to use jb mechanics to make is work
she didnt mention anything about fuelwhere did you get that ideaanyway i think this is a good idea
um sounds like a toll not a trollbut there isnt a country in the world that doesnt impose a toll somewherein there transportation systemso why not in eve and i like the flat graduated fee rather than one based on ship sizesupported
from the other thread she posted the idea this is just a retaliatory response to the the taxing of npc corpsi underlined the funny parts
as i note in the op this is a response and if you want to characterize it as retailiation so be itglad we share the same sense of humourit was meant that waybut on a serious note i strongly feel this is a much more balanced and fair way of creating isk sinksit effects all players using the gates not based on their specific game play or allegiance or non allegiance and as mentioned it also performs other useful tasks
supported
vlandinai view this in the same light as the the npc tax creating isk sinks is fine but not at the expense of game play on a serious note however charging in null sec makes little or no sense if you look at it at it in a rp view those gates are mine if own the region and the powers to be in empire has no reason what so ever to maintain them in a game play sense it just slows down the game play and already we are having issues with fluidity of game play one more headache piled on the never ending mundane and redundant crap just makes it less appealing now as for my view of the npc taxationits silly and stupid the npc huggers not wanting to leave empire for love or money has already penalized themselves they have cut out 90 of the game and that is a shame but to each and his own when i do go through empire i see the npc guys the same way as i see the npc rats and agents they are interactive wall art
we dont need to tax people for playing the game in a way we dont like we dont need to tax them for playing the game at all and we dont need bloody isk sinks this is an even stupider proposal than the one its responding to no matter how many of the ops alts vote for it
implying you have some inside information on a players account info is not imho a very intelligent arguement against a very valid issuetoo many sugestions that severely affect the balance and quality of eve game play have in some measure been supported by some csmsand no doubt there alts if you dont support npc taxes rally your player baseif you dont support this issue do the samebut pretending you have info you do not and should not have is outrageous
010
i support this proposal but only if it includes docking fees and shiptypespecific jump fees goodbye freighter profits also it should be the same for all space but increase in proportion to the number of people in system base fee should be 10k raising by 1 per person in local cumulative goodbye jitamotsurensinsert laggy place here oh yeah and 00 alliances should be able to change the tax from players if they want but it should always come out of the alliance wallet anyway jump tax for the alliance anyonebtw nice alts i assume that you are opposed to npc tax because youre running 5 npc corp chars probably farming missions all dayedit and yes i realise the irony of posting this with my alt but tbh this thread doesnt deserve responses from mains let the alts be with their kind
in case its not obvious i was mocking not stating with knowledge  a bunch of corpless people ive never seen around here before posting unanimous support in relatively quick succession look like alts to me it is of course possible that theyre not but it seems unlikely as for the issue youre proposing that we bleed the poor annoy the rich and deflate a currency thats not suffering from inflation youll pardon me if i vote against it
do a search and youll find imara belong to a corpi dont advertise it so those who might not like my corp wont automaticaly flame the topicvladina is vladina i am me
more and more alliances are requiring its pilots to no longer use missile boats for combat all of the missile based ships are almost worthless in fleet fights because it takes too long to reach targets and either the target is already dead or warped off before the missiles hithalf of the caldari ships are worthless because of this as we are told fly a gun based ship or ewar give caldari more gun based ships or fix the missile issue
as long as fleet fights happen at long range this is inevitable and unfixable well you could fix it if you wanted missiles to have effectively zero flight time under normal circumstances but thats not an acceptable solution my advice to you is either to figure out a way to get your torp raven in closelike say use it in a small fight where its very effective or fly a scorpion or rokh you have gunships and they all have range bonuses for you the problem is that nobody likes them id like to see the nature of fleet fights change so that more play styles are viable including missile ships at close range but even if it doesnt change this is a problem that affects exactly four shipsraven typhoon phoenix naglfar two of which are entirely usable and the other two of which are having their fundamental problem addressed in other threads its hardly a balancebreaker
missile boats in fleet is viable however you have to fit a role like everyone else drakes are decent antisupport and not often targeted first because it is usually a waste of dps at the start of the fightcerbs are actually great antisupport high dps very fast missile speed scorps bbs and falcons are your ewar strength and i do not know of one fc that does not appreciate their presence on the field unless you have to deal with themrohks are awesome snipers just need the trainingcaldari has some pretty decent boats for fleet just need to understand the rolesthere is a trade off with missiles you dont miss and you maintain a consistent dps on your target however the trade off is that it takes a while to get there you just have to think of positioning and how you can be the most effective pick your targets and start shooting the tertiary targets first
more gun boats what like the eagle moa ferox rokh cormorant theres a caldari gunboat in every shipclass but really missiles are bad for fleet sure but they have their place still its not like a rokh does a bad job of being a gunship
misiles are bad me looking at sacrilagecerberusrapiercrow 
caldari misile issue will be fixed with nano nerf they will be brought more inline with guns  higher signatures ion misiles and better reduction of damage vs misiles
yea i think he was talking about having a raven spewing cruise missiles from the north forty and having them take too long to actually hit what you had targeted
support double all missile speed and explosion velocitydone
if youre in a raven just shoot the secondary this is difficultedit or nail the hostile falcons hard to argue with a 3000point pure em damage alphastrike vs falcons
i rarely fly ravens despite them being quite good antisupport as all too often im flying falcononyxrokheagle instead
yeah well i was referencing missiles the only boost caldari missile ships could even think of asking for right now are missile velocityexplosion velocity scripts for tracking computers pic wants to double missile velocity lol 20kms cruise missiles
glad to hear your not standing again one less corrupt member
jade actually covered most of this butthis has been raised with ccp and their pov is that listing accomplishments sets a bad precedent i personally dont agree with that pov and ive said that to them hopefully this will changethe irrelevent side chatter happens between meetings and topics under discussion toilet breaks food breaks etc it has no impact on the time spent on topicsno the lack of transparency of what the csm has discussed with ccp and its outcometimeline to implementation is a big issue as jade pointed out all the meeting records are publicly available from the csm i have a large issue with the lack of support from ccp hosting of minutes lack of forum until very recently 3rd party providers of communications which are all helping to cause people to question what the csm has achieved and whether ccp actually cares about the csm due to only the csm people disseminating information which people like yourself consider biased or corruptits a rock and a hard place situation  csm posts stuff and people scream bias and corruption ccp post stuff and people scream that they arent listening to csm we need something to bridge that gap thats my transparency issue
makes you wonder why ccp email surveys to people who gave up their accounts and is rather reluctant when it comes to communicating with csm
this
i have used them with corp members
as usual ccp are doing a masangsoft on us and just going the communist china route ofignore ignore ban ignore do it our way pr gtfo1sec they dont give a flying  you still pay rightonly way to make these corporate  actually do anything is to take some money away or go get a cyno in polaris and assualt magicland and stationcamp them all until we get banned
i support the reimbursement system being examined simply because im personally biased ive had a comparatively substantial loss refused reimbursement inspite of a much smaller loss easily reimbursed and both eventuated in virtually the same circumstances consequently i more inclined to think that a comparatively substantial loss is likely to be little more than an isk sink even when you have a credible case against thatalso that the logs are more likely to be 350 ft long and made of solid oak than they are to resolve your problems
cmon take off that tin foil hat and cancel your subscription to paranoia weekly we experience the same lag desyncs and other problems you do we just dont whine about it when it happens stay calm get everyone to try logging back in or whatever and if you lose a ship take it on the chin
this is not about lag this is about poor customer service currently the fleet battle policy seems to be used as an excuse not to provide customer service losses that have nothing to do with a fleet battle not being reimbursed because there may be a tenuous connection between the loss and a battle stuck petitions being refused and players left staring at the entering game screen or being stuck in a jumpbridge jump that doesnt complete because gms will not intervene until hostilities have ceased are another such example of appalling atrocious customer service or lack thereofhow can a player who cannot log in be considered part of a fleet battle how can a player who has initiated a jump bridge jump and who can no longer do anything other than wait for it to complete be considered part of a fleet battle yet still the fleet battle policy is used to deny basic customer service  namely to get the player unstuck and enable them to continue playing the game that they pay forto receive a copypaste flat refusal in such a situation is an insult tbhi think the fleet battle policy and reimbursement policy should be reviewed and petitions responded to and grantedrefused on a case by case basis
tower management is terrible overhauls for permissions security and operation are all needed
hello communityi love the eve community and the game and ive wanted to be able to put forth the ideas and concerns that we players have needed to be voicedi ran the first time some months ago trying to fulfill this purpose well it is that time again and while some of the ideas that we players have been desiring have been voiced i still think more can be done if elected my primary purpose will be what you the players are worried about what you want to see donewithout sounding too cliche i want to work for you the eve community as it is you who make this game what it is if given the opportunity to work on the council you will be my focusso i hope i can have your support come election day please feel free to send me an eve mail in game to kaiden exeider and i will be happy to answer any questions or concernsthanks for those who supported me the first time and i hope i can have your continued support this second timehope to hear from you and have your supportkaiden exeider
hellowhat changes do you represent and what do you stand for how do you know what people want what are the current concerns you think are important and ccp needs to hear aboutmaybe you can explain this in this tread or link to your blog thanks in advanceesiq
well first and foremost i would like to fix things that may not necessarily be issues as much as convenience thingsfor example a lot of people have been worried about a skill queue balancing between keeping people from farming to allowing people queue up skills to be trained so there is no missed training timethe fact is character farming will still happen regardless of a skill queue and without it it punishes the legit players i will try to push through the idea of a skill queuealso something else that would be very good especially for those of us who cant log in to change their skill it would convenient to be able to change your skill through the websitefor example lets say your at work and you cant load up eve on the machine or your at school and your schools firewall wont let you log in it would be good to be able to change your skill through your account on the websiteanother thing is clone vat bays for capital ships you can jump clone to it but you cant jump clone from it i think people who use these bays like rorqual pilots and such i would think it would work much like a medical bay this should be fixedalso i would like to push forward the fuel pellet idea that was posited by ccp greyscale where the pos fueling being streamed down something to help reduce the logistical thinking to something more manageable so you wont be confused if you dont have 1 out of umpteen things you have to keep track ofthe liquid ozone and heavy water both serve a distinct purpose so they shouldnt be changed but theres no explicit design need though for towers themselves to burn six different fuel types racial isotopes enriched uranium mechanical parts coolant oxygen and robotics at a constant rate the key point is that we create four racial fuel pellets which replace the isotopes and npc commodities in the starbase fuel bay they are manufactured using blueprints from the relevant isotope type and npc commodities you then just pop in heavy water liquid ozone and fuel pellets and the starbase runs as normalanother thing that i personally would like to see is a class of vessel that will fit between industrial and freighter like a cargo hauler or something to that effect this has already been posted by the current csmanother thing is ive heard the jumpclone timer should be lowered from 24 hours to 12 the idea is that based on playing habits most people might play anywhere from 4  8 hours in a play session as someone who uses a jump clone as a lot of people do ive noticed after a hard day of playing or working the mining fields when your winding down you look at the timer and there might be 13  16 hours left on it and it seems to me 12 of those hours is just excessiveive often asked random players that use jump clones given the option what amount of time would they think is reasonable ive heard 8 hours 16 hours 18 hours but more then most 12 seemed to be the magic number among peopleso i would like to push this up for people and get a resolution on itthis is just a small number on the list of things i am tallying up things that people are saying man i wish this was fixed or why doesnt this work likemainly what ive listed is things that i have heard from people in my personal experience but if elected i would like to create a special email that people could mail me things so i can know on a real time basis what the current attitude and climate is about particular issue or a general consensus of what is the idea or feel of the direction of the game is first and fore most i want to be able to say that i am connected into the pulse of the people of the eve universe and not some bureaucrat or politician that only worries about the people paying the campaign finances or the lobbyists
i dont want to be that kind of councilman i want to know what people are thinking i want to know what people want since you the player is the one shelling out cash for this game your concerns should be foremostmaybe thats a naive way of thinking but its an honest way to think and though im sure i will get flamed for it i know in the end if i am able to fix a third or even half of your concerns then ill call it a job well donekaiden exeider
how do you plan to keep in touch with the community and how will you insure that you deliver what the players wantsince im in the csm and try to represent the players to the best of my abilities instead of furthering a personal agenda i know how difficult it can be to get in touch with the players that do not post on the forums and to read through the whining and altposting that occurs herewhat are your plans in this regardas second part do you have what it takes can you write quality documents and dedicate at least one day a week for meetings and many hours every day to read the forums and talk to players answer your mail appear on the tvradio be interviewed and so on being a csm is a job and requires a lot of effort do you have say 20 hours available per week to serve the communityand as last question what is your background in the game and in real life what is your playstyle and how do you plan to approach other playstyles that are not your own take me for example ive hardly ever set foot in 00 before this whole csm business but once i became part of the csm i suddenly had to vote on issues regarding 00 sov capital ships black ops and many more things id say at least half the issues were issues i never had given much thought no matter what your area of expertise is how do you plan to deal with issues outside your comfort zone especially if the players want you to deal with them all of the suddensorry for the difficult questions but at least it prepares you for what is to come ps skillqueue has already been through the csm
welcome to the rat raceankh already beat me to mentioning that skill queue has already been raised id note as well that i believe simplification of fueling was raised as well via the flogging the dead horse proposal in assembly hall
that is correct at least you did a good job explaining the issues with pos fuelling in iceland to the devs directly
no i like it well thanks for taking your time and explaining what you stand for im sure it will make your case stronger good luck with the campaign esiq
well i think we should look at the fact that i am already thinking like you do as evident by what your saying as some of these issues i have listed here is already int he process of being worked oni am a writer and going to school for game design going to get a bachelor of science degree when its all said and done so as far as expertise i am being taught not just how to program or create animations but also to design games from the ground up basically i am being groomed on basically being a dev and maybe one day i will bei read the forums everyday specifically the game design section and read what people are saying i log in everyday if even to just check my mail i would even go so far as to say i wish there was a csm meeting weekly as far as appearances tvradio you name it where ever the opportunity to speak and present i will take it i would like to say i am perpetually oncall for the communityas far as play style i am an industrialist but the people that i have surrounded myself with are of many different play styles and have a constant barrage of issues that are important to them and many a time i have wished i was able to help them with iti plan on having a dedicated email for both internal use ie for csm members to contact me and external use  for the public to contact me and maybe even a blog to constantly keep people up to date with whats going on and whats being discussedhenry ford was quoted saying i may not know how to build a automobile but if you give me 5 minutes i can contact those i employ who domy meaning is that even though i do not know everything about eve i do know a multitude of people from many different backgrounds and points of view and i have access to that so if i dont know it i know how to find out i am constantly exploring eve related websites of both corps and just people who have information about the game that is relevant to the topic that i am needing to research aboutthough there is no substitute for experience i would like to believe that i am prepared to serve if given the opportunityi hope this answers your questions ankhkaiden
the result of discussion in at least ten different monstrous threads regarding sov and also a place to talk about potential bigpicture changes to 00 in the context of steering the devs in a direction for great justices all of themthe triangle of concerned parties00 alliancesinterests are enhancing the value of 00 easing the logistical nightmare making sov more meaningful better sov warfare concerns are that increasing 00 volatility will undermine an already shaky and kinda meaningless 00not boblesser alliances who find the get mowed down by 100 dreads nomad lifestyle kindai pay for this game too interests are lowering the barrier to 00 entry increasing viability for a hundred pilot alliance to pull hundred pilot weight and increasing volatility such that cap fleets are not the sole measure of sov projection concerns are that increasing the strength of 00 holders will skew the balance of power in favor of super alliancesempirepirates carebears and hisec blingblingers concerns are like the notbobs that increasing the income and prominence of 00 will simply squelch empire play such that empire becomes a relative slum even for isk farmerswe are not so differentcompromise point 1compromise goal is to lower 00 access barrier and provide avenues for the notbobs to assert their presence while at the same time lifting the position of 00 powers and providing avenues for more meaningful sovmake 00s biggest income generator accessible from day one with minimal investment then make the form of that income useful only to 00 powers with established infrastructure 00 wealth will be easily accessible to all leveling the playing field at a very nascent stage while at the same time leaving a hierarchical source of economic power less exposed and more to the tastes of large alliances raw materials through mechanisms are responsive at the subcap level while production can be controlled via mechanisms that are responsive at the cap level implementation proposal will follow at some pointcompromise point 2compromise goal is to address the issue of poor sov combat as well as providing a more versatile fight broker that scales better with engagement size provides impact via tactics simplifies process of sov and gives ccp more possibilities to distribute load in the futureconcensus reached in a thread fathered by goonswarms fahtim was that the proper sov instrument will be a multigrid solution based at planets system will create simultaneous combat at multiple grids that will amplify the affects of better mobility and force distribution planet base system is simpler and more consistent than moons multigrid solution also adds more balance by reducing effectiveness of pure blobbingcompromise point 3compromise goal is to preserve the place of empire while allowing 00 to flourishsimilar to capship production add new facilities and hulls to further provide a sink for 00 income as well as increasing the appeal of 00 without overwhelming empire player productivity with the excess wealth of a 00 flush with blingstructures that form the basis of utilizing productivity gained from structures in point 1 should be expensive flashy a point of uberness for alliances that make the leap responsive solely to cap threats via sov mechanisms in point 2  and provide unique goods to 00 holders that are not marketable in empire thus protecting empire economy from the end result of that income buff implementation proposal to follow at some pointplease discuss these compromise solutions for 00 improvement in broad terms and attempt to direct discussion towards widereaching aspects
as with most of these types of threads some very interesting points and proposals are raised your points 1 and 3  get resources of some kind from 00 usable primarilyonly in 00 and make them the primary profit source  lead to an interesting idea two end products of the type you describe already exist  capital ships and posoutposts obviously it would overthrow a large variety of the existing economy if those were to be transitioned to something other than minerals and cash as their source given that both are largescale sinks of their respective types  much as inflation isnt a problem now it could be if you removed large cash sinks without making corresponding adjustments  but it might be possible what if for example all poses outposts and components thereof were made from blueprints and those blueprints used minerals sourced primarilyonly in 00 space youd throw the economy for a loop in the short term though i suspect people would stockpile to bridge the gap but it might yield the sort of situation you describe replace a large portion of the cash bounties from belt rats with component drops which means the primary source will be 00although empire can source it at dramatically reduced efficiency and that should cancel out the loss of a cash sink i propose ratting suddenly becomes the only source for 00 infrastructure which might shift some emphasis to smallgang raids and which yields the desired result of making the raw source open to just about everybody while leaving the manufacturing closed to make the loop complete make the only feasible way to produce poses be an outpost and the only feasible way to produce an outpost be via poses  say ludicrous time requirements with 90 time modifiers on factories of the appropriate typeor if youre feeling really mean a similar material modifier you can bootstrap your way up from empire stations but you wont want to as ever im just pulling things from my posterior when i muse about 00 overhauls but im curious about other peoples thoughts
thank you sir i believe it is possible to avoid the inflation issue entirely by decoupling the new 00 production from the empire economies i mulled over this a lot in the acdc thread i was working on and concluded that 00 goods will never inflate or deflate because all that will happen is demand will grow and subside i summed up the philosophy in the slogan moar ships moar pew pew we all saw what happened when the drone regions flooded the market with nocx and other high ends imagine if instead drone minerals were only useful in 00 they would be produced in 00 consumed in 00 and balanced by the pew pew supply and demand relationship just a for instancea lot of the philosophical base im working off of was the result of the thought process in the acdc thread i didnt take that particularly seriously as apparent in the noholdsbarred uber abstracted writing style but got some surprisingly smart replies please come againat current 00 looks a lot like what i would call the salary man model where mechanics that resemble work are used to limit things like scope creep and single alliance domination after all the thought process in the acdc thread im aiming to shift to what i call the nba superstar model where the high capabilities of players are balanced instead by each other overall a shift from the game itself slowing us down to more player driven limiting factorsthe reason why ive chosen these two monikers is that the salary man works to build what he has while the superstar is paid by the league revenues we can simulate space as a place for upbythebootstraps self made men or as a giant sports franchise where good players get paid a lot more and while bench warmers make less nobody spends time grindingone of the big things i have in mind is the idea of selfconstructing production structures for raw materials ask yourself if we need poss to determine sov etc why are the players expected to grind just to come up with the income to set upmaintain the mechanics necessary to have sov warfare and 00 production it should not fall on the shoulders of players to slave away to build the game they have come to playas far as where the loop should exist im imagining something like this you step into 00 win a few skirmishes to get left alone drop some eggs that are about 50m a piece add water come back in a few days while fending off counterattacks and its a production platform for asteroids or moons etc and is going to earn you 500m per planet or sothe goods exist in some kind of mineral formation that requires extraction at a higher level facility which requires sov and more timemoney to build this produces a more generalized product which is used for basic space bling or it can be sold on up the chain to the megaalliance with a fully established research facility so they can produce their limited quantity factionesque space blingthe idea is to make the basic component of this space bling accessible at the minimal level of presence in a system the production platforms should be at the sub cap level and get blown up and rebuilt at a fast pace however to keep this huge source of dynamic 00 from completely destabilizing large alliances and forcing them to run all over space make the producers of these raw materials beholden to powers with established infrastructure as 00 is beholden to empire right nowas far as making poss or anything only producible at well established 00 facilities im working against any mechanics that raise the barrier to getting into 00 the basic eggs etc should be seeded in empire and always fairly cheap they exist so we can have things to fight over not have things to grind for
you might want to change not bob to not mob  o potherwise your going to come off as a whiner to some peoplemight as well say not goon or something at that rateit could be any number of alliances with there numbers call me picky but the message is still the samebut your points are valid the mob mentality is what i think of when looking at point 2
gramyreall three of these compromises will leave 00 much better off for everyone megaalliances fully includedi doubt goons enjoyed the seventysomething moons in qt or any other system same goes for everyone switching to a planetary sov instrument is a huge gain as far as the mob mentality im not sure what youre getting at ill try to answer but please elaborate further the instrument as developed in fahtims thread would work to the advantage of any well organized fleet of any size compared to a jumbled blob of any sizenicer structures would be an immeasurable benefit right now were relegated to fighting over spacesticks that give rights to a flag on a map or an outpost that looks like every other outpost and will get named something ridiculous because nobody really cares ive taken to heart what darius had to say and my own experience in 00 as far as lack of gold at the end of the pos rainbowgiving large alliances a more pivotal role in the income stream of 00 without requiring them to worry about every little moon should be a welcome change as well under my proposed compromise losing a few of the new production streams at the base level wont immediately or detrimentally affect a large alliance that can benefit from the steady supply of raw materials any smalltime raiders will have to offloadwith all those benefits to large alliances i hope the few hypersensitive pilots who get their feelings mistakenly hurt can get over it

iused to have three accounts on the gotraining alt for rorqualthe rorqual been made low sec only and the the credit crunch has made me put that account in stasis so to speakanybody else changed their game because of world events nb read on msn iceland maybe bankrupticeland agreed to adopt sweeping powers over banks on monday as its financial system tottered its currency plunged 30 percent and a leading agency cut its credit ratingsthe small countrys financial stature had swelled in recent years as its banks expanded overseas investors took large positions in its highyielding currency and foreign firms poured money into local projects
i dont have time to get into a proper economic analysis of this right nowwait a few hours but the fact that the rl isk has fallen by 14 against the euro will do wonderful things for ccps bottom line  they just got all their icelandic employee salaries cut by 14 compared to their income streams
as i read more information about whats happening to iceland right now im struck by just how much of a cluster the world banking system is right now this is of course the same thing thats been striking me since i heard about the lehmanmerillaigfanniefreddie collapses and the associated bout of temporary insanity the financial sector underwent seriously tbills earning 4 bp per annum at the same time as the cds rate on tbills quintupled to 30 bp per annum insanity i still have trouble believing that something as blindingly obvious to anybody who looked as houses are overpriced right now could blow up in the worlds face this badly thank you fannie and freddie for the gifts you have brought us with regard to the iceland situation specifically the banks of the world are currently engaging in the first recoded run upon themselves because of a catastrophic loss of trust among all involved meaning that banks are sitting on their own money instead of loaning it interbank which is why libor has done such silly things recently oddly this hasnt hit customers much since a good credit risk is still a good credit risk but its hitting banks like a sledgehammer since theyre all deeming each other to be poor credit risks icelandic banks have the misfortune of being based in a country that cant bail them out of deep water even if they wanted to and so the government is stepping in in advance to secure sources of credit other than banks as for your comment about what effects its having on eve players i suspect youll see a rise in gtc pricesas more people want to avoid spending extraany money on their entertainment budget and a drop in the number of alt accounts but really no effect on main accounts  people tend to cut their rudimentary entertainment budgetbe it mmos movies or booze last in times of financial distress because it takes their mind off it
how does the worth of isk effect my spending on eve
it doesnt unless youre paying for your account with gtcs because you dont have the cash for it
just make conquerable stations and outposts launch sentry guns as they are in empire nerfed a little that are configurable in aggrono gate guns no gate guns
i can not see the reasoning behind this proposal it cant be for defense especially if you are proposing sov 3 or 4 to have themany alliance with that sov wont be needing gate gunsit would also make it more difficult for small gangs and solo 00 players to travel about in 00 space there should imo be some encouraging reasons to do such activities rather than sit in empire space all the timetake carearithron
the problem with the current system of popular placement of topics is that as per the rules the bar was set higher than the interested and engaged portion of the playerbase could hope to achieve that bar will be lowered in the next cycle having the bar set so high meant that in order for any topic to even make it to the council causes had to be championed by the council if they were not thered be very little for the council to discuss at allwe also have to remember that we do elect csm representatives what you have to keep in mind when electing a representative is that youre electing a vote youre also electing a voice that can champion any issue they like which should give you a bit more pause for thought when considering whom you are voting forultimately i think that in a perfect world the representatives would be championing both their own causes and those of the community ive personally voted multiple times for items i felt were quite silly i voted positively for the items because they did not have any negative repurcussions i could anticipate on the way i and my constituency choose to play eve why should i vote down something that will bring joy to someone else if it doesnt impact me in any negative fashionhell ive voted for things that have impacted me in a negative fashion simply because i was able to see that they were better for the game thats just a part of the tough choices you have when choosing whom to cast your vote for i should think at the very least youd be looking for someone who didnt just champion your causes but also that youd take into consideration whether or not they could be trusted to exercise reasoned judgment in cases where the items presented were not personally of interest to them believe it or not there will be a lot of times where your chosen representative will have no opinion positive or negative on the item on the table but their yes or no vote is required
hello allin general i think the nano nerf is a bad thing it was only rumored to be included in one of the trinity expansions and we saw the alloyed tritanium bars market take a nosedive because of itmy solution would be this have webs operate a bit differently momentum should still be a factor but it should be less of a factor than it is now if youre going at 3kms and get webbed you can usually break it without breaking a sweatthe reduction thing can be changed as well so that top speed is not cut as greatly but the momentum thing should be looked at from my experience with pvp nano and nonnano this seems to be the hinge pointi feature an option for smaller deployables on my webpage here but generally this does seem like the way to go as far as the industrial side ive had other ideas that i have yet to post on my website but will post it soon
that is right i am running for csmas a csm member i will bring change change is what we needi will also fix the current financial crisis tma vote for me is a vote for change
screw that vote for me and ill vote nay on everything that comes up in csm vote for me is a vote that eve is good as it is ps im not really running for csmits a totally useless bunch anyway but you can go for it and use same agenda as above for mere 1 billion isk
lol you can put lipstick on a pitbull
a nuance i think maybe not puppets but certainly the sort of pr buffer zoneby the looks of things the information available to me i am about 23s familiar meaning i am reasonably familiar plus my ignorance is only put forth in the case that something the csm actually did something which created change my being familiarness has nothing to do with the pr buffer that which is the csm its an undeniable factok not that any of that really mattersduhyou can view anything any way you like doesnt bother meyou make the assumption that i dont see them that way also in reality this is true but they have limited resources and tons of change ideas features forum gets loads of suggests everyday someone has to be there to say noas we kind of established in this thread there is no conduit from csm to ccp features forum vs csm forum is exactly the same thing ccp does what they do when ideas dont get into the game its kind of the csm voting no now instead of ccp saying noi propose something to the csmvote on something absolutely ridiculous like allowing supercaps into high sec and allowance to use dd in high sec then submit that to ccp see what happens you will get told no anything ccp does change that might coincide with csm is just coincidence
your test is stupid the csm is not a decisionmaking body its an advisory body if your doctor tells you to walk for an hour every day you probably do it but if he tells you to walk for 24 hours every day you get a new doctor no matter how much you may trust the advice of doctors in the abstract the csms role is to shift focus to raise counterarguments and to emphasize that the players as a whole really want something instead of just a few vocal forum whiners it is of necessity subtle because ccp cant give them direct power that does not mean that they dont have power it merely means that you dont get to see them exercising it over the short term if you want them to be able to stand up and proclaim that they forced ccp to make the game free or something equally nonsensical then youre going to be disappointed if however you understand that ccp really does have the best interests of the game at heart that they really do want to hear the imput of the players and that they really are eventuallyoh god so eventually going to do what they say theyre going to do then youll understand why the csm exists what its role is and why it matters
yes i said the test is stupidridiculous thats the pointso they do have power could you please post an example of where they were using this power oh right that really isnt possiblenope i want just 1 example of them changing ccp mind as it wereid love to link you a video of the privateersalliance who kept over 50 wardecs constant all the time were using a nanodomi with nos and ogre2s and a nanophoon then compare that to todays stuffevery single bit of that has been nerfed the torps on the phoon no longer fly 75km the bs nanos arent anything like that anymore the domi nos is changedall these things have been changed because forum whiners got big whine threads goingnow go look in assembly hall any threads which only get 2 posts in it wont even get mentioned at the csm the big whine threads are the ones which get csm attention then they vote yes or no ccp reads assembly hall they can decide to make change without csm voting csm for all i care could vote no on everything and then see change and oh wait
my point was that it doesnt illustrate anything testing via ludicrousnessaka reductio ad absurdum is fine in many cases but this isnt one of them your test would only be meaningful if ccp did it on the csms advice  in other words if they were as powerful as you seem to want them to be unfortunately we dont have a lot of responses from ccp just yet what with the limited time in iceland and the slow release schedule on the second submission thus i can only point you here here here here and here for examples of things that the csm apparently changed ccps opinion on at least somewhat one of the changes has even been implemented being the one that required the least programming work yeah but those torps did 23 the dps of the current ones overall i think that change was for the better battleships shouldnt be usefully nanoable and the old nosses were too strong by far meaning that those changes were good too nonetheless you rather illustrate my point here prior to the csm ccp had no useful quantitative metric for determining what players thought and so they used forum static as a proxy now they have a real broadbased measurement scheme  the csm elections  and can make information judging by what the representatives of some ten thousand of the players decide rather than what some ten dozen talk about or do you think that eve general is a better proposal mechanism for game changes than the csm
the new csm wont be rolling in before late november dont worrywe discussed this with ccp last weekend so there should be an official minutes on this issue sometime soon i have no idea when though
cool  thanks
on the 11th we will be having the hopefully last csmccp meeting for this round we have issues which werent discussed inside our window of oppertunity with ccp last weekend so it will be next weekendto be fair against ccp the last month or two has been the conference seasoni for one spent a weekend far away from home due to my attendance in one of the said conferences ccp obviously sent their employees there this means that people like noahccp hammer werent available during the weekends after the initial response thus it had to be postponed till these 2 weekendsprior to the meeting we had saturday we had some very interesting discussionsand lots of absurd jokes on how to thrust forward csm and take it to the next level dr eyjog greyscale and hammerhead especially seemed very enthusiastic about csm which was really niceso i would certainly not give up hope the wait is over very soon hopefully sadly when coordinating these kinds of things not only with 7 csm members but also a large company like ccp its bound to be a slow process but thats just the way it is
bump
great idea
supporting this why damaged items cant be removed from a ship remotely is beyond me
agreed
yes we need yea and nay
ive changed my mind from what i said in my last post id prefer dual skill training because unlike the other systems it also reduces the problems new players have with learning skills by allowing players an easy way to balance it just keep a learning skill in the second slot until you run outthough when i think about it i would regularly be able to make use of up to maybe 4 skills training simultaneously any more than that i wont make much use of naturally if im training n skills they all train at 1n speed but 2 skills at a time is enoughdo i train for new items now screwing myself in the long run or train learning skills making myself bored in the short term
i so wanted to troll this but lavista is probably the best csm so bah
just curious  where on earth do you live where its legal to do drugs at 18unless you mean like paracetamol and ibuprofen
my guess would be the netherlands does anyone else actually legalize drugs
california
i thought california law just decriminalized them and even then the dea still exists there californians routinely go to jail under federal drug laws that the federal government has no right to make because they decided back in the 1930s that following the constitution wasnt cool anymore
come on ccp let 18 and up participate lavista vista is a great csm members  and the one of 2 supported come on folks
theyve changed their minds theres no age limit for round 2 itll be coming in with round 3
i would have thought that 20000 years from now or whenever eve is set that a technology would have been developed that makes bumping into another shiproidstation irrelevant and not damagingnice idea but way too 21st century for eve ab
yes mass and speed needs to be taken in to account when bumping keep the bumping until something is done to station games or anything that justify bumping now i dont see that happening since webbers will be soon losing some effectiveness and ramming people is realistic way to prevent them from escapingas for collision damage no never not in a million years anyone thinking it needs to answer the following question does collision damage count as aggression if yes does concord get involved propably no since otherwise concord would be the biggest griefer in the game just park a noobship on a freighters path and collect the loot after concord delivers quick justice to the aggressor even without concord response its not hard to envision that players would force carebears to accidentally aggro them autopiloting anything anywhere would be out of the question so maybe there should not be aggro from collisions this would propably introduce a new and funny gank where higsec pirates gangram people to death and concord doesnt react how realistic would that be you could avoid some of these problems by implementing hard limits how low your armorstructure can fall but that would not be realistic so why change one unrealistic mechanic for another
mass is already taken into effect when it comes to speed your ship will not be knocked off alignment if a ship the size of a frig impacts you at 6kms i dont know where youve been bumping but i have never seen a ceptor sucessfully bump anything bigger than a cruiser i will grant that bumping is a rather cheep tactic but so is dockwar and so are many many other ways of screwing your fellow man in eve i too would like to live in a fantasy world where bs fights happened outside of stations and neither side docked logofski was impossible and pvp was king but i dont see how stopping bumping will alter this if the problem is that small ships should not bump big ships then this problem is already addressed they dont
riskrewardjf offer massive reward over industrials which carry less but are infinitely more risky if you let them cyno into high sec then its going to be almost entirely riskless just deal with the fact that your uber hauling ship isnt ultimate and untouchable and give us lowsec pirates something to shoot at maybe you should make some friends to defend it and plan ops around it instead of making it the kind of thing you can do at any time because your on with all your cyno alts

f1f12
 dex timorthx for your reply i really appreciate such postings and you made a good point as well though some of your assumptions are not correct let me explain1 i dont have a particular problem with recruiting as many posters have stated before
while i definetly empathise with much of your sentiment still i feel you are incorrect suggesting that npc corp members are immune from consequencesthats what concorde is for and ccp has finaly addressed some of the issues people had with that perhaps if this plan had sufficient leverage for newer playerslets say no longer than 6 months and perhaps those who continualy hop in and out of npc corsbut again by imposing such limits you are presenting ccp with a lot of headache and possibly to the point they would just reject the idea as a wholebut i got to say thisi have rarely been hassled much by npc characters so again this could just be seen as a way to hinder new players and a futile attempt to prevent use of alts not sufficient reason imho to make such a complex change
nay because its ccp and quality of gms and cms are sloppy at best and besides it should not be up to the above to decide over csm ps who got banned the goonswarm guys
me not to insinuate that it was the cause of this thread in any way but i wouldnt wish anyones removal from the council for the two heinous posting crimes of1 a yo mama joke on caod 
this is not true jade has had a full permanent forum ban in the past and was allowed to participate there was a cut off period where if you had had a ban that was not due to an eula violation or egregious violation of the forum rulesnot an exact quote you were given amnesty this amnesty carried over into the csm processre darius oftentimes they will not discuss it with the person in question either i have received warning and other moderation and not once heard back asking for clarification or protesting the decision
full permanent bans aint what they used to beyou must be an insane forum  to think such a statement i read the ah and jpsc and a post by the csm is a rarity not the standard communication from csm delegates ahahahahahahahahahaha csm cant do their job without posting on the forums you overestimate the power of the eveonline forums lavista vista i suggest you actually go take the time omg effort incoming and read the ah topics not just the ones that interest you note how many csm repsonses their are then go to a topic that you or another csm member really cares about and see how many csm repsonses over one line are in that thread communication my ass more like using the csm to further your own agenda dont bull me
so who got banned
yes it was harder to get a full permanent ban back then than it was today and the penalties that accrue leading up to said ban are more severe now
name me one csm member who doesnt do thatgoons hmm no agenda there im suresarcasmas for jade constantine lolagendasame for all the rest they are just the most obvious examplesand do you know what nobody cares it was expected they would which is why players voted for the one they wanted
you are very much mistaken there goumindong back in the day it used to be possible to get a permanent forum ban for 10 signature size offenses if you were unlucky enough or any combination of minor transgressions the problem was that the forum rules made absolutely no distinction between minor issues and serious ones and simply handed out then permaban stick at a count of 10 the new forum regime has several important improvements over the last one firstly most minor offenses dont actually involve warnings  where threads can be cleaned up with deleted bits locks or moves those dont obligate the moderators to give warnings example being obvious ooc material on the igs forum  the moderators remove the offending material now  but dont have to give warnings while they do it though they do give public direction to the people making this mistake secondly as far as i know its not possible to actually get a permanent forum ban in the new regime without posting something outrageous on the eveforums  and this means seriously offensive material i think we can all agree that somebody posting ography or extremely nasty images deserves what they get there was a reason that scores of perfectly good posters got permanent forum bans back in the day and that was that all offenses were considered equal and it was a 10 strikes and youre out regime fortunately thats all changed weve now got a professional moderation crew  and the moderators are using a lot more discretion in using surgery on bad threads and posts rather than a ubiquitous banstick and things are definitely better from the ccp end at least
v0v forum moderation is not within the csms purview so im really not sure where you could go to get that rectified aside from asking that your request be escalated which may very well still get you nowhereas far as the amnesty while it was certainly necessary i wouldnt go so far as to say that it is no longer held against you its quite the opposite
i suspected as much oh of course not re 1 that seems a less offensive thing than dozens of others ive seen elsewhere more juvenile but then what do you expect of a goon on caod re 2 i said nastier things in the same vein to the same person on the same thread gotta love the vagarities of the report button i thought the council had jurisdiction over everything eve related youve brought up the forums pricing schemes and all sorts of other things outside the purview of the game itself why would forum management be any different
where do you get this from
the community manager ill email the relevant portion of the email to the mailing list or post it on the csm forum
theres a csm forum
that was pretty much my line of thought and i said as much regarding various other posts in the thread v0v difference of opinion i supposeim not sure why its different only that ive been informed it is i dont agree with it either but i dont work for ccp and wasnt a part of that decision tree
yes as of about 2 weeks ago
yes so far its just used for discussing issues which are being raised
that seems like an odd use  each topic being raised already has a forum thread by definition you have the mailing list for private communications and the eve boards for public  whats this third one for
its a better format than the mailing list for communicating the mailing list is also provided externally rather than ccp imo ccp should be providing the tools the csm needs to operate so while im opposed to the private comms at all its better comms provided by ccp than some random 3rd party
well we already spend tons of time during meetings asking questions on each issue its more productive to do that in a forum before the meeting but it has obviously not been the case that people are interested in that seemingly because they have to do it in a public forumso in order to actually have some kind of meaningful discussion i personally as well as a few others posted all the issues that was being raised right on thereit was not very well adopted though also the mailing list is a privately hosted one by serenity steele it would not be good if it was to be passed on to the next csm a tool provided by ccp is much better

numerous people have suggested numerous individual ways through which the lag situation can be imrpoved its time ccp stops ignoring the player base adding new and largely pointless features like medals ambulation and other crap and fixes one of the most crippling issues in the gamesigned
communication is vital be honest with the players and your trust will be returned
knowing we were hearing from people actively working to reduce lag was amazing re stackless io blog probably moreso than knowing that there was a breakthrough in reducing lag
the more information the betterenjoyed knowing about the stackless io stuff shows ccp is not ignoring the issue

communication is always extremely important i will support any initiative that is taken to make ccp communicate more and be more transparent however i will admit that ccp has been really good at it as of late fine no mention of infiniband as of yet but i guess its to comealso how much are you are you guys experiencing lag as of late i must admit i havent taken part in a major fleet fight as of late but i must admit all the very crowded system i have gone tojita on sunday night have been a really smooth experience
lag is still experienced daily i was warping around empire hte other night and experiencing all manner of weird bouts warping to gates out of synch and such quite a few people in the destination system were complaining about it thereve also been quite a few fleet battles that im aware of which were impacted
thumbs up
eve would be the best mmo out there if the huge fleet battles were lag freei totaly support this
what a good idea
yes
thumbs up
this one is straight forward when you receive a mark or a warning of any type against your account either for your posting on the forums or ingame the notification is either emailed to an external email address or sent via evemail evemail today is all but useless and i dont believe relying on an external email address beyond the control of ccp and often the enduser is the wisest course of actionid like to recommend to ccp that these items be placed somewhere accessible to you from the forums under my account for instance so that you may review these items and players dont encounter a situation where they receive a warning of some type but are unaware of it i honestly dont see this as something which is anything other than reasonable and it should probably already be there
makes sense i can support it

wow amazing suggestionfeature not to mention it would reduce the calls to db for each activationdeactivation if implemented properlytrueup
i can see your logic about stackless io reducing lag thus making it less of a concernbut i dont think just because we have had such an awesome improvement that it means we can just throw db calls all over the place we could reraise this issue but you will get the response much sooner if you ask a dev during a qa session at fanfest
people regularly change ammo type anyway a way to do it in less clicks wont affect what is already done regularlyif you really want to complain about lag just set a limit eg you can only change ammo for every weapon every 1 min or whatever
ok how about it only working while in station
1 how is this different than ctrlr your doing a reload all weapons with avaiable ammo command there2 could you not just setup a client side macro disguised as a reload all with ammo x buttonthis macro would reload all turrets with the new ammo using a sequential time delayed commandiesend commands to reload turret 1 with ammo xwaitsend commands to reload turret 2 with ammo xwaityou could even make the delay longer that a humans manual reload time thereby decreasing the command spikes on the serveredit phrasing
how about having it automatically stagared so when you hit reload all you get an ingame macro that unloads one gun loads it unloads the next gun loads it etc hell if you time it right you might even reduce lag
well text limits turns out to be in place to prevent exploitsccp doesnt want to discuss exploits so really theres not much we can do
maybe ccp should fix those exploitseven just increasing limits would be good eg 2x the limit for bio mail and notesalso it needs some kind of indication when it is over the limit or even preventing you from adding more notes has one but it only gives a warning when it is a lot over the limit and not a bit if it is only a bit over the limit then first thing you know is when you open it and see the end has been cut off
there are a couple corner cases where unlimited lengths would indeed be exploitable  for example using your bio as a lag bomb as mentioned above it would be woefully indiscriminate but it would break the game for the poor sap who looks at you that sort of thing does need to be avoided which is why i mentioned pagination above but aside from that im really confused by what they could be referring to if its possible to put a virus or similar into the game by typing it in plaintext they really need to work on their security measures and if theyre referring to players putting so much stuff in that it overflows their system i did say that i was fine with limits that didnt interfere with most user experiences i know ccp wont discuss exploitsand i concur with that policy for that matter and so i dont suspect that well ever have an answer to this but still i really wish i knew what they were talking aboutin any case note my edited proposal above  its still worth bringing forward imo since it gives ccp room to deal with these concerns while still hopefully getting this issue at least partially addressed
this is utterly insanethe spirit of the idea is validbut you failed to take one thing into accountwhat the hell happens to a player whose brokebut picks up a mission that is not in the local systemoops guess you forgot to think about thatthats all we need beggars asking for a few hundred isk just to do the missioncompound that exponentially and you have an even bigger mess than beforeepic failthumbs downps and before you make a response also take into account standings could be negative or systems with very few if any agents and then some this nothing more than a big fat annoyance to drive away players
well im glad people are paying attention to this threadand questioning the whole premise of arbitrary isk sink threadsnot unlike the npc player corp taxthey are just that arbitrary useless and just a complete hinderance to game play in eveif you dont support this thread i hope you also will not support the npc corp tax thread
it should be free in 00 and gradually increasing by 100 isk per 1 sec gain to 1000 isk for high secnot the other way aroundencourage people to migrate from jita not oposite
the npc corp tax was not suggested as a thoughtless isk sink it was suggested as a fee for invulnerability to wardecs i think the rationale was a bad one but at least it had a rationale jonathan swift you arent
and yet i think youll agree ccp had a damn good reason for itso new players could have a safe relativelyplace to develop skills and prepare for the larger evethis tax will needlessly hinder those players should they pay for the sins of those who decide to stay and clutter up and abuse the npc corp i think not
in nullsec asessing a fine would be a great way to end small gang warfare forever i dont want to have to spend any isk for a roam period if this were implemented in 00 it should be for sov 3 or 4 systems and the isk goes to the alliance wallet i think this would be a great way to get the game to move into low and nulsec you should actually decrease the fines the further from 10 you go pilots would then be encouraged to leave 10 quickly and enter more profitable lowsec and the concept of the cheep but risky industrialist might actually come around besides it makes sense the further from government you are the cheaper taxes and levies get
at the risk of supporting something i just flat do not care fori will say its a major issue regardlessive heard its common for corps to get wardecedthen the whole lot of im just duck and cover by bailing out of the corp and leaving an alt on the ceoyet the purpose of the said ability is for people to evade greifingand no i dont give a  about what you think about that biti will offer this ideaif your going to prevent acts of cowardace and abandonment with tactics such as corp jumpingrequire a fee to be paid to concorddedscc whomever for leaving a corp during a time of warthe fee should be substantial but not insaneor perhaps have the fee be made payable to the war decing corp which personally i dont like but its incentive enough to have an impact on your honor and ethics of bending over and saying kick me to the corp thats war decing youthis way you pay a fine for invunerabilityyou can also require an enterance fee for joining a corp as wellperhaps a cool down period of a week or moreduring wardectheres many ways you can take thisbut unlike a tax its centered around an area of exploitation the ability to hide under a rock without penalty
hasnt corphopping to avoid a wardec already been declared an exploit like a year ago i thought you could petition it and have them get put back into the corp
not if your leaving a corp to join an npc corpcorp jumping makes sense as an exploitbut leaving a corp still is technically speaking corp jumping only your going to a default place holder which makes you immune to war decs
i may be wrong but i thought that was banned too if its not then there should be something providing an incentive not to do this agreed this is probably best addressed by revamping the war system but ill agree that something is necessary
afik you dont get banned unless someone really pursues the matter to the extremesafter all it would mean those who join up and then find out they are getting wardecd as part of the bonuss of joining a corp and then change there minds about the whole thingwould be messy at besthence my suggestion of using finesfeesif they want to avoid wardecs they should penalize people so to speak
the exploit you are referring to is leaving a corp to reform it exactly at it was before under another name leaving a corp to join another in time of war npc or pc is in no way an exploitthe op idea is so full of potential exploit that is incredible that someone is actually contemplating itread the following list ceo do a heavy campaing for recruiting increase tax and wardec corp with alt corp now player in the corp are locked in unless they pay concord and the ceo need only to keep his tax rate a bit under the cost of leaving the corp to keep them in or even better they have to pay the ceo alt corporation to leave the corp then there is the added joke that if you have a spy in your corporation when wardecced you will be incapable of ejecting him as he will not pay the concord fee to leave the corp i suspect that people with more devious mind that me will find other even more interesting way to exploit an idea like this
ah right thats what it was you are a devious man i like it
your kinda ed if you belive what you wrote herea fee while being at war is really stupid especially for 00 alliances that often times always have war decs and multiple at that
your supposed to be able to kick players from the corpif you cant then there should be that optionotherwise youll end up with a pile of people who refuse to leave to be an annoyance or worseas far as the exploits that entirely depends on the implementation of thatand i dont see anyone here making suggestions just criticizing it
you might want to read what you wrote before you say its stupid
exactly i think it is an awful idea and there is no way to make it valid so i will point the flaw in it tha ti notice no intention to do constructive criticism only destructive and thi is eve destruction is good
this suggestion is built on the false assumption that players are obligated to be vunlerable to war decsif invulnerablity was not supposed to be an option then game mechanics would allow you to declare wars against players in npc corpsbut that is not how the game is intended to workgame balance requires that players have a reasonable means of retreating from combat so that they can rebuild and prepare to mount a counter attack if the choose to do soto remove the option of retreat in eve would have the same net effect as permant death in short order you reach a point where your only option is to quit or start over that works great for first person shooters not so much for mmos
yes lets continue the destruction of eve oh wait you didnt mean that did you quip
but you have a conundrumthe greifers and people who actually wardec for fun as opposed to torture get shortchanged when people bail out in the middle of a wardec and hide behind an npc corpi dont think ccp intended for that to be the case aside from players opting out of such thingsall im trying to do is avoid the tax the carebears tripe and suggest that a penalty be issued to people who intentionally jump ship because of a wardecit allows them to hide as they wish but only if they pay the fineit dosent cut them off it doesnt shortchange the wardecing corp as that money could feasibly go to them as the greater majority demand ransomas far as a reasonable means of retreat there is no such thingthe idea of building a corp is to remain alive as suchto pull out in such a fashion is not exactly honorable and most dont give a rip about such a notion anyway they end up rebuilding or making a new corp or something to that effectthis is not to remove the option of retreat its just putting a price tag on it to make sure that some sort of compensation is given
exactlyi believe that the missile speeds are way too slow other ships are insta damage like they should as far as the well missiles dont miss or missiles do more damage missiles do not miss but that is assuming other ships havent popped it or it hasnt flown away since you launched them the damage is not a factor if the targets are moving since takes almost nothing to go faster than the explosion velocity at long distances turret ships do not suffer the tracking problems like they would close up they fire and hit caldari fire a missile and wait and wait and waitit is not uncommon for me to have 23 salvos of missiles in flight before first missile hits and that is if the missile speed is 8km a sec most the time the missiles have no target by the time they get therei know caldari have turret ships but how would other races like to have half of their ships removed because of an issue like this
i fly gallente ever try using a drone ship from 200 km away
only problem is that fcs often want everyone on the primary we use to target secondary targets but it has gotten to the point where everyone wants insta alpha strike damage that is what wins a fight right now which means no missile boats unless you are standing on top of the target
what is wrong with that do some math how long does it take a current missile to get 150kms at 85km a second 176 seconds so how many targets last 18 seconds unless there is a spider tank going you could only get 20kms if you put 23 rigs on your missile boat if the speed was doubled
missles are getting nurfed with the nano nurf  not buffed you are asking for the wrong thing at the worst time missles are an ok wepon system  but in fleet instant damage is key  any missle lag no matter how slight is a disadvantage in fleet  the solution is to train for the rokh or train another races battleship i would recommend amarr missle lag is here to stay missles are not gonna get faster they are gonna get slower so you best be planning for that
this is a stupid thread caldari has a very competent lineup of railboats and missiles are excellent  whether as closerange gank weapons or as longrange fleet antisupport toolsand if your target warps from the field well the entire point of shooting a ship is to remove it from the field as long as you dont attempt to shoot the fleet snipers primaries youll be fine
see if your caldari which are known for missile ships you need to train for another races ship or use a non missile caldari ship so like i said half of the caldari fleet is worthless unless your pos shooting or unless a capital ship is tackledthe point of removing a ship from fighting is just that blowing it up just because it warps off does not mean its out of the fightpeople can flame all they like what if someone told the other races that turret guns are no longer effective and they need to train caladri missile ships how would you like thatwhy have the race that is know for its missile ships only to make it so everyone needs to use guns that defeats the purpose of having that race
next time read before you post fcs are telling people in fleet for everyone to shoot the primary and many are now saying if your in a missile ship thanks but no thankslike i said either give the caldari more turret based ships or fix missiles since 12 of the ships now have little to no worth
so let me get this straight you are asking for a change because some fcs in your alliance is telling you to bring something else and you are having heart burn about it because you are a special snowflake
if your fcs are telling your specialised missile antisupport ships to shoot the snipers primaries rather than the enemy support then the problem is not missiles its your fcs
not just my alliance every fc from every alliance i have been in a fleet with
so what fcs have to work with the current lag prone environment we have to operate in no amount of doubling tripling the speed of missiles will make that much of a difference it still has the effect of not getting there when it should on the primaries it is what it is with missiles you have consistent damage always hit no tracking issues fire and forget no fall off no adjusting trajectory hits from 0 to max range optional damage types requires flight time to get to target with guns it hits immediately tracking issues variable damage falloff hits are chance based have to pay attention to trajectory distance and so on hybrids have no optional damage types need to change ammo to increase range or increase damage amaar has no reloading variable ammo minmi has low dps but high alpha so there is your trade off e plus the rohk is one of the best snipers in the game
sounds like someone forgot about explosion velocity take away from damage or explosion radius the effect is even larger against faster ships in a fleet fight it doesnt take much to negate the damage of a missileyes the rokh is a decent ship but the cost is sky high
missiles have their high points too like the lack of tracking that allows a raven to shoot down a frigate no mater how fast theyre going unless they break 6 kmbuying a rohk is a much better solution than making missiles overpowered again
your knit picking now and looking for an easy buttonwhy in the world would any one fire cruise or heavies at a ceptor in a fleet battle why you wouldnt cruise and heavies are reserved for cruiserbattle cruiser targets ie bbs caracals canes falcons etc when you are in the support you should have a priority of targets on your overview based on what your ship and weapon systems can handle and the most effective and as far as the rohk being sky high well yea but its insurable and you get most of your cash back i have seen the rohk in 00 any where from 135 to 180 it depends on where you shop and if you have buddies that can build you one all it takes is a bit of effort on your part to have one built or build one your self
you see much drone boat or blaster boat in fleet operations here it go half of the gallente fleet for exactly the same reason and we dont even have a good ewar ship
complaining that the raven is not a very good sniper when you have access to the rokh is like complaining that you cant open a bottle with a cigarette lighter when theres a bottle opener sitting right next to youyou seem to be under the impression that half your ships being suboptimal for a particular type of combat is a bad thing how stupid would it be if every ship was good at everything
i am all for such an option ifand there it startsif there are realistic market fluctuations to both stock value and dividendsthat means that your shares may end up being worthless literally stock exchange is not a safe money maker if it was everyone would buy shares all the timeeventually it is not worth the effort to implement yet
the problem here is that it would help most the people who need isk the least whilst fueling inflation
how about the aggression flag being set on for all fleet members in same systemif a pilot joins in that fleet after the aggression no aggression flag
what gave you the impression that only sf cared about the various fw proposals in most cases i saw support from numerous people representing many corps or alliances both inside and outside of fw one of my biggest issues is granting access in some manner to fw to pilots in alliances i appreciate having members of the csm support this issue one which is supported heavily by a wide variety of rp alliances on both sides of the war including corps in fw 17tw ks heretics pie and alliances not yet in fw cva vv uk em to name just a fewgiven that fw issues affects around 20k participants and includes the interests of thousands more nonparticipants how is it abusive or corrupt to represent the wishes of such a large constituency also given that star fraction have positioned themselves as hostile toward all four factions how do you imagine that any mechanics improving fw would benefit them in any way except possibly to generate more interest in fw and therefore expand their target baseim not sure exactly what your issue is but whatever it is consider itunsigned
i dont remember the tally of the exact vote but iirc the entire council was behind allowing alliances into fw

i had an old character i maxed out all the learning skills and i didnt see it as a long time now i have a new character and if there were no learning skills it would take me twice as long to get to get to flying a bs with the necessary support skillsthe longer you are looking at playing the game for the more learning skills you want not less
if you are going to talk about this know that ccp nozh has already looked some into this issue at increasing their hp see the 7 page thread by vily in features  ideas so please talk about a veloctiy bonus andor an explosion bonus for citadels torps while in seige
id like to shake your hand good sir to add there is a lengthy thread somewhere on the forums that includes some kind of 3d modeling that is a proposal on how to make poses more attractive it had everything interconnected like the international space station quite impressive add that in so were not staring at ty space sticks thanks 
hello alleve is a game about economy since we cant create planned obselescence there has to be another way for items to be replaced we cant rely on technology as merely placing a new type of ship in this game requires a boatload of thought from concept to art to balance to coding to modifying the live serverspvp is rough in this game and i have been on both sides of the gun i dont like gankingsuicide gankinggatecamping but its a part of the game i enjoy playing and i wouldnt have it any other wayim not saying that pvp in this game is ideal or perfect but any game is going to have some flaws im bidding for a seat in the csm so i can help people with the game ive played for so many years nowthis is a true sandbox game and as with a realworld sandbox there are always going to be bullies and wimps the people who make the sand castle and the people who kick it to see somebody cry pvp flags would destroy this game as would most other let me play in peace ideas as a mmo you will interact with the community in one fashion or another whether salvagecan thieves in missions gatecampers in lowsec selling items on the market etcas the poster above me stated this is eve everybody vs everybody as such it should not and in fact cannot be changed without rewriting or destroying the eve we all play
my sixpence and im new tot he game would be that players are given a panic buttonthis button will alert online members in their corperation that they are under attacknot only will this be a revenue oppotunity for the crop because they could set a charge for every time they bail you out of trouble but it will also make pirating that little more risk when picking on that defencless miner and what not 2 mins into the fight you get 10 people wishfull thinking from their corps show up who are willing to pvplets see how good you really are but im a hauler i appreicate the risks and i accept them thats life it aint fair and bigger dogs will always want to show there top by picking on the lower ones but it would be nice to have a distress systemediti have since spoken with some folk who say that what the corp channel is for but it would be far simpler to hit one button that tells folk your location and whats hitting you than it would to type out you need help where you are and whats attacking you
contit would also mean technology can be created to scramble raido channels to provent distress callsjust a thought
 opi have a idea which would be best for all involved partysquit eve and go back to playing wowthxhave a good day
so you see a drop in alt accounts so it will affect evethough to what end who knows
on the other hand eve is largely paid for in foreign currencies and the krona has taken a divereherschel yamamotoi would say evemail me in game but i am not in game much i can explain pretty well how the crisis originated how it progressed and why large effects were missed it would go way over the limits here though and isnt really appropriate for an eve forum
oh im familiar with why it happened but like you im trying not to go too deep into rl economic analysis on an internet spaceship forum
i would actually like your input in this i hear that iceland may register the first national bankruptcy and id like to know other economicallyinterested peoples inputs please feel free to convo me or evemail me at your conveniencealso if youre running i look forward to a good political campaign last time i think we were pretty much neckandneck at the finish line although not in the top running

the age limit is being held for csm ii and will be implemented in csm iii
to me were talking about two things herea how ideas are put on the csm agendab what do csm members think about the ideaid prefer a neutral system for putting up ideas on the agenda in stead of a csm member having to support it no definite idea here btw something like a fixed number of support votes perhapsafter its put online of course the opinion of the csm members decides if it should be passed to ccpwhysome items float for a long time without any acknowledgment or support from a csm member i assume this is because no csm member supports that idea this of course is their right but if it would come to a vote at least wed see the argumentation behind the opinion and thus the votenow all i can do is think well maybe they havent looked at it yet
that methodology exists today if a portion of the playerbase expresses support for an issue by voting on it in the assembly hall the csm has no choice but to address the issue the problem is that the current percentage is a bit unrealistictheyve significantly lowered the number for the next csm
actually im quite surprised at ccp and their willingness to follow the csms suggestions i didnt think theyd have the understanding that they currently have nor the force of change theyre willing to give for these changesfrom following the assembly hall discussions for the past 34 months ive noticed that a lot of issues that had raised concern are suddenly getting the spotlight they deserved although i cant say whether this was planned or not issues such as the linuxmac problems the industrial expansion midas suicide ganking and others are getting a spotlight i didnt think would happen for many monthskudos to ccp and keep up the good work likewise kudos to many members of the last csm for getting these issues to the attention of the devs i only hope i can fill the shoes that may be left open adequately

broad nerfs dont balance gamesinvincibe nanoships explode by the hundreds every day i try to make sure that im responsible for a bunch of those i cant get behind anything that takes away all of the satisfaction of making an extremely challenging tackle and podding an 800m isk implant set eve is all about buying performance and then losing your investment to a tiny mistake dont change that
me is against
im fully against the nano nerf speed makes this game fun and excessive speed makes it awesomewith that said totally raping minmatar by doing both a nano nerf and a web nerf will make the rapier about as useful as an assfrig
againstsuch a heavy handed nerf dumbs down one of the few aspects of the game that requires more skill than f1f8 actually flying a ship thats paper thin and worth a significant amount of isk there are numerous ways to counter fast ships if you apply yourself to pvp and dont expect it to be the same as shooting npcs a tackling frigate and a t1 fit blackbird is all it takes to counter a nano ship
nice idea shame it doesnt work too well when the vaga starts going over 14kms i am against this entire thread
im against your posting
original thread in game development forum
i dunno what the g15 is capable of but i know that wow accounts of people using a g15 have been banned why is this
all it has is a little display for text
but havent you thought of the consequences of that it would rock eves foundation to its core
there used to be third party support that showed amount of ammo etc iirc just google for it
good luck lv
it will still be a bad move in round 3maybe we need to elect an extra 18 year old in round 2 who will be able to stand again in round 3 so that we can have this debate all over again

the following is a combined proposal which is more specific and on a smaller scale than what i usually prefer to deal with but i thought it was neat im submitting this on behalf of my brosef vio geraci and have credited the necessary inspirationalcontributive minds at the bottom this is mostly a braindump intended to stimulate discussion and it would be cleaned up before being finally issuedconcepta pirate base structure that is launched at a safespot and is designed to be deployed offensively and allowing one to refitstore loot covert pos maybe it would not be scannable or probeable and would have a shield that prevented things within radius from being probed out perhaps by cloaking anything within that radius no defenses per say but also not findable except via infiltration meta gaming or if it goes offline due to fuel issues perhaps one can probe it out during a half hour period each day as it refuelslunacythis is less dumb than it sounds theres nothing radically unfair about being able to refit and hide lootreload the problem i can think of is people would deploy these in their own territory and then just leave their ships there rather than at pos as they do maybe this isnt that bad a problem or maybe have the cloaking shield only extend 5km and have it eject unpiloted shipscans in a manner similar to some pos which are then scannable and potentially compromise the baselimitsmaking a cloaking radius very small will limit the number of ships that can hide in it and also make it possible for a ship to drift outside of it by accident allowing the base to be probed out the radius would have to be small enough to prevent entire fleets and especially capitals from hiding there perhaps 500m perhaps warping to one of these bases would stop you 500m away from the shield in a manner similar to pos shields so that there is a small window in which to probe people out and adding risk whenever they are usedstorage capabilitiesmake its storage capacity small perhaps around the size of a carriers cargo space definitely not big enough to store pos parts this isnt a covert offensive staging facility so much as a base for prolonged griefing operations perhaps make it impossible to anchor them in sov 4 systems perhaps limit the kind of things that can be stored in themdestroying itin concept it would be killable via metagame espionage lack of fuel or carelessness like maybe ships cant idle at it too long perhaps it needs to be refueled daily so it is imprudent to maintain too many of these at once or perhaps it would only need a small amount of fuel but it would have to be manually moved each dayadvantagesadvantages include enabling asymmetrical warfare offering incentives for corps or operating groups to be smaller and thus less vulnerable to espionage more fun things to spend money on and build more places to fight that arent a pos or station more fun anchorable structures it also would allow ships hiding at it to not cripple their setups by fitting a cloak i believe most of the mechanics for this are already in the game and so this would not be an undue strain upon ccp manhourscredit for inspirationsuggestions jade constantine darius im very busy johnson daveydweeb vio geraci
that would be devious but very cooli would also like to think such a thing could be use not just at a safe spot but elsewherehowever you need to clearly indicate the definition of a safespotand what of standard pos spots could you deploy such a thing thereand would you be able to set up the usual pos equipment as well observing the limitations of course
i believe the concept to be essentially an unprobeable forward base for small gang griefing in enemy territory as such simply anchoring them to moons as per a normal pos would be unacceptable im thinking more along the lines of it being an anchorable cloaking container with a decently sized field so your gang can store your  in it while raiding hostile turfno pos equipmentedit although some form of covert cyno beacon would be p cool
this might be exactly the sort of thing that guerrilla warfare needs the covert cyno gen off a covert station in enemy territory would be even cooler supported
this is awesome vio is awesome
the only issue i have is the defition of a safespot would have to be some sort of area defined clearly with boundries to prevent abuseso perhaps anything in empty space with a surounding radius of nothing for 2 to 3aus minimumcall it a shot in the dark but if you could clearly indicate the limit that would be greatas far as what kind of equipment i was only thinking of hidden hangers and what not but yeah im good for itps nice to see the professional and rational side of the goons i may have misjudged you not all goons are alike it would seem nice work darius nice worksigned
good idea but needs alot of work supportededit reread your post and noticed my idea was actually your idea d
to stop people from deploying from within their own territory you could make it so it can only be deployed in constellations that are owned by a wartarget of yours soon as the war ends or soveignty changes the cloak drops and theyre probeable
this would be silly since 00 powers rarely formally wardec each other while actually fighting
its the kernel of a pretty good idea what id say though is that the covert cyno generator would be overpowered as well as devaluing the black ops bs if people want to generate covert cynos make them insert the right ship
naw people would just abuse this with an alt alliance claming sov with a mutual wardec thensounds like it would add a nice new mechanic to the game thou
overall this is a pretty clever concept i would not tie deployment to wardecs because id hate to see that mechanic have utility beyond empire that also limits the ability to use these in metagaming eg to deploy them in territory of an ally to double cross themotoh tying the utility of this to offensive operations is better instead of wardecs perhaps they should be cloaked only when deployed in systems of different sovereignty if sovereignty changes all newly friendly ninjaposes decloak and appear on scanner to anyone
sounds like a good way to add a bit of intrigue and surprise to the current predictability of fightsbeing able to conceal numbers as well as give hidden basesi would make these things have a glass jaw where 5km smartbombs stealth bomber bombs and even doomsdays would reveal or quickly destroy these structures it would make those using these have to be extra cautious in that you dont always need a covops to foil these basesit just helps a lot
i think you should be able to get 10 people at this just like the number of people able to refit at a carrier
have kicked around the idea several times myself by any measure would make the game more interesting kind of disappointing that the only means of offline presence so far is outposts its like a right of existenceinalienable rights yeah thats the stuff
this is a good idea but it still hurts my favorite form of pvp defense gangs
i would love this kind of stuff from my own personal play stylebut i have a concern about a thing which is designed so that there must be metagaming in order to destroycounter itso im really not sure what to think of thisisnt it going to make the griefing that happens with people who sit cloaked in a system for hours scaring ratters away i personally think its a valid playstyle but people are going to whine about it and this will decrease the barrier to entry for doing it
i would like to see the fuel capacity max 14 days for example but seperate cloaking fuel max capacity 24 hoursno stront so if its allowed to go uncloaked its destroyable immediatelyand make it faction only with fitting variatins depending onfaction maybe even unique abilities per faction and reasonably expensive
i was part of the early discussion on this after weighing the pros and cons im personally against the idea of the base generating a cloaking field for nearby ships unless theres some mechanism to prevent permanent afkcloaking if you want to do that simply fit a cloak on your ship also i like the idea of being able to probe out the base via ships while its being used and refueled one thing not specifically mentioned above is the base has obvious pve uses as well  to rat and explore in hostile space in terms of storage capacity i think a proper size would be roughly that of a gsc 3900 m3
the idea that was tossed around and wasnt perhaps clear enough in the proposal is that the anchorable would be vulnerable periodically perhaps during a refueling cycle that must happen daily or when a ship dips outside the shields then the structure can be probed the intent was for metagaming to be a way to find it but certainly not the only waypeople will whine about virtually any proposal a lot of people seem to want to play a game in which theyre completely invincible that game isnt eve and when youre playing a cut throat game someone is always going to be unhappy that is inherent in the designto further add to the statement regarding people sitting cloaked in a system for hours so what its a perfectly valid play mechanic and im really not all that concerned about people complaining about the way people choose to play a game within the rules some people flat out dont like cloaks others dont like speed its the nature of the beast
one reason im being careful with fuel is that the target audience for this is smaller gangs and smaller ships it needs to be designed in such a way that the fuel capacity is not such that some crazy ship is needed to keep it running perhaps an additional use for the deep space transports
mechanic suggestionfielded at lagrange points and can be decloaked you can put it anywhere on the grid with one caveat if you put it smack in the middle it will be anchored solidly if you put it 200km away within a few hours it will spiral out of stable orbit and destruct into the sun aka despawn with all your stuff and your clone in ityou can redeploy it back towards the center of the grid periodically should you chose or just let it float off if you need you can put it dead center in some backwater system if you need an emergency logoff spot or a safe stashthis way there is a reliable albeit tedious way to sweep your entire system of enemy structures or at least get the ones that arent being managed activelyat the same time pilots can adapt the placement to meet their needs they can make it not worth tracking down but higher maintenance or they can make it semipermanent but easy to track down if somebodys lookingmake the lagrang points show up in solar system browser and let that be the end of itas far as size itd be nice to see a few versions for different needs there should definitely be one that fits inside a blockade runner with room for loot to spare that can house several ships sounds like were talking about basically a cloaked tent of sorts much more compact than the ships and goods it storesjust tacking on some more ideas but say the black ops get ability to sling deep space transports around have one sized appropriately for a gang doing that sort of thing
i really liked this idea when i read it in jades blog yes i read the whole thing a suggestion would be perhaps you would have to switch off the cloak temporarily in order to enter or leave it and risk it getting found out so entering it thus making it difficult to find but not impossible not that im totally against metagaming but i dont think it should be the sole tactic for a ruse plus forcing people to overcome an obstacle by having to metagame will create a lot of detractors to what is an excellent idea
hell yes deep space transporters are much needed
if the concern is how you would get access to it think of how a normal secret base works if you never use it its virtually impossible to find but if youve got a small city moving in and out every day its obvious theyre found by traffic analysis not by searching every square inch of the planet make it so that use of the base is what allows it to be found  say it takes a few minutes for the cloak to cover each new ship if you only go there once a day its safe but if you base a fleet out of it then any fool with a scan probe will find it easilyjade has a blog link please
now this is the kind of ideas we need to help bring some fun back into the game again just keep it simple fewer moving parts means less  can go wrong with it
yeh that part seemed like an afterthought when i read it something that makes it probeable would be cool but i wouldnt leave it wholly out of player control when the cloak goes offline
his blog for the csm campaign jaysus
i like the idea
thats largely because vio wanted the thing that way and i pretty much flat out copied and pasted what he said ill edit as ideas bubble up in thsi thread to reflect things better
i agree and therefore it doesnt need to stick to the std fuel typescosts we see in sov claiming towers no reason why a full 2 weeks fuel shouldnt fit into a 5 black ops bs cargo holds and the cloaking fuel be something again small but expenxivemaybe a new set of fuels could be created made from the pos reactions that industrialists do thus making new in in game content for those guys alsoi like this idea but i do not like the ability for people to sit within it cloaked this is part of my belief that cloaks should cost fuel to run and therefore be limited in cloaking time overall stored ships cloaked good small gangs cloaked wthout having to fit cloaks not so goodalthough could be funny if one is scanned down just outside cloak range and a defensive fleet of hics are on the scene to lock everyone sat inside down
theres also the possibility of the structure simply running out of gas and needing to be replaced but im still up in the air as far as fuelonlining issues i am leaning towards herschels idea though regarding the probability being directly proportionate to the number of ships inside
this sounds awesome something that any smallgangcorp could use to their advantage
im opposed to fueling any structures in general the idea is to make it require some upkeep and player interaction fueling makes it require harvesting ice etc and there are already too many things that make this game feel like work give it a timer no need to have some fueling system to hide the fact that its a timer if you really need to hide it thats why i came up with the lagrange point idea 
oh what ushrakhan could do with these i like the idea but to be honest i think theres balance issues depending on the drawbacks you build into the design it becomes an invulnerable base or a worthless hunk of debris i cant see much in the way of middle ground unfortunatelydefinitely something worth thinking about though
maybe instead of fuel cause continual damage to the structure based on the mass of ships within its cloak radius more ship mass  more strain on the cloaking field prevent it from being repaired while anchored give it a 1020 minute anchoring and unanchoring delay as well finally only allow noncapital ships to refit at itthe massbased degradation will reduce its viability for concealing a large gang for a long period of time but still allow it to be used for that purpose in a desperate situation the degradation rate would be tricky to get right but i think the massbased method simplifies the processthe degradationwhileused system prevents the need for tedious fueling while simultaneously providing a limit to use and an incentive to spend some time out of the bubble it also allows use of the station as a longterm rally point as it will only degrade while being actively usedthe anchoringunanchoring delay and the inability to repair it while anchored creates a window of opportunity for attack the window increasing in frequency the more the structure is used due to the degradationthe no capitals restriction will stop capitals from using it as an emergency cloakfitting stop also the huge mass of capital ships would cause the structure to melt like the wicked witchi think this is a good compromise between all the points of contention brought up but i may have missed some thoughts
oh god please no more fueling and anchoring bull it is designed for a small group so lets make it easy to use shall wei would change itpirate base is only anchorable by black opslasts for 14 days then explodes no fuelblack ops able to cynoportal to each pirate base like a covert cyno generatori like the 500m cloaking radius so that blobs cannot use it effectivelythumbs up from me
yep
this is a good idea
fueling and transportation are an important part of the game man they arent going to just phase it out and this is something that would obviously require fuel that said your idea about a finite duration would probably work as wellit would be kind of neat to be able to generate a blackops cyno network inside of your enemies territory im not sure it would be unbalanced either the local inhabitants can already move any ship around willynilly so why shouldnt hostiles be able to move their stealth bombers and what have you around with a similar degree of effectiveness
i like this you deploy it and after 14 days it disintegrates
i like the idea especially if a new reaction is needed to fuel the station if you pop a hauler full of the stuff youll know to wait while they send for another itd make the station easier to probe out especially if the shield drops while refuelingsince its basically a gsc with a small cloaking field designed to be deployed in hostile space i think it should be able to run for two or three days without needing an outside source of fuelas far as cloaking nearby ships goes i think the field should be able to hold at most a haulersized ship or a few frigates which should be able to afkthat lagrange point idea someone posted is awfuli like the idea of a twoweek disposable covert pos though
this is a p good idea and would make 00 warfare a bit more funexciting im assuming itd be possible to anchor these in mission running lowsec systems as well i do think a maximum on how many of these can be in a system is a good idea either a hardcap of say 5 or something a bit more complex like the inability to anchor the structure if its in a certain range of another object for example another pirate base either yours or someone elses may interfere with its ability to online perhaps it cant be anchored too close to a planetmoongate either alternatively it has to be anchored within a certain range of a planet with only one per planet allowed granted this would make them a bit easier to probe outdont mind me im just thinking as i type here
my concern in this case is that friendly alliances would occupy all of the available space to prevent hostiles from taking advantage of these
was thinking about the aspect of probing the thing out what if you could probe this thing out in the same way you do with exploration sites but make it alot less precise and require multiple probes across the whole system gradually triangulating the spot down until you got within a maximum of say 150km this would take time and a whole lot of effort too do maybe increasing the time needed to run scan probes significantly youd then end up with a hit that you could observe the surrounding space fromwould be like fishing you sit there in your covops somewhere within 150km you know there is one of these things you wait for those few seconds when a ship appears from or goes into the hidden base as it comes in or out of warp if you blink you might miss it but if you dont youve found the bastards now
anything that allowed them to be probed out no matter how arduous without the users of the pirate bases screwing up in some way would make these useless for asymmetrical warfare that is smaller groups waging war against larger groups
this idea is in the same vein as small anchorables which has already been escalated and replies given from ccpi cant support something entering enemy territory that is essentially unfindable if its unprobable its unfindable a place for ships to hide etc its ripe grounds for unbalancing warfare massively in favour of the agressors i can see uses that would go beyond small corpsgangs eg anchor a few in one system or in neighbouring systems hide x ships at each safe building up of a large force that cant be found then attack with a large fleet that was undetectableif its gonna enter the game it should have realistic mechanics that are congruent with other features being unprobable isnttake carearithron
so true
ok say you incorporated my idea into the probing ideals of the op you can only do this at certain times maybe during the 30minutes of refueling maybe you could make it more susceptible to probing the more ships are hiding in it the more strain the cloak is under the closer hit your probes would get say the closest would be 100km furthest could be 5000km this means that if you have a pirate base that people are using constantly the more risk you have of being triangulatedi think the best part of this comes down to the fact you have to finally pinpoint this thing by eye you gotta judge exactly where you saw something come out of it and then fly towards that spot you misjudge it you could fly right past it by you bring people in to sweep the area the guys inside get to sit there and wait watching people buzz about looking for them getting ready to defend or ambush the hunters
this is a great idea as long as there are mechanics that make it useful for small gangs without making it useful for large fleets i support this
player interaction wether its f1f8 or fuelling poses wether its mundane or exciting is the backbone of eveeve isnt free it takes effort co ordination time to achive anyhting timers defeat that fundemantal ideal imho
wow something new creative and cool with a dash of wtf sneakinessi like it
sounds good but needs much more storage space i can fill a carriers cargo worth of loot in no time the cargo size works if youre using it as a forward pvp base but as a ninjaratting hq it needs much more otherwise it sounds good
mundane shouldnt be the backbone of anything im paying for as a service pos fueling isthe most player interaction ive ever had with logistics is helping corp mine icetheres enough coordination to be had with just getting all the goods together for pvp ops out in deep space ships are a disposable we dont really need more disposables especially ones that dont contribute to why we play the gameyou mine ice throw it in a rabbit hole its gone that is the reality of fuel countless podpilothours of eve are spent moving gas from production sources to sinks with no higher purpose sure theres a market but everything that can be produced has a marketmoar ships moar pew pew no more gas
from a mechanics standpoint even if it was reasonable to allow jump freighters to jump into high sec the implementation would be problematic as fuze indirectly pointed out the main reason jump freighters are unable to do so is that cyno fields themselves are banned in high sec not jfs which can enter but only via gates basically highsec has cynojammers in every system from a flavortext standpoint it makes a lot more sense for the empires to simply cynojam every system to prevent foreign capitals to jump in than to find a way to prevent only capital ships from jumping to a cyno field in their spaceas an aside the events leading up to fw show that it is possible to bypass the empire cynojammers but that technology is not available to podpilots
tired of the russians popping you at your favorite lowsec cyno point eh
i cant believe i just read the entire thread and the only good point made in this failure of a thread was by treelox noyou should never fly anything you cant afford to lose whether it be a shuttle or a titan i care not failthread fails
why not undock  warp to zero on gate  jump  no riskundock cyno into highsec  no riskits not making one jot of difference in the risk to the pilot but will save a lot of tedious jumpingaping through high secskunk
skunk is correct on that risk now is allready very low however since we are apparently removing boring stuff why not also give normal freighters ability to jump between high sec systems otherwise it is boring and how about you just start a lvl 4 mission and you get 20m isk without the need to do anything
saves them time sifting the wheat from the chaff
well im glad this is a contentious topic  always more interesting debatedarius point about the csm not having influence over the forum mods is correct afaik but that doesnt stop the csm being given the ability to take action on forum banningsthe interesting risk again by darius is that a majority council could effectively warreport a fellowcsm member they wanted kicked out think threadnought with reports at the risk being forum banned themselves for repeatedly reporting posts that didnt deserve it however that would be a neutral action as the warreporting majority wouldnt vote one of their own out of the council on the otherhand the warreporting csm would also be unable to communicate or do further reports the only way i can think to counter that is to simply remove a banned persons right to vote and let alternates step up as alternates are sequential this can also be gamed ideas
so it looks like the problem is that the csm members dont want to discuss issues in advance not the means for doing so unfortunate but woefully common in groups like this  people think im slightly mad when i mail reports out in advance of the meeting so people will have time to read them at their leisure when thats just simple good practice meetings of more than five people cannot easily contain a useful discussion so you do the thinking and discussing in advance and use the meetings for voting plus some qa and hashing out issues you want to discuss in real timeof which there are a few but the idea of a simple issue known and posted on forums a week in advance being discussed for the first time at the meeting itself is utter insanity i am wholly unsurprised by how long your meetings take use yahoo groups next time or something similar lets you keep a mailing list up longterm so future councils can use it without it being one individuals domain
it does stop the csm from being able to act on forum bannings as you have no way of knowing its occurred and ccp will not communicate them to you since the csm is not in a position to question this policy nor any other forum policy then effectively this topic is moot if im a jerk who doesnt want to be removed from the council i simply wont tell you and because of the above items youll never knowinterestingly enough being banned also prevents you from being able to apply for the council in the first placepersonally i dont believe the csm should be in a position of further empowering lowlevel divisions within ccp with undue influence over the selection process i believe that to be specifically against the nature of the council in the first place any division of ccp having influence over the makeup of the council without itself being subject to any oversight can lead to the same type of situations which the council was formed to preventultimately while i like the idea of standards i believe theyre already being applied and leaving the decision in the hands of a moderation team who has already placed themselves outside of the process is a pretty daft thing to do
darius was a moron and went and got himself temp banned and this is jade constantines pathetic attempt at what he no doubt imagines to be cunning subterfugevoting no i dont want csm members to be removed at the caprice of the forum mods
yeah great idea dont deal with the reason of the ban itself just trust forum moderators to decide who is and isnt fit to serve as a csmnot only do i not support this ill go as far as to say that anyone who does support this should be ashamed of themselves
why are we even discussing this what problem does removing a csm over some temp ban handed out by the forum moderationgm staff solve why would someone being temp banned on the forums mean that they have any less community support than they had when they were elected and even if they did why would that matter they were rightfully elected in the first place right
for the recorddarius was banned in a thread for slap fighting with jade constantine unlike jade his arguments didnt devolve to personal attacks jade wasnt banned for some stupid reason and as you can see darius posting it was a temp bani dont think forum mods should have any power be it moderation over csm members i also dont think if you have had a temp ban prior you are unable to run for csm right now you can get banned for anything during the t20 scandal many people were banned after the threadnaught you can bet if a gm or dev did the same misconduct there would be another threadnaught or perhaps forums mod and that would be justified the forum rules arent always correct and people in power arent always nonpartisanhellachicken
this is adding more fluff where we dont need it the unnecessary complications arent worthwhilethat and it puts power over csm delegates from people who shouldnt really be involved in the process
this would be done with altsdrop it you are already prohibited from running when you have a forum ban in effect such there is no reason to allow candidates and representatives to be open to such attacks
signed
thumbs downthe csm and the forum mods are two separate entities by design
no thanks
no support this is an unecessary extension of power to forum mods in an arena they dont belong in it only has value if youre looking for a new way to game the system
ccp moderation team should have no power of who is isnt on the csm this would set a horrible president espcially with the level of meta gaming in todays eve
i look forward to abusing the  out of this
so far this just seems to be another example of just how useless the whole csm turned out to be thanks for this
this is stupid youd be taking my vote away by putting the decision of who is in the csm in the hands of the moderation team and people i did not necessarily vote for
ahahahahahahahahahahahahaa permanent ingame ban on all of your accounts should be grounds for csm dismissal nothing less
there are a couple things ppl seem to forgetthe csm was founded following some rather stupid actions on ccps partsooooo if csm can be banned at the discretion of the moderation team then the whole thing is just a silly stuntseeing how the csm is elected by the players the removal should also be in the hands of the players ok say he broke the rules in this special case being a csm member things could go through a different process than for a regular joe imho they should allow some sort of player controll before removala vote by the other csm membersa players votesome sort of mechanism to put the power back in the hands of the players and not in ccps untrustworthy team againi vote no
how about no
wow look at that poorly veiled attempted to get bane and dj kicked from the csm and stop any member of goonswarm every standing again so that certain parties can have their faux influence over ccp and suggest yet more meaningly crap in the name of a free trip to icelandon top of that would then put the make up of the csm in the hands of ccp forum moderators and gm which of course have no vendettas against inderviduals or corpsalliances since they are totally impartialwhy not just come out and say it you dont want abrasive people who think differently to you in your little circle jerk as it means you might have to oh god debate things rather than just act as a rubber stamp for solutions to problems that dont existthe csm is about as ligitmate and has as much control over eve as the east german government did and their icelandic masters are just pulling the strings behind the illusion of allowing the players to have a say on what gets broken nextwith this in mind i am going to say no
this is a horribly veiled attempt by jade constantine to get darius kicked off the csm nothing more nothing less if the moderators had one ounce of intelligence theyd lock this thread
forum moderation is inconsistent this would be too dnw
this is an excellent ideano it isnt
no forum bans and ingame bans are two separate things
unfortunately eveo moderators suck hard this just cant workingame bans now thats a different thing
this would be a pretty effective tool for ccp themselves to remove people they are finding a pain in the arse from the csm system a csm member would then have to be afraid of voicing any opinion of the player base because the mods could find one silly rule forum ban you and then you lose csm yes this is serious tinfoil but it is something you would need to take into accountletting the csm council vote anyone they feel like off after a forum ban is also stupid games of goading eachother into saying stupid things on the forum like earlier in this term just to have a power bloc vote them off could become an issue players voted them there for a reason and they should stay therea definate no to this stupid idea you clearly didnt think this through jesus
so if two people are banned for the same offence which implies the sort of constancy in the current moderation team that we know isnt there then both will come up for a vote in the csm team that vote will then be decided by whether the majority of the csm sees it as advantageous to ban someone they disagree withplease dont pretend that the current csm would not use it as a chance to opress the minority that is the whole point of this motion in the first placethe members are democratically elected by the player base it is not for a democratic body to alter its own makeup so as to affect the results of an election after all its only been a couple of thousand years and change in which it has been said that delegatus non potest delegatur the delegates may not themselves delegate
jade stop trying to use your little cats paw serenity to help you alter the makeup of the csmlike the bulk of those posting i disagree with this transparent attempt at electionstealing fortunately theres not a slugs chance in a furnace of ccp being stupid enough to fall for this ridiculously childish play they know it would stand a chance of further devaluing an institution that they must be desperate to see rid of its dramaqueen hijacker of a chairthing
no this kind of policy would only make things worse as it would open up another place for the csms to slapfight whether its people targeting goons goons targeting others or random other parties on each other the players would not be well served
i think its probably fair enough that a temp banned csm delegate gets tempreplaced with an alternate according to the previously established tally of voting so if x delegate got a 1 week ban he or she would be replaced as a voting member by the next alternate for the duration of the ban if it was a permaban then theyd obviously need to be permanently replaced now the problem is that the moderators might not like to share the status of the ban upon another player for privacy reasons and such  so the csm would need some way of ensuring it was correctly kept up to date on the ban status of its members perhaps it could be added to the csm signup docs that the delegates agree to do their best to avoid forum disciplinary action and give their permission for the csm officers to be informed about potential forum bans and suchliketo the few dozen identical posters in the thread above id say dont personalize this  its going to be something that does come up in future csms and the delegates need a way to resolve the situation
i have real concerns about the demonstrated inconsistency of the moderation team and the potential for abuse as outlined by darius and serenityvoting noedit rather id vote no had i the option what sort of poll is this
if these kinds of well thought out topics is what the csm spent their time on i ask for csm to be dissolved and new sol nodes be bought with the money saved from it
csm people trying to metagame other csms into being banned should be removed from the csmi mean come on this is probably the most transparent csm powerplay to date serenity well done on completely hosing what was left of your public image we now know whose music youre dancing to
prince of lies
cut it out already the csm was not put into place to be some venue for you to larp an intergalactic douchebagdo you remember one of the original reasons for csms it was put into place as a response to outcry against one of ccps employees being caught cheating the initial response to which was mass bannings from the former moderation team under that light dont you think this law might create somewhat of a conflict of interest
resolve what problem
this is dumb ban op close thread
no because that would mean that ccp is choosing the reps instead of the players
no the forum and the game are independent if each other id go so far as to say that a banned csm member is not banned from the csm forums as one is more important than the others netiquette is independent from knowledge of this game dont try and make one about the other
this idea allows a body that has no ties to the csm or input from the player base to effectively nominate csm members for removali see no logic behind allowing this course of action and thus cannot give it any support whatsoever i strongly encourage my fellow players to do the same
furthermorejade constantine
the assembly hall is not an excuse for flaming and personal attacks and id like to ask the goonswarm posters in this thread to stop it immediately it should be possible to debate and even disagree without the need to be openly abusive towards other eve players
i dont like or trust ccps forum moderation policies especially the way we arent allowed to discuss them i loathe this idea
weakkneed pubbies should not be able to remove our ceo from the council
were roleplaying being goons here so stop raining on everyones parade
the assembly hall is not an excuse to ignore debatei ask again what problem
what a ridiculous suggestioni mean seriously ridiculoushow does your ability to refrain from breaking forum rules directly effect your ability to shape the game into something that is better than it currently isknowing you jade i would bet everything i own that this is some sort of personally motivated bullsht to get something you want than about any real concernwhich csm members are currently banned which of them is the person you dont likebewildering
the csm should be more like 00 itself if you cant stand the pressure go back to jita or in this case caod
point is you dont know me eddz you dont know anybody who hasnt taken the time or inclination to get to know you in return this is a computer game with thousands of players  there is a limit to your understanding of other participants and assuming you know everything there is to know about another player always leads to misunderstanding and bad feelings and this is why its always a bad idea to personalize these assembly hall issues as far as i know or have been informed as csm chair  currently no csm delegates are forum banned
if i didnt want my csm delegates to act like goons i wouldnt have voted for goons in the first place this proposal effectively disenfranchises people like usthere is a kernel of truth to the original idea  there are some ingame behaviors such as blatantly using exploits that ought to disqualify someone for csm membership these forums however are far too meaningless to justify any such action
this is a dumb ideaedit of crap i hope i dont get tempbanned for this pointless post or else i will never be able to run for csm by the might of jade spare me oh omnipotent moderators
we should kick all people of the csm its a complete waste of time
as far as i know the csm chairs job is to schedule meetings i have no idea why youd be informed in any way ever of anything other than heres a topic id like to propose or hey i wont make it to the meeting this weekedit asking goons not to post is pretty silly they have just as much of a right to voice their opinion as anyone else including you
ccp forum enforcement should not override popular vote especially with the rolling alternate system of replacementthis proposal puts even the csm member with the greatest electoral mandate ie the most player votes at the risk of any forum enforcement  no matter what forum and with no reliably objective standard of conductthe next in line alternate system aggravates the problem consider this example joe repro is elected to csm with a huge plurality of player votes heshe gets into a random flame war on the science and industry forum and is temp banned now in addition to the forum ban penalty which may only be for cooling off joe loses his csm seat more importantly that huge segment of voting players loses its representation in favor of some other guy for whom far fewer players voted the potential for disenfranchisement is enormousforum misconduct requires suitable penalties those penalties should be gauged according to the conduct penalized not according to the status of the player at issue in real elected governments commission of a crime does not strip a person of elected office he or she might certainly resign in shame eg nixon or it might be cause for potential removal through a separate process eg clinton impeachment or it may cause them to lose reelection eg possibly ted stevens in the case of a separate process like impeachment or censure however that process includes a filter that prevents it from being triggered by every possible infraction and is limited to high crimes and misdemeanors an elected ruler should not face removal every time they get a speeding ticket thus having a forum ban autotrigger a csm removal vote still makes the csm office too precariousto emphasize the problem of enhancing penalties because of status consider the reverse model should csm members be immune from forum bans because of their status they need forum access to do their jobs right the justifications for this rule could just as easily be flipped to immunize csm from the rules of forum protocol that would be wrong just as csm members should not be above the law with regard to forum posting they should not be specially penalized under those rules eithergame bans are another story if you are not part of the body governed you should not be in the governing body if you are stripped of eve citizenship then your csm status should plainly follow
that has to be one of the funniest justifications ive seen in a while the thing is though im not sure its invalid
that is already in the agreement i believe
i didnt ask them not to post i asked them not to post abuse and personal attacks
the csm is not a venue for you to exercise your own personal agenda against those players who cause you of your own volition to step down from your high horse id like to ask the csm members in this thread to kindly shut up and start discussing issues that matter to the people who voted you into the council it should be possible to vote 9 people into a committee without every other proposal coming off like a slap fight between a couple babies who all want the ticklemeelmo to themselves
if they pretty up their attacks and veil them in issue tags will it be considered more appropriate
the dont come up with banana republic style plans of political take overs
i honestly dont care what they do as long as they stop using assembly hall as a venue for personal attacks and flaming discuss the pros and cons of the issue in the thread  or post other issue threads but its never appropriate to use this ah for flaming and personal attacks against eve players
i honestly dont care if you want to change the subject answer the freaking questionwhat is this supposed problem or situation you are trying to solve
perhaps they view this issue thread as a fairly transparent attack on individuals within the csm and are voicing their opinions as such id say that forum moderation is left to the moderators and none of us really has any input into that theres a lot of posts on these forums i dont like i ignore them no big deal
nor is it appropriate to introduce or support issues designed as a thinly veiled attack against another player especially when you are personally just as culpable for being banned in the past
jade is trying to pull an acorn in the csm
what hahahahahaforum bans  no point even talking about it its not up to forum moderators to ultimatelly decide who csms will be end of the storyif csm got an ingame permaban for serious violations i dont think ccp is gonna ask anyone what to do pretty sure theyd take care of it by themselvespointless thread
i have to agree with sentinel exx because that is a very reasonable argument that makes sense
well simply put i dont believe this is not personally motivatedyou can say i dont know you but in the past 5 years i have read probabbly 100s of 1000s of words written by you i feel i have a fairly good idea of your motivation within eve its has always been about you for you maybe an accusation you can sling back at me but truthfull none the lessthis topic is about getting some people you dont like removed from the csm and indeed i would feel getting the ability going forward to influence the csms makeupbait subject a with alts watch his posts like a hawk report anything that might get him a warningyou are fickle and see through you always have been most people reading this thread deserve to know the feelings of others towards you people that have experienced your poison pen once before people voting on this issue deserve to know as much as possible about the person raising it for discussion and allow formation of political discussion on the motivations behind ityou dont get to hide in csm your personality your motivations your drivers are on public display and thats exactly the way it should bethis entire suggestion is ridiculous i have received forum warnings i could be very close to another one what if i got temp banned that would in some way restrict my ability and knowledge of the game to attempt in helping influence the way the game goes forwardits a ridiculous concept and nothing more than an attempt by you to add to your toolsno doubt this post will be reportedbut this is a delagation of peers charged with making the game a better place for all of us your personality is in question as much as your suggested policies much like your questioning of others personality within this thread it is both reasonable and expected
i think weve found the heart of the issue if this cant get answered convincingly then theres really no point in discussing anything further
adding a method for removal of elected officials by people who may or may not have alternative motives is by definition itself dumb granted i only became aware of the csm recently but from my research it is an elected body of players who are tasked at bringing ingame issues to the attention of ccp the elected are elected by the player base based on who they want representing them the additional mechanism for removal shows a serious lack of foresight and thought to the point of just plain dumb i wont even discuss the potential for this post or issue to be a personal attack on someone at one time banned or not i wont discuss this not because i have a strong feeling one way or the other i wont discuss this because previous statements speak for themselves you can hide your motives only for so long before transparency takes effect once this is done you and your idea will be hung for the idiocy presented here and not for the issue you know as well as any this is a bad idea funny though it may be take a look around and count how many support and how many do not support this idea and where they come from ultimately however we ask in the spirit of level headed debate that you answer the questions provided for what reason do you want to see this idea implemented what issue will this remedy what are the ramifications of this issue oh and  why are you against the debate of an idea by attempting to silence those who appose you prior to this post the only thing i can come up with that is close to a personal attack seems to me  1 disagreement with your idea 2 not directed at you3 a figment of your imagination the quoted above was a prime example of why this idea is laughable at best furthermore without attempting to make the quoted statement a point of contention if forums rules re personal attacks etc were violated there is a proper process with which to handle this calling it out in a thread is flame bait but you already knew this have a nice day just the same durh
no this is just stupid getting someone kicked off the csm because another player thinks they are being flamed is wrongwhy dont you go stealth bomb something about it
if this goes through i pretty much plan to do this to jade whenever i get a free moment alt accounts are relatively cheap and get you 3 characters with which to troll himin addition id like to modify this so that people who are temp banned cant vote on the vote to exclude with sufficient people timing their trolling i should be able to get anyone i dont like evicted from the councilid like to throw my weight behind this issue  theres not a chance that it could be misused by the csm delegates at all
the fact that this thread is still open tells me what a good idea the op isnt
where is the vote no option or rather why hasnt anyone bothered to included one
so you would support an immediate ban of jade from the csm then
any idea how many unfair bannings there have been ccp shoots first and asks questions later i myself have been banned on an assumption alone and coincidentally ccp didnt get back to me until the ban time had already expired dumb thread
voting no on this oneforum bans are a joke since they are completely arbitrary even for ingame actions eve is well known for banning first and asking questions later ccp then take weeks to do the investigation which some other mmos do before banning someone csm membership shouldnt be voted on by the other csms in any circumstance if someone does something so horrible they should be removed from the council i have confidence ccp will act to do so
yeah maybe if the mods werent idiots and bans werent completely arbitrary
and thus the jade constantine legacy is further stamped with its signature trait of using the chair to try to push unpopular pet projects and eliminate members of the council that do not agree
has anybody yet noticed that this thread was started by serenity steele not jade constantine i mean i know they tend to be allies on the council but they are two different people
anyone who read the op did im guessing they believe the two are in cahoots as they are buddies much like if bane brought forward something i would be painted under its brush stroke
you think jade isnt pushing this issue who has the most posts in this thread
this is a ridiculous proposal going completely against the democratic principles of the csmas elected officials csm members should only lose their mandates if they are caught violating the eula or the csm agreement end of story a recall is the only other acceptable possibility even then such a provision must be made written and should not be retroactivethis kind of ad hoc justification for power grabs smacks of authoritarianism and was certainly not for this kind of fruitless discussion that we put the council in its placeshame on whoever agrees with this if youre willing to give up the power of your vote you dont deserve the right to a vote in the first place
just to be clear if a character is banned the character cant post here you are asking does your ability to interactas specified by ccp with the community you represent directly effect your ability to represent them the csm and ccpjeez
what if the character has another account and his main account gets banned as long as they have an account associated with them bravo honestly i think part of the responsibility lies of people who vote for candidates choose wisely for people who arent prone to be dramakingsthis concept runs counter to what the csm was partially formed for to be a quasiwatchdog group to questionable ccp actions if people are afraid to speak out for fear of bans and then losing their csm position were overall better off having ccp just invest the csm money to hire new staff
i disagree everyone in responsible for their own actionsi would agree or disagree with removing someone depending on the reason for the ban from what ive read this only gives the csm the option to remove a member it isnt automatic this means that both the forum moderation team and a group of the players peers must agree that the behaviour was inappropriate before anything would happen
no it means one overzealous forum moderator and a few csm members with an axe to grind can kick a legitimately elected csm member for potentially no reason at alli think we all can agree that posting something completely heinous like 2girls1cup should be banned and possibly banned from csm for being such a douche but you are forgeting that people get banned from the forums for small infractions and that will be exploited to unjustly kick someone out of the csmi could go on and on with the holes in this topic i mean you guys used irc or some chat program right wasnt lavista vista i forget who kicked from said chat shouldnt he be kicked from the csm what if my computer just doesnt like iefirefox anymore and i cant log onto the forums for 2 weeks should i get banned from csmthe number of ways csm members forum users and ccp itself can abuse the system noted in the op should not be taken lightlyalso id like to hi5 my gs brosefs
trudat honkusi was referring to using this becoming a tool for recalling csm candidates if you dont take a little time to research the post history of someone and get overcome by voters remorse well tough six months is a limited time to suffer the distractions and petty power struggles this could bring your csm may be a brat or may not always behave or advocate as you would but hey youre just getting you indirectly payvote for 
posting on the eveonline forums is completely unnecessary to the function of csm
its only not required by csm members if they choose to not interact and discussevolve issues and ideas in the jita park or assembly hall forumsi suggest that this interaction is one of the important functions that csm members should undertake the forums are where issues for the csm meeting agenda must be posted to get requisite number of votes or csm member support i find it hard to follow your reasoning that posting in the forums is not needed by a csm membertake carearithron
when the sycophants henchmen of jade unleash their diabolical plans the virtuous colorful knights of goonswarm rise up to defend the innocents good the fat and the ugly
terrible idea this is nothing more than a backhanded attempt to make the csm team fit the ideology of a couple of representatives who are looking to water down the aspects of the game that they arent personally involved in
incorrect there are a lot of forums on the internet whereby you can interact with people who play eve many people detest these forums and the moderation of them and will avoid them these people are voting eve players one could make the argument that by focusing so much on these forums youre actually neglecting a large portion of the playerbase anyone can post a thread on the assembly hall it does not need to be a csm representative i can say quite definitely from a position of experience that few others if any have that it has not been required for me in the least to be able to post on the eveonlinecom forums everedit actually it is required that you not be banned to submit your passport for candidacy that may or may not be intentional if youre someone like me you can simply ignore the forums until it comes time to submit your passport as eventually someones report clicking will stick
actually issues and ideas posted on other forums afaik arent binding on the csm and cant be put onto an agenda unless first posted in the assembly hall for 7 days and then getting a csm support posted or 5 of voters approvalhowever if you feel that interaction with posters on issues and ideas in the assembly hall or jita park is not needed as a player representative on the csm fair enoughwe just have obviously diametricallyopposed viewpoints on what csm members should be doingtake carearithron
representing eve players i already addressed the assembly hall in that very same postrepresenting eve players and posting on the eveonlinecom forums are mutually exclusive nevermind the slew of other issues thats already been mentioned repeatedly by myself and others in this very thread
i agree that other forums are valuable for csm members to garner player opinions and the like however i must have read your post above before editingi took it to mean that you didnt think it was needed for a csm member to interact and post on issues in the assembly hall at all despite this being the place that issues must be posted to gather supportif this isnt what you meant accept my apologiesi can see clearly that you are now posting on the forums on eveotake carearithron
haha touche the thing being that im posting here out of choice not out of necessity i go very long periods of time without even reading these forums
you should post here more often many of your ideas are interesting and show effort and prior thought in the very least they get discussion going and other players views and inputi look forward to working with you on the csm hopefully not from the position of alternate againtake carearithron
what would you suggest as an alternative i am very much in favour of a csm member being removed if they step outside the rules in a derogatory or detrimental fashion to individuals andor the community and to echo gramtars sentiment i believe ccp wouldnt allow someone to be evicted from the council unjustly
i really would like to see this implementedmost of the players i guess 90 are unable to log in during day timelike myself i always have to do some real planning in my training queues to calculate a full 24 hours of training and i have to do the short skills during the weekendsthis would release me and a lot of other players from the intensive planningi also can agree with this kind of feature although not as efficient as the first oneif i could chose rather not the dual training as said before it slows down the training of all other skillsunless ccp makes it possible to do trainings with more than 1 character on the same account at a timei totally agree wrath ccp should make work of this
im here supporting third part skill training macros with trojans
queued skill training would be great but dual is not neccessary
queued training is my choice
im not a big fan of the dual training idea but a single queued skill would be a great addition people would still need to log in after each skill completion to at least add another skill to the queue except now they can do it at a more convenient time rather than when the skill endsi do think though that if a skill queue is implemented the next skill should only commence training if the account is active

supporting this one as welli believe theres often more value in providing ccp with feedback on how better to interact with their customers than there is in trying to play intern developer

i hate to say it darius but you have come up with some good ideas
oh i should probably support my own topic
supported
works for me
the audacity of suggesting important account information be readily available supported
i dont see why they do not already have this
it doesnt get bonuses from most ships  none of the ships that can fit it motherships have bonuses to ecmit costs tons of cap  its a capital module it should have capital cap costsit has a 30s cycle  20 second duration 5 minute base reactivation delayit doesnt actually jam anything  how do you figure jam strength of 25 should have good odds against most shipsit doesnt work on the one thing itd be superusefull against drones since they just instarelock  they would  after the 20 second jam cycle finishesit affects your own fleet members up to 27km away give or take  yes its an aoe weapon and theres no magic making firendly ships immunegiven the high jam strength compare it to an ecm burst ii at 72 and a wellskilled falcon at around 14 per jammer i think the jam strength is pretty sizeable  its jam strength is higher than the sensor strength of a basic battleship that means that used properly your fleet has a roughly 30 second turkey shoot at the beginning of a battle with most of the opposing fleet unable to return fire it cant permajam like a falcon can but it can affect an entire blob unlike a falcon ive not been in a position to use it but it strikes me as a very useful fleet tool and most of the issues you raise dont seem like issues
no ecm burst like the remote one is supposed to break locks which it does ive done it to miners on multiple occasions it really does work and it its supposed to cap you out if you are using it on an underside ship a scorpains bonus does apply to it if you bothered to check it also doesnt use that much cap when you look at a battleships which is what its really ment for even those the tool tip doesnt say thats what its ment foragain this is a non issue because the op is misinformed
still wronghowever ill take this moment to point out this module is so crap people dont even know it existsthe module i am talking about is this onethe capital module you are talking about it this onethese are not the same module seriously go buy an ecm burst i and put it on a frig it fits it can be usedbut it just sucksedit also as one person apparently doesnt know  the ecm burst module does not jam it only breaks target locks there is no 20s jam the affected just lose their locks and can immediately relock also ship bonuses either dont apply some are bugged or they only apply partially as the ecm burst has the exact same range on my caracal as it does on my blackbirdit sucks so hard you people have never even heard of it
again you didnt read what i said i said the scorpian bonus does apply to this module but the falconrookblackbirdskitsunegriffon dont i dont know why you are so denseecm bust does break locks it does work
actually all you said was that the scorpions bonus applies you said nothing about others not so one assumed that you meant that ship bonuses in general work  which they dontso in any case the ship bonuses are bugged save for the scorpionand sigh yes i know it breaks locks congratulations on your obviousness cpt obvious the point is it still blows it takes a ton of cap has a superlong cycle and doesnt jamyou know basically exactly what i said in the op
i have seen it work many times as i was the intended target on several occasions did something happen to it in the last week or so that it doesnt work any more or is it because it doesnt work every time when you want it to
are you just trolling nowi already said it works i know it works im just saying it is a subpar module and in need of some love
no i am not trolling i am just responding to your rant in the op it seems to work fine it like other ecm is chance based the t2 version has a 72 to all races the multi craptastic spectral ecm hits around 8 with good bonuses ecm racials and multis are limited to targets locked and one module per target the ecm burst hits everythingno troll just wondering whats up

lets get a few things out of the way first before we start discussing the real issues that plague eve ccp intend to release ambulation ambulation is a fantastic idea were it not for the fact that they spend more time and money on promoting something that wont be released for quite some time rather than fixing the real problems of eve also ambulation is an experiment intended to test the mechanics of their wod mmo what powers does the csm have other than the power to be ignored so far we have seen very little concrete evidence that ccp actually will do anything the csm propose other than pretend they care the csm have been forbidded from discussing certain issues because ccp want to move on to more important things and dont want to dwell on issues they dont care about the issues i am talking about are lag and disconnectsthe csm is obviously not a revolutionary idea the idea was implemented by sony in an attempt to save them from disaster and look where that led them soe has become a company many people avoid simply because of the great work they have done over the years they are experts at taking successfull mmos and totally ruining them through lack of support and lack of care as long as the customer pays sony are happyi am beginning to see that ccp and sony share one very fundamental aspect and thats neither care about their customers how many people have proposed things that would help the game how many people have asked ccp to solve really important issues rather than concentrate on attracting more players through unwanted expansions ccp usually have a very good response to these either they are very straightforward and say no or have some half baked excuse that the mechanic that has been proposed would break the game prevent people from logging in ruin experience etc of course these are ridiculous excuses and we all know thisthe question is what future does the csm have i know many people who never voted and will not vote because the csm has no power and ccp arent listening there are many people who cant play and ccp dont care about paying customers who need the help so who are the csm for ccp to take time effort and energy to lend an ear tomy point is not whining about ccps utter contempt for us as players but to ask what future eve the csm and our relationship with ccp have do we need ccp to go down the path of soe and lose millions possibly billions before they learn players will punish them or are there ways we the players can make ccp listen if not then what options do we have if none then we can simply disband the csm as some failed experiment and accept that we are running around in a mill while ccp watch and take notesi obviously trust ccp to show the same amount of care they have in the past and continue on their path of selfdestruct the same path sony took but i would like to hear from the rest of the csm and all players in regards to this matter
nope this thread will still be locked for trolling thoughcsms were a sop to the community and in particular to impress the mainstream media after the various developer scandals it was never intended to have actual power all they can do is suggest changes and ccp are free to act on them one way or another on their own discretion
it doesnt really need to be locked for trolling  it does however need to be moved to jita park because its not an issue thread and shouldnt be in ah
personally i think the poster should be bannedbut thats meme thumbs down
did the notion of it becoming in style to bash the csm suddenly infuse those with 5 of the courage to outright get it done that the forum wind was finally blowing into their whinesails and that the rest of eve would recognize their trendinessa lot of halfhearted onlystatingthefacts have been coming out of the woods lately maybe its time for a csm bashers have completely failed kind of fad
your statement is incorrect ccp are already working on reducing lag they are in fact and have been dwelling on lag for a very long time ccp has stated that they believe that lag is an important issue for themthis thread is pointless and telling ccp to do something they are already doing is also a waste of time
this whole line of argument is old tired and pretty clearly false yes ccp is a business and yes their marketing department has some influence over what happens but what precisely is the alternative you want to see  would you prefer that the game is silkysmooth and lagfree with no players and a bankrupt company running it because from here that looks like the alternative ill criticize some of their past decisions in a lot of fields but im not such a fool as to believe that they can just overturn all of those decisions instantly and with no ill consequences just because you dont want to make tough decisions does not prevent ccp from being required to make them look at the issue of reloading all ammo at once for example  i started the thread that the csm brought forward so i think we can all agree that im for it i regard their argument that itll increase lag as a bit unlikely but i dont fault ccp for making it its really easy to snipe from the sidelines and to complain about not living in the best of all possible worlds i think theyre being too cautious and are making a bad decision because of it but i wont be the one getting the fix teh lagz whines if it turns out that theyre not just because you arent getting what you want when you want it does not mean that their rationale for not giving it to you is bad your whines dont have limitations but their programmers do the fact that ccp is working within those limitations does not mean that the csm has failed  quite the contrary those limitations are the reason that the csm could possibly be successful if ccp could make a game spring fullyformed from hammers forehead then they wouldnt need us to tell them what to do theyd just do it but because they have development cycles limited manpower and all the rest of that stuff they cant do everything and so they need to set priorities this is the primary function of the csm in many ways  it sorts out the signal from the noise and says players genuinely care about x but y and z are just being flogged by a handful of loudmouths ignore them to ccp a year from nowie a development cycle well see the results of that id like it faster but i know thats either impossible or likely to give us another bootini issue from lack of testing patience  all good things will come to those who wait
that is exactly what im trying to hammer into these peoples infernal thick skullsstop whining and shut the frick up if you want to help then be constructive or gtfo and gb2wowthe csm are human beings just like the rest of us they make mistakes just like the rest of us but at least they give a damn about us and thats why the bother to put up with our whines and complaints and gnashing of teethheck id been tempted to dig in except for my lack of age and time put into eve but i couldnt tolerate half the stupidity i see that gets flung all over the placepeople who sign up for the csm should be given a solid pat on the back for tolerating the trash that gets thrown around agenda or not at least they are tryinggive im credit for thatps herschel you runnin id vote for yah  o 
the csm is makin a difference thing is given development schedules we wont see the fruits of this until next year i am heartened by the responses from ccp about the value of the csm and ultimately players submitting on assmbly hall input ccp are a company providing an enjoyable game for us to play its in their best interests financially to implement ideas that will enrich gameplay and make players stick about for more than 3 months paying subscriptions since players might have ideas about what some good features are it makes sense to give them a conduit the csm to express these to ccpthe csm acts as a clearing house for these ideas those with merit are put forward for the consideration of ccp it was clear from the last meeting that ccp was taking these ideas and using them to shape future expansions and development pathsone of the additional functions that the csm serves is to make sure that ideas and issues that reach an agenda are well constructeddefined and meet the criteria to be considered player supportcsm member support an essential function in this is csm members interacting with players in the assembly hall and jita park and additionally via other forums and channels take carearithron
ccps ignorance is sometimes unbelievable amarr swap ammo immediately and have the best snipe ships in eve how many amarr only fleets participate in fights ccp should stop pretending the csm mean anything and admit the csm are just a veil hung before our eyes in the hope we wont get even more angry with them for being blind and not playing the gameuntil ccp start listening to what we want rather than what they think we should want the csm and all proposals are a joke ccp should rename to sony v ii and simply admit the nonsense that goes on in the game
consider allowing firelinking of turrets or launchers of the same typehave your seven tachyon laser turret act like a single turret that does x7 damage and when you load it it takes x7 of the ammo i dunno it might be a way to reduce db calls
i want to be able to type 4582045756674 letter walls of text in the help channel too for the lulz imagine that wouldnt it be great if you could type so many letters you could block out everyone elses chati will vote for this but i would change the topic to i want to be able to spam at hearts content so can i have a permanent mute placed on me that should make op happy right
anyone who wants to do that already can  shiftenter is a lolspammers best friend the worst part about that being that you cant mute them because the text scrolls too fast for you to be able to get a clean rightclick onto their namewhich is mostly the fault of an error in how text channels work in eve but thats a different topic anything can be abused by morons  such is the nature of morons you might as well at least let the legitimate users use it too so that csm meetingsfor example dont have all this confusion of text limit vs done talking
also increase the limit on character names and most especially ship names this includes starbases and anchorable cans you cant have the a fuer und wasser iii without you know the und wasser iii
may i ask why we need more isk sinks in particular
1 totaly nonsense 100 or 1000 isk wouldnt change a thing you would need to set it a lot higher to have an effect on lag situation this beeing said 10000 isk per jump would limit the sandbox design of eve way to much dont ya think 2 sure it does miners mission runners ratters and industrialists would be much less affected then tradershaulers pvpers 3 there you go but why again do we need those isk sinks people getting to rich in eve and we need more grinding  yeah thats it  no wait more people grinding would mean less people pvping right less combats would mean less destructed stuff right i suck at maths but wouldnt that lead to inflation and people whining for more isk sinks again
maybe start by quadrupling empire sales taxes  because all empires are all at war righttry to think of ideas that dont involve creating more transactions that need to be tracked work with the existing systems first if possible makes it easier to implement and maintain
with all the hubbub about the nanonerf and some of its motivation supposedly being it allows risk free combat i think that the issue of combat outside stations should be addressedthe ability to enter combat outside stations then to redock in ships with reasonable tanks is currently abused by many players here is a typical scenarioa player undocks from a station in a ship with a good tank eg multiple plates and trimarks on a bs or a carrierthe player enters combat and is completely safe from almost any form of retaliationthis is practically risk free for players abusing this game mechanic if any attempt is made to bait the player as soon as he sees local spike or more hostile ships on scan  grid he just deaggresses will mostly have plenty of time to wait out his short aggression redock timer and dockthe only chance is if he can be bumped away from the station which is near impossible for many stations with huge docking radii also if the speed nerf goes ahead bumping will be near impossible even for stations with a small docking radiusthis should be a really simple thing to fix imo many ways todo it a simple solution that comes to mind is just to increase the redock timer for stations after aggression this will not stop players from undocking and redocking in say haulers as long as they do not aggress anything but as soon as they shoot anything they should not be able to redock for a much longer period of time say 5 minutes maybe morethoughts
i support this d
several threads about increasing the docking timer already throwing support in anyway though
this one as submitted to ccp in iceland  theyre working on it
everyone station hugs the difference here is when you agress tank and dock i think anyone who gets involved with a fight shooting or repping you should lose docking rights for 5 mins simple period the only time you can dock is if your ship blows and youre ejected to a pod otherwise wait out the 5 mins of your agressing actionsof course this does not apply to npcs and missions
absolutely ive posted much more strict penalties than this but bottom line is that the current redock timer for ships that have flagged themselves is a joke when pilots choose to engage they should be required to live with the consequencesthis should be called the empire griefer corp nerf and it has my support
this would work however presumably it would also apply to the members of your corp currently in the npc corps
given that some players are much richer than others how do you plan to calculate this fee

i have no knowledge of who or what is doing this youll have to take that up with our ceothis is the assembly hall a place to discuss ideas personal attacks are meant for places elsewhere unless you want to find your account banned or blocked i suggest you keep that in mindwhat i say here and elsewhere doesnt necessarily reflect the views of the ceo of the shadow cadre well duhas far as tactics involved the only ones who have left are people who joined to be industrialists and then didnt appreciate getting dragged into a war dec for the foolish notion of a mining permit while i do not personally agree with there decision as it is rather not so goodi cant exactly stop them now can ii cant control any one individuals actions only my ownif you cant think that far you have no business posting hereeither you post something constructive or you gtfowhich is why im even here in the first place and i find it disturbing that your obviously ignoring the intention of my post to prevent such things from happening and the abuse of the systemfor you to overlook such an obvious thing for selfish intentions is nothing short of disgusting and insulting
thats why im asking for people to come up with ideas as to how that goes aboutperhaps a direct percentage of your total wealth coupled with a direct ratiocolleration with the size of your corpthe idea is to penalize them not bankrupt themim not too good with algorithmic math  o p
i dont think ccp would be so forgivingthis is the csm assembly hall not diplomatic or alliance discussionstake your business elsewherealso remember im not ceo just a simple member of a simple corptalk to him not me
not the first answer or acknowledgment of the problem in here so far what gives could we at least have an explanation as to why a t1 fitted rokh or an apoc out ranges and out tracks a t2 fitted tempest while also being able to fit an omni dd tankim fine with being a glass cannon but the cannon part doesnt exactly exist anymore
hows this for an ideawhen you log out your ship never disappears from space instead it becomes unscanable after 1 minute without agression 15 with agression
yay clogged up gatesjust imagine jita
they still attempt to warp off just dont disappear after 115 minutes
was thinking about that just before and thought of something that could be an improvement instead of the current ship disappears after 30 sec if there is no aggression before he logschange to a 30sec timer from the time he logs where the server checks to see if there has been any aggression up to the end of the timerwould make a considerable portion of logoffskis fail as opposed to the way it is now and also still not screw over legitimate dcs youd still emergency warp if not pointed and still disappear if nothing finds you in 30sec or however long the current timer is

wasnt the csm created not to tell ccp what to put into the game or what to change but to approve what they were going to changeif so why is there so much complaining on csm about fundamentals that make eve well eve just checking as i read alot of complaints about wahh im tired of getting ganked learning skills are 2 hardor am i more ed than normal
csm was created to filter the issues that the player base wanted to raise with ccp and present the arguments for the good ones to ccp clearly and concisely to allow the devs to make up their mind about what they diddid not put indecisionmaking has always sat with ccp
did the csm have any part in making the rorqual low sec only 
no the rorqual was implemented before the csm came into existence
there was no reason to not buff the celestis family of ships after nerfing rsds supportin dis

nano requires player skill and is fun against
ccp need to get a grip tbh
dont kill roaming in eve jumping 100 jumps in slow ass ships is booring as hell
there is a problem with the very high end nano setups rather than addressing these type of setups the fix is to effectively remove this type of setup completelyin their currently proposed form i am against the changes
there is no reason to eliminate a perfectly good form of gameplay with such a heavy handed nerf even with the new changes
against balancing ludicrous speed is fine but a general speed nerf is a bad idea
minor nerf maybe but not the nerf currently suggested

the primary purpose for the titan doomsday was to decrease lag through removing a part of the player field that is in systemone of the problems seems to be that lag after a titan doomsday is not really decreased due to the amount of wrecks that a successfull doomsday createsso why not after the initial powerful titan doomsday which creates all the wrecks let the titan immediately create a second tiny doomsday just enough to destroy all the wreckspods on the field which should give a real reduction of the laga side effect of the second doomsday would also be that removing the wrecks and their contents would be a deterrent for misusing the titans doomsday to doomsday small gangs of 210 peeps due to not being able to loot afterwards
this will have the extremely opposite effect  it will create more lag
the game needs less doomsdays not more
because you can use the macro keys to not go into afk status find out yourself how which is exploited in battlegrounds to soak up honor points buy pvp gear without effort normally when you go into afk status after 5 minutes you are removed from the battleground so your team does not suffer having a player lessi would however like to see g15 support for eve i love the lcd display
any word on how this is going on or has it been binned lol
if my ship jumps to a few kms to avoid a cepter or vaga splatting up the side of my battle cruiser when my top speed is only 180ms makes the whole excuse of collision detection and avoidence well franky sillyfix it please ccp station and gate games are only made more lame by this broken mechanic
bumping is silly but needed under the current game mechanics
absolutely
supporting dis i would set one up somewhere obnoxious like pr
hey dariusnice idea i had an idea a while ago that might dovetail nicely with this one its on my webpageits not completely the same as its still probeable but it also has some limited defenses tell me what you think plz
i love the idea but i think a blackops bs should be required to maintain it with something like a warfare link module have the blackops bs capacitor maintain the shield when you activate the module from outside the cloak it will take half your capacitor and regenerate the shield for x hours this gives you a chance to both probe the base by probing the blackops bs fueling it but also stops the attacker from having to bring fuel in fueling stuff sucks only allow a blackops bs carry one of these by having it be a launchable item from the module that only a blackops bs can fit that would put more of those ships at risk and have a larger riskreward to deploying one of these
so you want a free cloak on all your ships without any drawback of fitting oneif so than very big noif you want a ship maintenance array and a gsc that cannot be probed by themselves but do not provide any protection for ships and can be anchored anywhere in systemthen maybethe most protection i would be willing to support would be something like a dead space like protection decreasing chance of being probed out like in a mission spot
what if it only cloaked unoccupied ships sort of as an impromptu hangar for that matter you could even give it actual hangar space although not a lot
i see your point these things would then need to be expensive enough so that wouldnt be a viable option what im really concerned about is lowsec being riddled with these things where every pirate corp has a bunch in each systemedit page3
perhaps to prevent people from putting up too many of these things there could be a limit to how many one character can anchor which would be determined by some silly highrank skill so a maximum of five per characteredit and the skillbook should be expensive

sounds awesome id enjoy both using these and scanning them out
the idea of a supply depot behind enemy lines is a nice one but being cloaked while youre using it is just too prone to abuse i think if you remove the whole cloaking thing it works well make the structure itself unscannableprobable but no cloaking while using it which means you dont hang out there unless you want to be probed out and destroyed itd keep usage to quieter times and less of something youd be able to use during actual battleswithout the cloaking stuff id support it in a heartbeat but so long as it can be used as a place to hide cant say i like it
i like both the original idea and this addition no fueling needed but an extra role for black ops nice
like the general idea since its freshits pretty much to hide it since you always see whos in local and whenever someone has their ship outside the cloaking range you can scan it in 20 sec to find the grid and then its just a matter of waiting in a cloaker to spot where ships gowhat about having a pirate structure in a gas cloud or asteroid belt which makes it undectable by probing but also receiving damage from the cloud or belt then you have to rep the structure back up and and ships in there also have to be repped or they simply explode in time a couple of days
like i was hinting at with the distance requirements you could have one for being unable to park one within a certain radius of other cloaked poss something like within 10 aus or something maybe 5
i would enjoy this even more if those inside the cloak of the pirate base didnt show up in local
sounds interesting
yeh i know what you mean this cloaking thing is a bit far fetched if you made it unprobableunscannable then people would be less likely to abuse it in fact you should make them bright pink and call it a bungadoo theres a new thread for you

this could work if you also had a pos module that allowed the defenders to scan for these types of posmake the scan take a significant amount of time23 days and give the cloaked pos owner a timer so that he knows when the scan is going to endthis way you can clear old pos structures and the aggressors have to keep moving their operation aroundotherwise i dont see it being a reasonable idea
the only suggestion i would add to this is alternative method for finding these structures in spacehave these structures show up as unknown anomalies through exploration exactly the same as a combat site hit but give them a very low signature where a very determined prober may need to spend several hours 6 to scan a well placed structure downthis way you introduce a risk that a general explorer might get very lucky or unlucky while looking for exploration sitesit gives a determined hostile the tools to track down over time a structureand it means that the person deploying the structure has to be very careful of where they deploy your covert base to ensure its more than 5au away from any celestial so to be outside onboard ship scanner range
both the arguements re fueling and disintegration dont have to be mutually exclusive perhaps the way to work it would be you can get it anchored but it wont online without a new fuel make it small and yes expensive did like the idea industrialist make it from reactions lets get everyone involved perhaps an 8 moon mineral reaction and then you fill the structure before onlining this will be your first and only time to fill it if you fill it to max it will last for the maximum duration otherwise itll pop out of existence when the fuel goes out
this sounds like a good idea its worth a discussion
i can agree with this

sorry to say but this gets a big no in my book when you fly the big pretty shiny ships you take the big risks i fly a carrier and fly it under the presumtion that there is a good chance i might loose it every time i undock it or move it from the pos shileds just because i have a tank and fighters doesnt make me any less vulnerable to a small gang then a freighter all it takes it a tackler to hold me down and someone to neut my capactior and im as good as gone so sorry no high sec jump ins for jump freighters you have to share the risk like the rest of us
i could not disagree with this proposal more strongly its not supposed to be easy theres supposed to be risk people who want to play a game on god mode never cease to amaze me
your argument is moot when you want to introduce pirate faction towers which are unprobable
pirate towers with inherent risk built into them to be used in 00 where there is no artificial safety net theres also within the idea the concept of periods of probablility your argument is moot when you compare apples to oranges
i would support this if empires then treated all cynos in their hisec space as an illegal act and concord came along and killed any ship generating a cyno and the ship jumping to it100 risk for 100 safety seems fair to me
why complicate things just make a bs sized hauler classjust like a normal hauler price around 50150m isk etc a simple stepping stone towards the freightersif you want to do fancy jumping cloaking omghax ships make a t2 variant
as an alternative to what posting on the eve forums posting on another forum any other forum email evemail when fixed talking in game there are a slew of alternatives to using the eveonlinecom forums when it comes to communicating with people who play eve re ccp allowing it that would need to be addressed internally by ccp this isnt a thread recommending that ccp be able to intervene and save a csm member its not a thread saying that ccp should be able to remove csm members its a thread requesting that via some magical againstccppolicies mechanism the csm discover when a member has been temp banned so that they can then decide to vote them out of the council based on circumstances for which the representative will have not real ability to defend themselves its a thread requesting that the ccp moderation team which has deemed itself beyond the purview of the csm in any way be in the position of deciding not just who can post on their awfully moderated forums but also who can serve as a representative thats just plain silly
a some what theatrical representation some of which i would actually agree with unfortunately its the parts you seem to be deliberately ignoring that would swing my support for the the issue within reason i wouldnt be in favour of removal of a player representative based on constructive interaction with ccp i would be in favour of the option of removing a representative who cant interact with other members of the community on eo within the guidelines given by ccpthis suggestion so far is the best to this ends so ill ask again do you have a better alternative
the players elect the csm representatives and the players should be the only ones with the power to remove a csm representative ccp should have no power to remove csm reps because that would completely compromise the entitys independence and ability to provide input without fear of ccp shutting off lines of communication by banning a csm rep
what is he ignoringwhy is a forum banned representative a problemthese questions have still not been answered
how bout the alternative is not changing something that works asis
im not sure i understand why a temp ban on the eveo fora which are wholly separate from the game itself should warrant removal from the csm your idea is beyond idiotic
a better alternative is nothing if it aint broke dont fix it
has my support you carry a responsability i dont see how people find getting banned easy if you keep a civil tone at all times
civil is completely subjective id also like to remind you people that these are forums for a spaceship game where you kill people dumbing down the conversation to the level of the sickening repeated pretend niceties should not be a desired end result for any competent moderation team
the responsibility of csm is not to be a shiny perfect person that falls on the shoulders of the moderators and devs csm are normal people that are elected by other normal people to try and help fix the gamethe csm is not meant to be a pedestal but unsurprisingly certain egotistical people have turned it into just that  a position of power where no power was meant to exist nor should ita temporary ban means that the offense was not heinous enough to remove them from the population of eve it is a slap on the wrist and is usually a completely subjective judgment callthe only case where this should even be considered is on permanent bans of the account this clearly makes sense because they have had their ability to contribute to the game removed full stopit does not matter if a person gets along with the others or the rest of the eveo community what matters is that they were elected by said community if you dont like him the solution is as simply as common democracy dont vote for him next round saves lots of unnecessary drama
1 naivenobody is perfect but it doesnt hurt to try
i dont find it theatrical at all let me break down the facts for page 71 ccp policy will not allow them to discuss bans with anyone but the person who has been banned this means the council will never know that one of their members has been banned because guess what theres no reason for them to inform the council nor is there any activity of the council that is required which would make this apparent nor should there be2 the forum moderation policies were placed by ccp beyond the purview of the csm this means that the above policy cannot be altered or even questioned so that the recommendation in this thread can even remotely become a reality3 as per the example i posted in detail of my own situation it can be seen that people can be banned for items that are quite trivial 4 ccp has given no guidelines for how representatives should interact this is mostly because their own mechanisms are either broken or were not up to snuff it was only a week ago that the csm even got a section on the forums5 allowing council members the leverage to remove each other will only create more silly situations like this thread situations where people who have a bone to pick with other council members will seek to consistently passiveagressively find ways to manipulate their removal rather than working on what they were elected to do perhaps we should have csm survivor and we should vote someone off every week last man standing wins eve in this scenario had cooler heads not prevailed at least one council member would not have made it through the term this first session while i think the result would have been a net positive it would have disenfranchised their supportersnow you claim the suggestion is the best there is the best there is to solve what problem i dont have an alternative because i prefer to find solutions to problems rather than create solutions and try to manufacture problems to fit it game account bans already warrant removal from the council by ccp this problem has already been solvedthis is not the csms responsibility in any way the council does not and will not have the resources or ability to actually follow through on it and it is not a need im not sure how much more succinctly it could be put
i am well aware of the potential draw backs of this this is why i have constantly ask you to provide a better alternative but clarifying that on the ccp provided media forumsgame community representatives are required to interact with the community they represent in a manner consistent with the ccp specified rules is much too important a subject to simply ignore btw this isnt a fact guidelines are provided here for interacting with other members of the community applies only on eo ofc
everyone is well aware of the potential drawbacks that is why we keep asking what is the problem in the first place that needs to be resolvedwhat is the problem that needs to be fixedyoure misunderstanding the original statement
a better alternative for what theres no problemthat link is the forum rules the forum and the csm are mutually exclusive by the design of the ccp forum team the only standing rule for a csm representatives behavior is that they not violate the eula which would result in a ban which would result in removal a rule that already exists and a valid one as it would be pretty hard to represent a game you cant play because you cheated or said something terrible like a racist commentthe guidelines i was referring to are regarding as i said how representatives should interact ccp has not provided the tools for this that is a fact the council had to create its own mailing list its own website to publish the minutes ccp did notthe only thing that link provides is rules for posting on the eveonlinecom forums that has nothing to do with the council whatsoever
quis custodiet ipsos custodeswe voted the csm candidates into office lets not give the forum moderation team the ability to remove them its a one year position
6 months
the good thing about jade is that its motives are so poorly hidden that you really have to be dumb to not see through them
this was originally posted by ccp greyscale in features and ideas discussion and i would like to get support for this so that its is not lost in the pile of paper work that eve development can becomethe original thread is here
the main purpose of the csm is to bring ideas forward to ccp not to repeat ideas that ccp already has it has 8 pages mostly of support and id bet that itll be included in the next appropriate expansion i like the proposal but it isnt something that the csm needs to concern itself with unless someone has something to add
single skill queue is pretty much perfect anything beyond that is just benefiting the lazy
skill queues have already been discussed with ccp at the first meeting in iceland someone getting their computer hacked because they were cheating does not constitute an emergency issue imo ccp has received feedback
the skillqueue system should have been implemented yesterday  enough said
there should definatly be some sort of mechanic put into place for lining up skills to train 1 after the other now if people are worried about people cancelling the accounts and just letting them train then what could be done is to just make it so that when you deactivate your account you simply stop training skills period thats how it works in every other game if your not paying to play you cant gain experience this is how it should be for eve as well regardless of if there are skill ques or not
with the colapse of the iceland banks and with uk goverments sueing the banks for 1bill will eve continue to play even tho the game and team are based there and have no access to funds 
oh my gosh oh my gosh the sky is falling the sky is falling the sky is fallingrun for coverno offense man but thats what your screaming in your postand its a waste of timeall your doing is making it worse by causing panic or inducing fear with the general trendlife will go on and im quite sure eve online will be there waiting for you
its 20bil fyi and gordys demanding it in british money v0v im sure well all be playing spaceships just fine in the future id recommend putting your money in a bank that actually guarantees your deposits instead of taking a gamble on a foreign bank that doesnt and shaking your fist about it after the fact
well i hope we do continue playing  fly safe 
eve has one advantage some other locations do not have its multinational it could easily repackage everything and head to its facilities in the usa london or taiwan iircccp will continue with multinational income i dont think theres anything to worry about if there is im sure thats their first concern
supported  missions are broken
voting yes for losing probes due to dclagcrash
i think this a good idea but it would break eve is every player could create unique itemspersonally i would like to see some additional tools on the manfacturing side one tool that i have been wishing for is a manfacturing container where you drag and drop your bpos that would rollup the mineral and build times and could be built using one factory slot instead of having to run 7 really fast jobs in tandumthe tool would be a something like a fitting window for ships and would pop out the frigs with the mods already fitted to the shipnow that would be very nice
delete sorry
got my full support
locked at request of op
your main argument seems to be the ability to compress highsec ore just wondering why one would need the orca for that purpose wouldnt it be much easier to implement the possibility to use compression blueprints inside stations like another poster already suggestedthat way one could mine veldspar in highsec transport is to a station with a factory slot compress it and then transport it to 00 to be decompressedjust wondering why the orca comes in to play hereall for an orca btw  but failing to see why it would be the best solution for this specific problem
supported for sure a empire baby rorqual for those people who want to fly a rorqual but dont have the skills yet
hurr forgot to support
i absolutely agree with this idea
having a little reminder is always helpful to not slip up again
so and i was never even talking about how long it jams or it even does i was just comparing the chance it has to work along with the other ecms it is working as intended just not the way you want it to its a trade off instead of jamming one target for a period of time you affect a number of targets by breaking their locks so whats the problem
1 it works as intended  it breaks target lock2 if all the ecm boats bonuses worked with it it would be overpowered3 if it cost less cap it would also make it overpowering as well as lowering the cycle time on it if they made the changes to it your asking for it would make it the new ew of choice for solo ganking imagine a cheap cap wise ecm going off requiring no lock before effecting the target ship
i didnt request all those changes i requested one change and listed a few possibilitiesif its expensive and slow  unbonused  at least have it jamif its slow  unbonused  doesnt jam  make it cheapif its expensive  slow  doesnt jam  gimme my bonusesin short  its too prenerfed
what are you guys ing about instead of saying oh i want lag free battles whine whine whine try posting ideas to fix it or shut up fact is they are doing a great job 10 sec mod delay would be a god send in fleet battles past that you guys miss all that info on stackless io and possible hpc systems as well as 64 bit clients and servers running 30 ghz dual cores with 16 gigs of ram i dont see the issue jita with 1400 players in it still responsive 1100 man fleet battles with 20 to 40 sec mod lag i dont see the issue and the promise of it getting better with there plans right up where everyone can see them in the dev blogsyou guys forget yourself 2 years ago you couldnt cram 400 people into a system without it crashing your talking about 1000s of calculations a min each gun each missile each drone each ship the type of dmg resists ammo type rof and 1000s of more calcs that have to be done by the server the server is running better then ever if you want to keep smacking ccp then make your own mmo that supports the kind of play style and 40000 plus players online on a single server and show them how its done is eve perfect is stackless python the best code they could have used no but that doesnt mean bash them and act like they have done you some wrong they are doing the best they can and tbh its damn good so stop sticking your nose up at them and offer things that could help not just the same old  thread of fix lagggg omg the laggggg or quit ing they have shown us all how they have reduced lag and they dont need the poeple in this thread to  at them all the time as its already been said you make the server so it can support 1000 man fleet battles then people will try to stuff 1400 people into a system you dont want lag make sure to keep your fleet battles to 300 a side or less and you should be just fineless ing more constructive posts
oh and another thing regarding fw please please please change the logic that spawns complexes at dt in fact change it for normal exploration too make them respawn immediately or an hour after capture or twentyfour hours later or really anything other than at only one specific time per day
then they are shortsighted and foolish the more people who vote the more power the csm has because it is clearly representing a larger portion of the player base if 90 of the player base voted and brought in candidates who advocated no pve content that eve should be 100 pvp  then ccp would seriously need to sit down and make some decisions about the direction of the game or risk alienating a massive percentage of the player base who might then choose to take their entertainment eurodollar elsewhereof course the issues are never quite that cut and dried but the fact remains that in eve as well as in rl the more people who vote the more representative is the result if you dont vote then you dont really have a leg to stand on if you say that the elected individuals dont have power or dont represent you

the poll threads are hardly trolling theyre a patch on a forum mechanic that has only been implemented partially and theyre a very useful one at that it was and isalbeit on the back burner the biggest issue to most players and having a concrete method of telling what people thought about it was a massively valuable thing and your last example is just juvenile i think drake is being a bit of jerk asking for your ban but if those are the worst other threads you can find maybe hes right what they have achieved at this point is minor  as i said a typical development cycle is a year long and their first submission to ccp was three months ago as for what they will and could achieve thats obviously much greater i expect the csm to have a major role in shaping ccps vision of what players want and how we want it as well as providing a useful vector for cool new ideas on how things could work ccp has taken player suggestions and put them into the game before  i believe that they directly attributed the stab nerf to a player for example  but this provides a mechanism for them to do so in a better fashion who said anything about shutting up i said to have a bit of faith and a bit of patience im certainly not opposed to complainingjust look at my forum history just to complaining done ignorantly

i would point out that theyre also not chance based like ecm are however i agree that rsds should be examined and perhaps given a slight boost to make them a more viable option especially for role bonus shipsmind you i think a good deal of the electronic warfare repertoire rsds tps tds and the directly related drones need a tweak towards greater affect on combat supported

the timers exist to provide defenders with a means to defend themselves against attacks that are off their normal timezone that being said i largely agree that planetary colonies maybe even lunar colonies given the moon meets certain criteria like no mooon minerals  around a gas gaint hehe should be where the actually occupation and sovreignity lies but this will mean that planets should have a mechanism beyond capital ships blowing up the station etc one method but shouldnt be the rewarding oneno i think a protracted siege of the systemsurrounding systems that involves things like blockades blockade runners are useful here and pushing towards smaller squadron level combat being useful means of fighting a war sure you can drop your capitals next to the hub and try to take it down in a classic manner but the hub should be something that take an investment to setup so why not just blow it to bits because once it runs out of critical supply a b or c slaves water or holofilms   the population gets fed up and lays down its arms allowing anyone to come and take the hub over with a few marines  another option may be an assault on the hub and planet itself using your own marines as ammo against theirs could have a basic rockpaperscissors mechanic where marine type a is good against b show is good against c who is good against a just some thoughtscsm how did it fair in the meeting 2 weeks ago

i gather there is no lcd support and i havent tested this yet but can you currently bind text to your macro keys and then use them in the chat windows once youve selected the appropriate window ive been thinking of binding a couple of short messages to answer common questions i see when logged into an alt in one of the starter corporations ive only just gotten the g15 so im yet to figure it all outto be more on topic i dont see this as a game breaking idea  it would be rather cool to see my skills train up when im alttabbed out of eve or i dont want my character sheet open for example  but obviously im biased because i own a g15

yep luv the nerfing
oyou cant have a vote about foty though not when it has been in the game so long all the people who were late on the band wagon but still made the effort to train all the skills needed to pwn will vote against a change

sounds like fun
i didnt really like the idea until i saw this consumableno fueling  excellent
be annoying as hell but very evil
there is a fundamental problem it can be abused by squatters and farmers basically this will make it to farmers can with out fear drop one of these and not need to fit a cloak and be invulnerable i mean catching farmers is already hard enough so i would want something included to make this not just a ratting station
man i get sick of hearing how farmers will use this and that to their advantage as a point against any good ideas being brought forward its a really bad case cutting off your nose to spite your face why would you let farmers dictate how you play the gamerhetorical
so basically a magic giant secure container that cloaks ships around it and allows me to refit hell ya where can i get 50 of thesei would prefer it not to be a cloak shield if you want to cloak fit a cloak but would support an antiprobe shield with an extremely tiny initial signature radius that increased as more larger ships were protected this will provide small groups of players who want to make a limited break into 00 a viable option of doing so to wage asymmetric war you would simply use more of these devices to protect larger groups than could be safely accommodated by a single unitif the unit functioned like a gsc in terms of being able to assemble it in station fill it with a few days supply of fuel throw it in an industrial or blockade runner and then anchor it up that would be cool keeping the combined fuel and item storage amount under the size of a regular gsc prevents it from becoming another haulers exploit as they double up on fuel  mineralsi like the idea of not being able to anchor it anywhere and would definitely favor at least a 5000 km noanchor zone to prevent pinheads from putting it off gates and thus using it as a gate  station camp mechanism i dont think any other anchoring restrictions should apply other than the ones already in place for anchoring gscs
i would go back to 00 for thiswould also make using black ops easier you can jump to a system and refuel at the cloaked pos
allow me to respond to your rhetorical question how could you change the concept so it isnt super effective fro ratting answer design the anchorable so once you enter it you are only cloaked for so long say 5 mins then once you leave the structure you cannot cloak for long enough to be probed out if you dont move this would still allow for this spot to be a pounce and place to refit with out being a hiding spot where you cant be probedjust an example of how you could make it not as beneficial to farmers
heh kasheen im sure the flaws would get ironed out eventually like everything else so why break a format 
when jf can jump to highsec they become invulnerable most of them get caught with their pants down undocking in 00 or lowsec or get ap ganked in highsec its inconsistent when they can jump out highsec but cant jump backbesides just like pirate faction towers you can tweak this idea around in a way that you need highstanding with the highsec faction youre jumping to and have to be in a deccable corp
never ceases to amaze me when people take potshots and attempt to disrupt valid discussions by subtle personal attacksjump freighters have a great deal of risk if they are allowed to jump directly to high sec the risk only gets slightly lessin reality all youd have to do is wardec the corp that owns the freighter and you can nail the target as it arrives without much troubleunless its a npc then you have a valid point of riskless thereeither way all i see is 2 groups one who wants less frustration as they are going to and fro 00 to high secand a bunch of gankers who want meatier targetsif its going to be a problem then have a cyno tax for jfs crossing into empire space after all its the only capital ship allowed to come in unless i didnt count the roqual spyou could even use charters and make them verrrrrrry pricey where you could avoid the fee by taking the risk in lowsec
no it isnt you can jump to lowsec you can jump to nullsec but you cannot jump into highsec its not about where the ship originates its about where the cyno is the only thing the jumpdrive cares about is there being a cyno in range not where it the jumpdrive currently is
hi there forum peoplethis is basically 2 suggestionsissues which is bugging me1 being able to set pos to use alliance wide standings apply as well as corporations also a corporation with a different standing than alliance should take the alliance standing this could also be applied to outposts this doesnt have to be default settings but optional settings to make it easier as far as i have understood pos and outpost actual standings are corp to corp based and with lack of standing exchange system and limited standing slots its room for improvements this would improvea nbsi alliance corps dont have to put every corp into the friendly list to make their pos not attack unwanted targetsb nrds alliances will be able to set their pos to shoot reds even if the standings are not towards corporations c all alliances can have alliance wide standing and due to standing slots dont have to set standing to every corp instead only need to set standing towards other alliances2 launch a pos for yourself or being able to assign a posparts of it to a specific person this could be done in the equipment management tab the settings here could only be changed by using an administration password set clarification you would need the administration password to make tower or parts of it set to individuals and also to take it back this would improvea security when buildingresearching since you could keep bpo in your own hangar at station instead of putting it into corp hangar and security for corporations dont have to give access to bpo storage divisions in corp hangar for members to be able to researchb safer docking of super capitals c this could be used to make different hangars personal hangars ie a few persons sharing a pos in a good ratting systems while dropping loot into their own hangard easier to allow corp usage of pos as they can not unanchor it and steal it
according to serenity an independently elected representatives board should cease to be independent were you drunk when this struck you as a good idea or are you an advocate of fascismthe sheer potential for abuse is so staggering that it would keep goons entertained for weeks in a sort of forum jihadswarm unless of course you wish to reword it to exclude those in goonswarm from being able to report people on the forums
adding complexity cost and time to fueling pos making fuel items also requiring factory slots iirc  do not want
where is complexityit is a needed feature
if you read all the responses in the ideas thread youll see that many of the players running large pos operation mainly in 00 are concerned the additional logistics steps in order to get all the components to a central point for manufacture of fuel rods which in essence are just containers for the pos depletables with no benefit beyond removing a simple ratio calculation for the individual itemsthis is compounded by the fact that the ice products have other uses for various capital shipsfleets and the current method at least gives you options of using pos fuel if necessary which wont be the case after the changefurther compounded by additional difficulty of groups working out of a pos where they would have to add a manufacturing step min 2 silos and a manufacturing array at the pos if they were sourcing ice locally in order to convert fuel products for the posand if you were buying fuel products your now going to be paying an additional cost for what basically a plastic wrap process with a better namebasically i see this dev idea as unnecessary and shouldnt be supportedas for this thread i would suggest that the op should have set it up a non support thread similar to the nanonerf threads next time if he wishes to discuss dev ideas
ccp isnt a bank
not supported very very very bad idea
the idea is foolish if you move a q20 lvl 4 agent for caldari navy into low sec and remove all agents from hi sec you will face 200 cnrs docking undocking from one stationit will be a nightmare for pirates even worse than factional war navy fleet then carriers and dreads will get involved low sec will become a massive blobsmart bombing festyou do not want to gank cnrs with your dread do you actually this change will benefit neither missions runners nor pirates it will become deathmatch carriers vs cnrs sneaky chinese farmers versus undock point gankers docking game fans bumping typhoons and that kindmissions improvements are welcome mission removal hardly so its the same as suggesting to remove all rat bounties and loot in 00

dont hold your breaththe minutes has to go trough ccp for approval
yes they are when you get out of optimal which isnt very big to begin with
errr what ive always been under the impression rsds hit after optimal at a reduced degree of strength but still hit they do  even if they have at some point little or no impact
way too many ships were made effectively useless by the rsd nerf something needs to be done supported definitely
the reason behind it is that having to constantly recalculate the strength of the sensor dampner would just cause the server to keel over and die and as a compromise to stop lag it was made to be a simpler chance based system
thats how they should really work but no in falloff all ew is chancebased ecm gets a falloff roll then a sensor vs jammer roll
major update my new nag comes out of the oven in like a weektaking bets on how many times i lose it before it gets buffed
againststop penalizing people who have spent well over a month to get into the best ships in game only to effectively toss that all awaythere are going to be a lot of people quitting probably myself included if all of the time i spent training vagas rapiers and all of the isk ive spent pimping polycarbd gisti crows just goes away like it never happenedflying the best ships takes a lot of time a lot of effort a lot of skill and a lot of isk that is what balances speedlearning how to avoid or counter attack nanogangs is a necessary feature in this game the same as learning how to counter the best weapons systems in real life is a constantly pursued goal by defense contractors
i also think that its absolutely laughable that a company so dedicated to roleplaying aspects of a game gives set laws of physics forces everyone to get used to them and then decides that they just want to arbitrarily change the laws of physics as if god would change the laws of gravity to make the olympics more fair for fat people
i am voting against the nerf of speeds even though i was for a nerf of ludicrous speeds in the beginning why because ccp seems unable to fix a broken aspect of the game without breaking others in the process nor do i like that they want to make the game easier for defenders and owners of space and drastically make guerrilla warfare less viablenozh mentioned that the speed was fine in 2004 and that i believe is the problem we have a dev with a 2004 mindset that want to drastically alter 2008and thats my reason why i cant vote yesedit forgot to klick the supportideathingy

precisely and why cant you put up a cyno in highsec for a nonaggressive commercial ship which promotes trade with the 00 and lowsec regionsif you watched the recent coronation video you could see that amarr had plenty of caps in highsec never seen some of their capital shipyards though
the rorqual fits that bill aswell
because any activation of a nongoverning faction cyno could bring in hostile cap ships as well as with a nonaggressive commercial ship with the factions at war any one of these so called commercial ships could be filled with explosives jumped behind enemy lines under false pretenses to ram itself into a station and blow it uprp ftw
local is a ridiculous intel tool indeed some sort of delaylike possibly 5 min you wouldnt show up in local if youre less than 5 min in the system it would work the other way too so you wouldnt see anyone that had been in the system for a while until 5 min after you jump in would be acceptableid prefer to remove local completely though and have the scanner modified so it would be more useful possibly make the scanner autoupdate in a way but only within normal scan range that way as a gang you would be able to sneak through systems without whatever random ratter there would relay intel to the rest of his alliance making surprise attacks on enemy home systems possible if they dont have dedicated scouts out

sb warpiong cloaked is not a high issue to me not even sure i want to be able to firelaunching while cloaked no you have tobe vulberable at some point launching a offencive defencive is one of those times totally agree that the bomb should det even if you recloak get killed its a bomb not a controlled device if i loose contact with the ordinence it still falls and still hit the last target i pointed it at price vs function if its a pos weapon it should cost alot less cargo size yeah keep it the same if you make it worth using i also support lower sec use 3 and lower for those grate pirate camps
upon entering a system with people in your fleet giving bonuses any siege warfare bonuses that grant extra shields must be recharged any armored warfare bonuses however are automatically applied without a need to repair or remote repair for shield tankers jumping into engagements soon after receiving bonuses this presents a problem where the bonuses cant be enjoyedi suggest that shield bonuses be applied in the same manner that armor bonuses are this is a significant disadvantage for people who rely primarily upon shield tanks without shield boosters or a remote rep nearby
i heartily agree
it would make more sense for the armor level to need repair than automatically fill the shields goons
then there would be absolutely no reason to train for bonuses at all no ones going to train for armor bonuses if it means you have to rep every single ship before an engagement
three counterpoints firstly this is the opposite of how every other shield hp addition works  be it onlining an extender gaining a rank in shield management or having a fleet booster leviathan enter local secondly armour hp buffs just add to hp whereas shield hp buffs add to tank as well due to passive regeneration being a time and not a rate you get more benefit than an armour tanker does you can suffer a drawback fairly thirdly if you care about hp i should hope your gang booster has both armoured warfare and siege warfare trained meaning that you get both effects and thus the difference between them is fairly narrow for most ships besides shields and armour are different as long as it all evens out and i think it does im not going to fret too much
it doesnt even out few ships fit armor reps or shield boosters in fleet pvp most tanks are purely passive tanks armor tanks are immediately granted a substantial buffer upon having bonuses applied while shield bonuses have to recharge every time you change systems with your gangif the shields had to charge up once after joining a gang and then stayed charged as you moved from system to system i wouldnt have a problem with that but having to recharge them every time you jump through a gate with your gang is pretty ridiculous
this is a good idea i am stupid and every time i get a shield bonus i think someone is shooting at me
yo sup joe dis a pretty neat thread u got goin on up in here dogg but man i dont know about dis reppin  dogg like its my body i do what i want you know
joe your stupid just get them to fill up the shields  buff  rather then nerf  make armor work worse
supported it takes a really long time for them to regenerate too since the last bit of shields always recharge the slowest
it would be a nice bit of balance
supportedno reason in the world that shields shouldnt be filled up after bonuses are applied doesnt matter if other modules dont work like that this is a basic balance issue
you cant just balance things for fleet pvp though people gang for small pvp and for missionscomplexes and you have to keep that in mind admittedly this isnt as relevant an issue for them as it is for fleets but it does have to be kept in mind that said your point about switching systems is a good one if you wanted to make a rule that bonuses linger for 30 seconds or a minute after somebody leaves system so that they can meet up on the other side and not lose hp id be in favour of that but it shouldnt come in full every time
support looking at the balancing of the siege warfare  armor warfare skills and bonuses mechanics

no you newbie
i love your many arguments against the issue and the strong reason behind them very well written post
remove local no free intel the game is meant to be fun
not unless a better onboard scanner is put into place
i agree having to scan every belt in every single system you roam through to find ratters would make this game more fun
i can see some changes to the game involving the removal of local that would be beneficial overall  a decent one was proposed a couple months backthe neural network thread a naked removal however would be a horrible idea dont eliminate it unless you replace it with a suite of other intelgathering tools which are at least as powerful in the hands of a skilled player
replacing it with a better way to get intel than we have right nowapart from local yes making it just as overly effective no
thats been the general consensus for the past several years ive played eve why the devs have completely ignored this aspect i have no ideahey bonus a great way to discourage blob warfare is to make it harder to know the opponents exact numbers by simply popping a scout in local
this is a godawful idea it doesnt surprise me that someone in a newb corp would suggest it locating people in a system take long enough as it is and demands good skills either with a directional scanner or good skills with probing simply knowing that theyre there is akin to a flight transponder or radar screen it makes perfect sense and allows people to know when to have fun and when to tred softly
this actually finding a target takes long enough im not in support of this unless whatever replaces it actually tells you someones in there i could live with it not telling you exactly who was in there and just listing the number of people in system even with that itd completely mess up empire wars good luck sifting through 100 ships to try and find out if a wartarger is in local or not local would simply have to stay around in highsec
if local is removed how will i let opposing gangs know that they are babies and that i had intimate relations with their mothersedit where would i fofofo
replacement mechanic would be awesome but removing local is a stupid idea
indeed it does
local shouldnt be removed until a new effective method of gathering system intel is put in place and actually implemented and working ingame not a second soonernot supported

remove localadd autojoin to constellation channel or in other words make local  constellationadd a simple number to the top left that shows how many pilots are inside all the stuff listed there system constellation region that would give us even more general intel data but less preciseconstellation is also better for local conversation for everyone but belthugging minerns and mission runners and you can still converse with friends and foe alike even better than now

racial isotopes liquid ozone and heavy water need to stay but having to use all 8 fuels ed me of there is no need for there to be more then 3 or 4 fuel types
much like custom channel motds alliances which have sov 2 in a system should be able to set a system motd which would be displayed upon entry
hi im winchestori and i support this ade thumbs up
good plan
what could go wrong with this
this is a change that we can all believe in
i endorse this service
why yes ccp should spend their time programming this instead of solving the issue with node crashes fleet lag and how my overview window gets all screwed up the moment i undock
dont complain theyre working on it
i actually rather like this low priority but itd be cool to see
i like this idea a lot it provides another entry point for playerbased game building while providing a nonmechanical way for people to feel the significant effect of their alliance achievementsi say proceed
this is a fantastic idea almost like a player controlled concord billboard
system motd yes lowpriority fluffpob player owned billboard hell no especially for those who are evil enough to place it at the warpin of the gate
this is an excellent idea

what exactly is the csm saying remove lag plz going to accomplish ccp is well aware of the lag issues and those lag issues are an inevitable consequence of trying to have 500 people involved in a battle this isnt some simple issue of turning the lag switch off where all the csm needs to do is ask for it no amount of whining is going to make the hardware issues go away and even ifwhen ccp manages to find a solution to the current lag players will simply start bringing bigger and bigger blobs until they hit the new server limitas for useful or not the real test will be the nano nerf if the csm gets an alternate idea for the final nerf it will have done its job if ccp just ignores their advice as i suspect they will it will be painfully obvious that its nothing more than a publicity stunt
the amount of whine is too much to go with my cheese in this thread tbhthe csm whilst having flaws in its first ever run did its job and that is bringing issues in front of ccp that matter to players instead of them having to sift through tons of crap whine posts like this to get to actual good info they could usedoes it mean i like the csm now not reallyoh so that means i dont like the idea of the csm and that it should just be thrown away since its useless no eitherthe csm is a far better option than having ccp getting the wrong idea from the stupid amounts of noise and whines on the forum
i already see a massive response to the second csm maybe well get actually 400 people to vote
patience grasshopper i dont think ccp has approved the candidacies yet  when that happens i would expect to see a lot more campaigns begun in earnest
of course a month later clinton and obama had both launched its a rule of elections  the nonames launch first because they need to make a splash to stand out from the crowd because theyre hoping to use the extra weeks or months to build momentum or because they dont understand how easy it is to be forgotten when youre talking before anybody is listening look again in a week or two and tell me that theres no response
the problem with the csm as i see it isnt that it hasnt done anythingbut that it hasnt been seen to have done anythingccp has not given it a chance to validate itselfand as such needs to do something visual for the rank and file
amen ive trained through all the learning skills nearly three times now at best having basic implants right away wellspread stats its 45 days of wasted game time at worst its the 1 reason why people burn out and there are so few that make it past the 1 year mark i used to be of the opinion that they were a choice didnt need them and they should remain ive since grown up from such childish nonthinking ultimately there are two things to consider for an mmo growth and retention learning skills run counter to bothheres my solution ccp should sell characters that come with all of the basic learning skills at lvl5 and the advanced learning skills at lvl4 for 3050 the cost of the 15 wasted months of game time  additional markup price gouging now instead of blowing cash on power of 2 and grinding two characters through 2 months of wasted time they can spend it on one character and start playing instantly they also are not advantaged over people who actually took the 3 months to train the advanced skills to lvl5 i know this is unfair to people who have low incomes but its the best crackpot solution i can invent given my knowledge of mmo bottom lines and the absolutely terrible gamekilling solutions that actually get adopted nerf nerf nerf hahaha its all fixed nowi can tell you that ccp is not going to remove their precious money sink skills though theyre so damn scared of modifying their skill tree bonuses notwithstanding that its become the disorganized mess we know and love hate today
eve is all about mining veldspar for 6 months griefing veldspar miners for another 6 and then blobbing from then onand growth and retention are the key elements to the mmo business or did you forget that ccp is trying to make a living off you its in their interests to increase bothedit and the only thing complicated about eve is fitting your ship once youve got that figured out a total of 1 week learning right there tops you warp in hit your win button warp out repeat as necessary replace ships as required
if youre needing to replace ships at all then you badly need a better win button either that or its not quite as straightforward as you make outim mostly looking forward to the next csm elections so this post can finally die the death it deserves only posting in it again now because its already at the top of the forum so im not bumping it
you eventually need to crawl out of the ibis or if youre the 50 that didnt roll caldari like the rest of us one of the other three ships from there you will probably want to get something larger than a frigate unless you love frigatesthen theres also the portion of people that pvp in this game i know its shocking but apparently people do it unless that pvp is waged only against people hopelessly outclassed and outnumbered youre eventually going to lose a ship of course we could all gather round the largest veldspar we can find in our hulks and sing kumbayaand i was unaware the sole purpose of the csm was censorship of unpatriotic thinking sounds a bit communist to me can i be a bluecap id much enjoy going around throwing posters into gulags
im running for csm im a long time eve player focusing and primarily experienced within the null sec life spherei have done pretty much everything within this game at one point or another from mine to mission to run a reaction chaini consider myself to be an honorable player and i value above almost all else things like intergrity and trusti know this game and i love this game soask away with you questions on all my various beliefs and see if im your man
why did you join razor
eve mail him and stop derailing this thread vily is a good man and will do great as a csm massive respect vily o7
its a good question it establishes the type of player he is
i assume youre joking but in case youre not qa was the primary purpose of these threads in the last election  it isnt just a campaign platform its also a town hall meeting its far better this way than starting a why did you join razor thread separately  which if you wanted it answered publicly would be necessary
i didnt ask him to start a new thread i dont understand what a town hall meeting is on a forum can you explain it to me please sorry i am new to computers and forums
town hall meeting is a political term not a forum term the idea being a spot where the candidate goes to a town hall and gets asked large numbers of question by ordinary people instead of a more conventional interview or debate where all the questions come from one person what i meant by it was that this is a forum thread accessible by anybody and as such its a spot where people go to ask direct questions of the candidate questions for all candidates tend to be asked in separate threads but if i wanted to ask specifically vily somethingas the above poster did then id ask it here and youre right in that the question could be asked by evemail but if the questioner wanted to ask the question publicly itd basically have to be done on the forums also the text length limits on evemail is even more punishing than it is on the forums so if the answer was long itd require several mails as such for most questions of a candidate the right place to ask them is on the candidates thread  ie right here
a multitude of reasons rzr is a well organized and stable entity within which i know the leadership and have a good base of freinds i wanted to get involved in the conflict up north and i like the underdog i like places where i can help and make a differencei also enjoy capital warfare theoretically and to do so a large style alliance like razor usually provides good opportunities for that
thank you for the frank answer to my question it seems these days people like to troll geniune questions on forums and your attitude is refreshing to say the leasti never lived in a town so i guess the term went over my head i do however see how it works now thanks to your insight with this in mind i would like to ask vily this do you believe that ccp should add more lvl 4 missions in high sec to alleviate lag in mission hubs
if been a member of the csm and been a member of a corp or alliance conflicted with each otherwould you give up said alliancecorp
what kind of stuipid question is this i mean there are goon csm members geese get a grip on reality
its a question of commitmant to the csmwhich in their minds is the most importantcorp alliance or the csm
a good question and one every candidate should be askedbefore i vote for someone i want to know who they represent me or their corporation and alliance

how about a systemwide doomsday pos module that only affects hostiles
um going to vote no however if there was a way to make destroyers have a cloaked ship sonar sytem id be all forit system wide going with no no and hellno i say this as a sb pilot mind you
ive seen 4 power of 2 promos in my time in evethe first 3 of course werent in dire global financial restraintsstill hasnt changed why i would not spend more than 1 accounts worth on the game not counting my reasons for doing so either
this csm will be just as fubar as the last onebecause the big alliances have to much influenceevery idea is viewed towards maintaining the status quonew player corps and single account players are strangled which is why so many fail or leave the gamethis as got to be the hardest game to get a start in unless you have a mentor and or previous experiencethe role of the csm should be to promote the game not private or corpalliance agenders
posted by elric of gallachthe problem with the csm as i see itisnt that it hasnt done anythingbut that it hasnt been seen to have done anythingccp has not given it a chance to validate itselfand as such needs to do something visual for the rank and file
lockednonconstructive
not every alliance with sov 34 in their space have the numbers at other peak times to fight off say a 20man camping of ones station or attack on a pos when no ones onlineexample a usuk based alliance losing a pos to an ausnzasian based group and losing just because they have to force themselves to stay upwake up early to fight them off many would rather just not play in this case which means less revenue for ccp and we all know how they can react when it means theyre losing moneynot every alliance with any sov for that matter have 247 slaves attached to their eve clients staying on station to provide securitysome people have lives beyond eve
cant think why irc would be interested in this sort of thing
is there a small gang giving irc some trouble or something
could be could be
i think this was on the drawing board at some point but since jump bridges put an end to 90 of gate travel then they werent really needed
i for one support this statement
ill take this as a compliment
no to gate guns  but i do like the idea of being able to place a couple around an outpost  controlled from within by a gunner
i do imagine that part of the responsibility of holding space in 00 was having to actually defend it made oh so much easier by the tools you already have hello system scanners and jump bridges
to be honest you should be able to defend your space without logging in for months and not having to sacrifice ships to the enemy
theres an idea i could go for risking taking considerable heat and radiation damage sensor scrambling em waves and potentially getting caught with your pants down in a desperate attempt to get a little fuel from the sun to make the next jump could consider it part of the tactical environment idea but i actually like that idea
i gotta find a tactical environment thread im really starting to like that idea
nice stuff love itthis isnt just for capitals but for black ops ships as well if anything black ops vessels would profit more from it  a boost they could use
as dark said above me its already hardly even profitable read not at all by comparison to mine ice instead of regular ores the last thing we need is a system where people can get fuel without even mining ice
the idea was that youd be too far away from your mining vessel to mine ice for fuel or anywhere near a station to buy it black ops definately tactical refuelling etc i likekeep the ideas comingarithron
so whats to stop people from doing this in their personally controlled lownull secs or even in high sec why mine ice when i can probably scoop the fuel i need 10x faster than mining ice which causes the problem it would have to take atleast double the time to get the fuel from a scoop than it would from mining it
it just needs to have a massive downside to it like really really large bursts of thermalem damage i guess relative to ship size otherwise blast big enough to hurt carrier would pop a black op and minimal returns in fuel make it so if a carriermomwhatever is caught harvesting from the sun its at a huge tactical disadvantage and can be easily destroyed that way the primary source of fuel will still be ice but if your a long way from home and short on fuel that sun might look worth the riskafter a little more thought best way to do it would probably be a high slot module long cycle time that prevents warp stops shield and capacitor from recharging makes ship unable to receive logistic support or something like that
you could make it require modules which use up slots that cant be used for something else could be enough of a downside when you need to add a highslot harvester and a medslot onboard refinery to your ship in addition to it being less efficient than ice mining of course
he he he i figured at least answer me this was the dead horse discussed if it was discussed we will hear at some point what the deal is that is all i want to know at this moment
i cant wait for a response to this either hope its good news would hate to see we lobbied for this for 2 years just to see it all go down the drain
it wasnt discussed directly due to ccps initial response however it was refered to quite a few times in discussion about other mechanics
this is a really good idea and really something that feels like eve 
well looking at ccps obsession with ambulation which is a completely unneeded feature from game perspetive and totaly ignoring this issue for well over a year i am not very optimisticseems to me that this horse will wither to dust before ccp even acknowledges the idea 
what you kidding me why were we not told the ccp response what happened are we getting screwed again by ccp why did not csm notify us as to the content of ccps response isnt csm duty to the players of this game and oversight the ccps actions and to bring suggestions you need to lay it all out for us there has been to many halfwords and double takes with regards to posdead horseccpcsm  this is the only issue i have seen thus far thoroughly ignored or avoided by ccp
no kidding thats a crock of crap wasnt directly discussed thats useful and what pray tell was this referred to from new sov system research thats a crap answer ccp is going to have a lot of mad poss runners if this doesnt go through or they dont explain why its not going to happen assuming its not
i say first major engagement
dont worry ccp will fix it
unfortunately you know you will be called primary right ps please ccp save yorda
i do seem to get primaried a lot but any decent fc wont primary a nag in a cap fight lowest dps high burst tank it only lasts for 12minutes but thats about as long as most dreads last in a cap fight anyway plus theyre like a giant marker of where the enemy cap fleet ispos shots on the other hand
i do not see how the ability to train skill during account inactivity is a so called advantage i strongly incourage a rethinking of this idea
its not advantageous to train a 30 day skill without having to pay for the gameskill training is part of the game to play the game you pay to train skills you pay
good change pay if you want to train your skills use your alt in a blackbird till you got him trained up for falcon
 ccp if they take this feature out im not playing this game anymore
thank you ccp
removing ghost training is a good thingpeople pay to play why should people be rewarded for not paying it makes no sensethe change is good in my opinion
this change will lose ccp some of my money ghost training isnt something i and most others do instead of playing its something we did as well as playingthe exception is people who have to be away from eve for a while that consoling phrase oh well at least you can set a long skill mate will no longer be there to encourage them to returnthey can have my cash for 2 accounts or the can have my cash for 2 accounts  2 ghost training accounts  about 50 more their choice reallyedit as for the mythical and never proven character farming  what the eff they just spent a year giving isk farmers every possible buff and protection now were supposed to think they care so much about character farming
just because its refreshing to come back into the game with a nice new skill when youve taken a break for a couple months
its ok ccp make sure that people who quit the game stay quit 
im sure theyll get right on reversing the changes due to this thread
well just for the record for the good it does
i will no renew my subscription to my third account if this goes through
but but but the csm isnt just a powerless circlejerk right right
i can clearly see why its a serious advantage of training up your char while not paying for your accountheck id call it an exploitccp loses money over such things because your ganking them out of there hard earned money in supporting this gamethats like saying ill train  level v which takes over 30 days and not pay for one month of eve onlineand then come back and reactivate the account and start paying for it but they dont get the one month backthats cheating the systemconvenient or not i support ccp in there decisionif your not going to pay for your account there should be a count down timer then everything on your account should just flat freeze glorified pause buttonwhen reactivated the account should pick up where it left offas for the timer 48 hours or something not too long to make it abuseable but long enough for someone to figure out where to get the cash to pay for it againsorry folks but putting a stop to an exploitable feature is something i want to seepeople who pay for this game pay to play it and train there chars on itif your not going to play the game just to train up your char you shouldnt be able to train up your char by not playing the game for extended periods of timeme emphatic thumbs down
4 days left until account canceled still left 33 days skill training
corrected that for youi see nothing wrong with this change why should people who arent playing the game benefit equally to those who actually pay to play makes sense that if an account goes inactive training should too
its just a suggestion but i would love for them to re do allot of the sound effects ect make them more movie like and a little less pac manyou know stuff like new gate jump noises and new laser noises a nice bass tone while your ships in space would be cool alsocheers
the game could definitely use some audio polish graphics have been improved a lot sound fell short so far
i vote noid be fine with the suggestion to make mwds turn off other modules like cloaks do as long as abs got a buff to helpno ship should ever be invulnerable but the nerf as described is doing it wrong
your market orders and research points should stop if the account is inactive after all with market orders up you can make money while your account is expired with research points you can continue to accumulate them while your account is expired and when you resubscribe you come back to a fat amount of rps that you can cash in for isk that is entirely inconsistent with the ghost training thingif ccp wants to remove ghost training then they should also remove market orders from inactive accounts and stop inactive accounts from acquiring rpsdividend payouts to inactive shareholders as well those should be stopped capsuleers who actively put their time and energy into working on their characters should reap the benefits of the game not inactive ones timexenergyprofit not timexinactiveprofit
supporting my idea
because it makes sense
this game isnt fun to play anyway we might as well make it worse rite ccp
if skill training suspension for inactive accounts is logical theres no reason why this shouldnt be alsoeditagreein wit dis
if ccp removes ghost training they should do this as well
might as well be fair and run this  into the ground across the board
this is logical to some extent more logical than removing ghost training which serves as a carrot to entice people to come back to the game if they have to leave for a whilei dont know about market orders though  im not a programer but it seems like it might be hard to do it in any way other than cancelling all orders and if your account lapses for even a day    well yeah
also character inactive for longer than a certain time period to be determined by devs of course should be deleted theyre getting to use db slots for free to the detriment of people paying for the game

well if ccp is going to move with the ghost training this only seems logical supported
yes if youre going to do something then you need to be consistent
not much else to say the value of rp items have gone drastically down with all these old unsubscribed accounts pulling them in a player just has to reactivate the account and has access to upwards of years worth of rp that kind of passive unsubscribed income must not be allowed

throw in a small meager timer for those who dont have money right now but can get it in 48 hours ish and you got my vote
proposal makes sense on the other hand you left out outstanding contracts presumably they should be cancelled as well if ccp want all or nothing than all or nothing it should be supported
or you could send the money to the scc or some such black hole which would make a great isk sink hole 
lrtsitg
short term yes first 30 minutes the lag will be worse look at a current double ddng which is as close a simulation to my proposal as anything only difference is that with double ddng the second dd does full damage while in my proposal the second wave of the titan would only do enough damage to remove wreckspods but most fights were titans are lagbreaking fightsnodecrashing fights ie fights that take hours upon hours a good second wave dd can then be beneficial for the longterm of the fighti agree thats why i proposed this idea to make doomsday only interesting to combat the lag and to remove all other benefits from doomsdayng ie the lootor otherwise told current situation2 fleets a lesser skilled pvp fleet with 160 peeps but with a titan in system a skilled pvp fleet with 80 peeps but without titan in system 80 battleships in the lesser skilled pvp fleet vs 40 battleships in the skilled pvp fleetthe 2 fleets go head to headafter 10 minutes in the battle the skilled pvp fleet are making headway in killing more hostiles then loosing friendlies 20 battleships of the lesser killed pvp fleet are killed for 10 battleships of the skilled pvp fleet  however far from being able to tell that the less skilled fleet will loose the battlehowever the titan pilot of the lesser skilled pvp fleet  doesnt want to take the risk that they will loose the battle and orders the friendly fleet to warp out so that he can warp in and dd the hostile fleet the hostile fleet looses the majority of its ships and the battle is over the lesser skilled pvp fleet warps back in and loots the field my scenario2 fleets a lesser skilled pvp fleet with 160 peeps but with a titan in system a skilled pvp fleet with 80 peeps but without titan in system 80 battleships in the lesser skilled pvp fleet vs 40 battleships in the skilled pvp fleetthe 2 fleets go head to headafter 10 minutes in the battle the skilled pvp fleet are making headway in killing more hostiles then loosing friendlies 20 battleships of the lesser killed pvp fleet are killed for 10 battleships of the skilled pvp fleet  however far from being able to tell that the less skilled fleet will loose the battlenow the lesser skilled pvp fleet titan pilot has to weigh the risks if he warps now in not only does he risk his titan but also he will remove all the loot from the field so instead he chooses to wait battle rages on 30 minutes in the fight 40 lesser skilled pvp fleet battleships are lost but also 18 skilled pvp battleships are lostthe lesser skilled pvp fleet sees now even less reason to dd the field if the skilled pvp fleet keeps loosing its own battleships at this rate they eventually have to retreat as they will not have enough firepower left to kill fast enough the less skilled pvp fleets battleships and indeed this happens 50 minutes in the battle 60 battleships of the lesser skilled pvp fleet are killed but almost all of the 40 battleships of the skilled pvp fleet are killed the skilled pvp fleet has to retreatthe lesser skilled pvp fleet holds the field and loots the proceedings no titan needed to be usedin summary with my idea the titan pilot will only warp in when the fight definitely looks lost from his side instead of always warping in
i like the idea but in my opinion the titan should be able to roast pods and wrecks as well as the ships they came from in a single blastif you can survive the dd then thats great warp away to rep or join your fleet but if you pop it should destroy your ship and wreck regardless but any excess damage left over from your ship should be applied to your pod and you may or may not survive that
ccp has already said they are looking at titans doomsdays in general to the effect of changing them i dont support this for the reason that it would elimate any money you could make by salvaging or looting the wreckno im not an appleboy alt
much to my dismay ccp has decided to move on this issue without the csm delegates debating the value of eliminating ghost training but leaving all other ghost activities in rp farming  market ordersi would have preferred smaller steps eliminating some of the absentee resource gains other than skill training again i dont ghost train i would have also liked to see some sort of guidelines to cover the occasional billing problem here and there that does often enough crop upsad that ccp will latch onto an idea from the players but will not discuss the idea they coopt with their customers in fact i think ccp has forgotten that in the end they are a service provider and we are the customers rile us at risk to your business in an already risky economy for you
agreethere is no good reason to allow unpaid accounts to gain skills
yes if youre going to do something you need to be consistent with it
i like it i can already think of lots of ways to use it offensively and defensively
i like this one  but 14 days is a lot imo  710 is enoughthe general concept is ok but it needs some tweaking still like better scanning options to start with
sounds interesting

lets say corp 1 wardecs corp 2 they pay like 2 million and thats it 2million is nothingmy corp has 5 standing with concord we are bestest friends but it only takes 2 million to make them turn on me even when i more or less keep my nose clean no piracy no resource stealing no anything i dont bother anyoneif concord can be bribed by people who concord hates for a measly 2million my being best friends with concord should mean i could pay 2million per week to concord to be perfectly immune to war decs but that doesnt make senseif concord is so corrupt they honestly should auction the wardec off to the highest bidder if im such a pain my enemy should be willing to pay 500million per week if thats what i will paythe auction can literally work the same way as normal auctions do 10 increase per bid this will give true value to how much corpalliance 1 will pay to wardec the bad person or at least in turn causing the enemy to lose funds to concord for continued safety
do you mean an alliance that simply can not claim sov interesting ideai think for us it would be an issue if we ever want to hurt cvas position in providence then we have to be able to break their sov that means sov challenging towersi guess a work around is forming a second alt alliance that runs the towers while the ushrakhan becomes this new nonsov alliance but it would need thinking about pos gunners would either be alts or mains moved out the ushrakhan to the other alliance which would be a similar issue to the one we currently have with fw  fracturing of the communityits an interesting idea but would need careful consideration
supported
ive always liked this idea give us a chance to actually catch cloaking isk farmers the constellation chat would replace local for intel could be very interesting
another option would be to make the normal scanner systemwide and autoupdate with a certain interval to remove the need to spam the scan button every 5 secthe downside of the systemwide scanner would be that it gets more inaccurate the further away you are from the object for example 50 chance to get wrong results at 20 au
this new 00 regionor 2 will be home to a new npc racethis new race will be natural descendants in neweden they evolved in this space they have very strong ships but no capital ships whythis region will be unique in that due to physics and proximity to the inner gobular cluster creating cynos will be impossible because of this they developed no capital ships and instead have slightly more advanced ships many of the designs very similar to rogue dronesthis race will have faction ships such as a rogue drones dominixthis race is faction neutral and due to only recently discovering they arent the only ones in neweden they dont trust anyone they hold no stance towards pirates or empires they also dont sell bpos for their ships these faction ships are only available at lp costthe rats are obviously rogue drones they may drop faction bpcs just as you might find a nightmare bpc the exploration complexes only obviouslywhat makes this fun is that it will be 00 fun without any capital ships
against no aliens ever one good thing about eve is no alienseve is all about humanity about our nature our expansion our greed our passion
i never understand that kind of mentality or rationality on the aliens will ruin eve type atitudenevermind the whole damn game is science fiction to begin withit just sounds stupidsorry but i keep trying to figure out as to the justification of that kind of mentalityafter all the galaxy was not inhabited by humans to begin with in reality we are the aliens thereanyway to be constructive if theres going to be a new ncpc race use one that already existsrogue drones

tier 3 transport would be ideal i think currently theres like no reason to train transport above 1no cloak option so it isnt used to get through blockade of any kinduse of cans would be reasonabletractor beam single would be best
ok so we have something on the overview that now shows you who is scrammingwebingdampening etc you why not have something for miners that shows which roid is already being mined you could even go further and show which one is being mined by your group and which one is being mined by somebody outside your group im sure it would be easy to code and would be a great help to all things minededit im not sure what more to add on the overview there should be a little icon next to every roid just like the icons that tell you who is warp scrambling you etc this icon will serve to show you if a roid is already being mined by somebody else that is its only purpose maybe it could even tell you who exactly is mining it in the tool tip when you mouse over it the icon could also be multicolored white for neutral green for corp members and purple for fleet membersthis helps in just that situation that you mentioned when you have a ton of people mining the same belt so they arent mining over each other mining the same roid is counter productive because if 2 people are mining the same roid and one person kills it before the other one whoevers mining lasers finish first gets all the ore and the other person doesnt get anything at present the only way to counter this is to carefully select roids in space that dont have a laser on them which is tedious and also can throw you out of alignment if youre clicking on a roid too fast and start to move toward it instead of selecting it or to just randomly pick roids on the overview and hope you dont overlap other peoplethis is an easy solution to the problem and a sure fire way to keep people from mining the same roid
i can see where your going with this but your idea needs refinementwhat happens if you end up in a area with a ton of miners chewing awayrefine it a bit for and you just might get some supportpardon the puns
mega carebear reporting in frankly theres no new content like missions that really make a difference you could create 5000 new missions 1000 lvl 4s and we will eventually memorize and know which missions we hate and refuse to do and which missions are good and the best ways of doing themindustry sort of is very dependent on pvp factor as its the pvp guys who destroy and use ships rogue drone dominix would be great something to really compete with the golem the minifreighter is happening most likely a method of moving rigged ships en masse is likely in the works also
for some of us that have a hard time getting an issue they order in the mail maybe ccp can put the eon magazine up for digital download as a pdf file like alot of rpg companies are doing ie drivethrurpgcom on a more personal note im currently deployed to iraq and can even if barely play and the last issue i ordered didnt get to me for almost 3 months thats about the time i was getting ready to order the next issue a digital download version of the magazine i can keep up with current events in the eve universe rather than read up on future updates that already have been implemented by the time i get the magazine and if it catches on just think of how much money would be saved due to printing costs if illegal downloading is a concern you could like drivethrurpgcom keep tabs on floating copies by use of secure watermarks ie customer name and tracking numberyes i keep referencing another site but i believe its good to have done my homework
i searched but did not find anything regarding the subjecti have played over a year and have multiple account which i have no intention of changing however i found out long ago that alts are near useless since only one character at a time can traini understand the reason behind this as a result of how offline training works and if everyone could have a three characters per account getting full offline training at the same time well everyone would have three characters per account just cause ok plus it makes good business to get more players to play multiple accounts instead of multiple charsi already know why it would not be fair to veteran players to now implement standard alternate character training and why a company would not want to do it from a financial standpointmy idea is simple and it makes the idea of playing alts more appealing even for those of us with multiple accountsok to the pointin its crude form if there were sliders on the character select screen that allowed one to select how much of the present 100 training is desired for any charactersone could take the default as is now and give one character 100one could give a main 75 of the training while trying a new race andor career combo on an alt with 25 training or 5050one could have a main running at 50 with two alternate characters at 25there are plenty of examples but i am sure all reading this get the ideafor those that care nothing for alts then keep the default 100 that you enjoy now for those of us that prefer to mix up our play styles roleplaying or immersion as times there is a slight training penalty when using multiple character but not the all or nothing penalty that currently existsthanks for your time now go explore the stars the universe awaits
actually i think this idea was implied but not clearly statedi think that would work it gives a balanced penalty for such an advantage and it woudlnt unbalance everything the only drawback of course is it takes longer to learnbut at least your alt doesnt become a toonim gonna wait for feedback before i give support
exactlyas it stands now one toon gets no learning compared to only taking longer to learn to avoid the penalty one can keep the default as is now with 1 char always getting 100 either way its balanced as we are still talking about the same amount of skill gain now for each account just give the player a choice as how to divvy up that skill gainedit  oooops this is still ledoro just didnt change my toon before replying
hey lets get rid of 12 years of school and give everyone diplomasseriously tho if you think learning skills are hindering you from playing eve youre obviously not playing it right anyone who has a new character and knows exactly what they want is definitely not a newbwhile learning the learning skills a newb can learn build on the skills heshe learned from the tutorial while building up a path to get future skills faster think about it what does a brand new character need before anything else iskwhenever i recruit new players to the game i tell them to learn the learning skills first and foremost while they mine roids to gain money before they decide exactly what they want their character be thats what i believe the learning skills are there for to give the character time to decide before they dump their hard earned isk into random skills that wont benefit them
i think the use of sensors or the evaluation of actual sensor data is almost non existant in eve and if it was it could improve gameplay immersion and tactical optionswhat i would like to see is a basic representation of the sensor systems a ship has beyond what the onboard scanner can do already the funny thing is that it is so immensely powerful that it can pick up and pinpoint anomalies as far as 5 au and scan half a solar system via directional scan yet it completely fails to deliver things much more simplewhat i am talking about is ship data not like the ship scanner which gives detailed data on fitted modules what i mean is the technically obvious stuffmassinertiapowergridcpu outputshield strengthmax capacitorsensor strengthmass should be obvious for ship scanners and even a few minutes of flight observation will give good data on the ships agility since the shields are projected from the ship and have strong interaction with almost everything they should not be hard to evaluate either powergrid cpu and capacitor maximum could likely be evaluated from the ships electromagnetic signaturemy concept is that you lock a ship open the onboard scanner select a specific option eg target profiling and wait the better you are with survey the faster it goes and if you got a real ship scanner installed youd get a massive bonus to both time and lod after the scan is done you get results just like with normal scanning where you get a list of target capabilities as listed above not 100 precise and always with a small margin of error but close enough to use it as tactical datathe great tactical option in this would be that you could actually learn something about your enemy not about the class of ship he flies that is obvious to the naked eye but every enemy is unique each ship influenced by a unique set of skills these skills impact ship characteristics so it should be possible to get a basic evaluation of them players can interpret the data any way they want to get intel either on the target in front of them or on the pilot inside of it tactical and strategic data beyond name race and ship class since only data that can reasonably be picked up by basic starship sensors is reflected only a fraction of a characters abilities can be evaluated from his ships stats and only a fraction of his ships capacity and potential is visibleit would also add more usefulness to the basic scan and survey skills beyond level 3 to learn salvageit would allow players to conduct actual intel gathering operations infiltrating enemy territory to gather data on their ships and pilots such data properly evaluated and analyzed is worth money and i know quite some people who would pay for some profiling on their enemies since the player only gets some raw data that includes a margin of error it is the players brains and creativity that make something of that data notice i did not include armor strength in my list of suggestions armor is not easily visible and likely hard to scan out it can be derived by an experienced player based on the ships mass thoughit would be possible to identify the tank in an enemy formation based on actual sensor intel given the intel player knows what he is doing instead of shooting the ship to find out it would add some more subtlety yet more depth to the game experience
do you mean to imply that this scanning would happen at longmeasured in au distances or would it be an ongrid thing if its the former this could be a very good addition to the pile of intelgathering methods intended to replace local and if its the latter i doubt it will have any real use at all  if theyre on grid you should be shooting not scanning
actually both would be an option and being on grid also doesnt have to include shootingrange could be included as a factor that affects the margin of error so that players could snoop out targets from a distance with lower result quality while get better results when close upbeing within vision range of the target also doesnt have to result in hostilities after all such intel gathering would work both at peace and at war in 00 and in empire between friend and foethe onboard ship scanner works while cloaked this could be the same case for this application cloaking could influence results margin of error tooactually the more options there are that allow intel gathering the better the more choices players can make to get fast  safe or slow  precise information the better i think the whole intel issue is incredibly important because it gives options to those that want to play the mm part of the game instead of just the o part
just an idea for those of us that use two monitors in eve if it would be possible just to make the control area ie the part where you choose the speed of your ship and all that stuff moveable i dont see how that could be all that hard of a change but then we could move it from the middle off to the side or somethingplease visit your user settings to reenable imageslinkythat thing if i still wasnt clear enough
possible mechaniceach ship hit by a bomb explosion releases a secondary explosion proportional to ship size thus lots of small ships would release lots of small explosions that probably dont reach their gang members while lots of large ships would release lots of large explosions that probably do reach their gang members thus failure to spread out  death blobs can be killed small gangs are pretty much unaffected large fleets are still viable but need to spread out to survive sbs gain a purpose in fleet warfaredisadvantage probably harder to compute secondary explosions should probably be instant and nonvisible could be used to kill pos so should not do damage to static installations could be exploited via making a fleet with a ton of alts blowing a bomb and stacking the explosions somewhat unlikely though since alts would need larger ships to make reasonable explosion sizes thus newlycreated rookieship alt fleets would add essentially no damagesecond possible mechanicmines mines are launched mines sit in place the longer the mine sits the higher the damage mines are triggered when the duration runs out or the sb pilot launches a trigger thus mines are a get away from that object you see the mine you run in the opposite direction or die should be reasonably cheap and easy to get away from the explosion but devastating to be caught when the timer is up timer should be 30s1min or so breaks blobs with the run away factor gives sb pilot a tactical decision blow the bomb or make the fleet get further away from itdisadvantage not as good as solution 1 but easier to compute should not do damage to static installations
looks like someone didnt train their reading skills
this
hasnt this been proposed beforemy arguments against it are in another threadab
create a npc backbone to fluctuate and grow as normal perhaps with ccp able to tweak according to storylinethe market history for example can show the history of the stock prices and other details for the stockssome newb with an obelisk shifting around t2 mods and such creating profit can put himself on the stock market perhaps theres some super rich people who could drop 100mil on this stock at high risk the guy turns out to be legit your money in dividends returns advertise and tell your friends show them the history they drop 100mil also now this obelisk guy has a couple billion to use which he puts to good use eventually that person builds credit for himselfin real life people spend money on penny stocks all the time for the risk they might drop some on microsoft alsorisk vs reward i know ricdicif hes still around and others have billions and billions and could hear of an obelisk trader not care about 100mil and go for itnot only thatccp themselves can develop indexes of their own the ccp industrial index could be mixed around putting isk on the long term solid people who are established already with rep they could throw npc corps in the mix and also be kind enough to throw scrap money off to higher risk people in the attempt to create the ability for legit people to get startednot to mention traders can start from scratch buy their own stock and such and show good repyes creating the stock market or at least establish a new part of the normal market for stocks would be quite the undertaking but i think it certainly isnt just for a fewnot to mention it isnt just for industrial people goonfleet corp could put up stocks and their stocks could fluctuate based on how well they are doing if they take heavy losses and have to pay for ships their stock drops etc etc
how about introducing a new outpost in of itself which is dockable and such a tactical outpost which would have no sciindustry and market the players and property that is inside automatically is destroyed upon the destruction of said outpost or perhaps an outpost wreck which stores all of that in itlink these destructible outposts to sovereignty instead of pos price them accordingly
also please use more ice harvested fuel and less npc bought fuel

i havent seen a situation where this would apply but in such case i would yes be forced to drop either my corpalliance or csmi have made similar decisions before once with a character i was using to help friends all of a sudden being in an alliance which we were planning hostilities against i despite wanting to help my friends resigned that character from the alliance so as not to have conflicting interests
1 local has to stay sadly unless you are willing to accept a gigantic game shift i will never forget after a patch a year or two ago local was gone pirates and 00 players were having a feild day but it was only enjoyable because we knew it was temporary local represents the predominant player scanning method within eve without accompany changes to the scanner system changes to things like constellation chat and providing some part alternative to player listing then it makes 00 life impossibleso i think it should stay but id love to see some modification to it2 the debate about pos wars is probably the largest ongoing debate about change within eve atm based on the fact that it covers massive fleet enounters capital usage the dreadnaught ship class territorial control and rare resources access i currently think there are imbalances in some parts of eve that create imbalances in others if we had a perfect world within no lag then my concerns would be directed at cynojammers i would also have issues with things like mass cap blobbing and the ability to use said cap blobs to control large asset related ie moons portions of the map that they would otherwise be averse to controlling within the real eve however just being able to fight under the circumstances we have is a major issue dynamic load balancing and reinforced nodes becomes major issues and how to apply them correctly without changing how the fight will unfold3 i think that the nano changes as they are coming in are hard hitting a problem that is smaller than some people believe nobody with a hint of common sense can say that polygistisnakeboosterrogueskirmish linkedoverdrivesnanofiber fitted ships were balanced polys needed a nerf and so did snakes did the whole of speed engagement fighting no the nerf hits guerilla tactics much harder than it should i have yet to playtest other parts of the patch with regard to medium dronesapparently and web changes but i think in the end players will adapt as they always do my only real fear being that falcons will become more prevelant after this pso i think it was a little to much although partly needed but players will adapt in the end and the whiners will find something new to complain about in short order 4 as seen in the campaign into delve and within bobs max campagin the larger the territory the harder to defend the smaller the territory the easier to defend with titans involved once you hit a certain point of systems left it becomes extremely difficult to make any progress as it stands atm as well critical mass to successfully hit a cynojammer with acceptable losses is about 30rr bs meaning that to make progress in hostile space you need at least 3040 people to hit a jammer that is going to receive zero defence so yes i think the game heavily favors the defender mind you i think it should favor the defender but not so much as it currently does
you got my 3 votes robet although seriously razor

hmmmm one minor detail thoughi hope stuff like lp and standing stays out of the pictureyou know a lot of amarr  caldari pilots with good soe standingdidnt think so
according to ccp representatives at the meeting this weekend ccp is doing quite well one may posit that this is because the majority of their income is in foreign currencies as opposed to the isk as long as that continues to be the case i dont think theres much room for concern though the employees in iceland may have a harder time obtaining anything that isnt a fish or water bybroduct
theoretically when your home currency value decreases and your revenue is from internal streams you increase revenueso until icelands currency rebounds ccp will be making more money than they normally do
me too if there is an exploration ship i would suggest that it is not a new type of class from the existing empires instead its probably better done in the same way as ore doing the mining ships if we consider this as a starting point we can start to look at what we want  need on therefor a start and this to me would be a balancing point perhaps no covert ops cloak its not a covert ops so if you want to warp about cloaked you can use a covert ops also a low sensor strength like the marauders would make sense its computer systems being dedicated to exploration jigery pokery giving it no real downside in combat exploration yet diminishing its pvp usesif we can agree on these proposals we could scetch in some basics need highs for probe launcher mids for electronic gadetry and drones seem reasonable given its role anyway just a few thoughts
big alliances you say well yeah theres two goons on there but the others are from cva star fraction ivy league electus matari the ministry of information the conservative shenanigans party and the federal defense union only four of those are even real playerrun organizationstwo are tiny shells one is a npc corp and only one of the seven has any sovereignty and on top of that the chair is about the most antistatusquo person i can think of  he got elected on flipping 00 upsidedown and has repeatedly brought forward suggestions for doing so and successfully passed them through the council and while i admit that im not privy to their internal debates ive never heard any of them say anything about being antichange or about deciding that they were going to vote against something because it would negatively effect them personally human nature being what it is theres probably been a bit of selfdelusion on that last score but its still been quite good on the whole
good then because isnt that the way things should be
this its crap like this that is breaking the bubble known as player democracyand ccp i know that the csm where never supposed to have any power over game design and its purpose are only to present the opinions of the player base but what happened to the open dialog that you advertised as ground breaking steps towards an virtual democracy all i see is a csm that has its hands tied behind its back being forced to refer to the dead horse in related discussions as it apparently was not allowed to be discused directly
you misunderstand its simply toohardbasket technically for ccp to rewrite and regenerate art work to make it happen so we refered to it in other proposals such as small anchorable structures  where there is no existing artwork so that at least removes one barrier
supportseriously wtf ccp
ok imma sum up all the reasons why ending ghost training is dumb right here so people can refer to them all in one big tldr1 it has been referred to as a feature of the game see any of the twenty posts in the first pages of the dev blog discussion thread for a link to the player guide obviously in addition to being a contributing factor to people subscribing to the game the cancellation of which will obviously result in canceled accounts and possible loss of future customers this also spells out that ccp is being intentionally deceitful as to their reasons for terminating ghost training2 because a player works in eve to make money not to gain skill points there is no undue advantage provided to inactive accountsin eve skill points are acquired by clicking a button then coming back in a few days to click another button and train a different skill there is no hard work involved instead work in eve is used to acquire isk which can even be used to bypass the timesink that is skill training by purchasing more advanced characters a good metaphor is that of two players todd and frank todd lets his account lapse training carrier v while frank keeps it subscribed while training the same skill however over the course of a month frank works hard to earn isk at the end of the month both characters can fly a carrier but frank having worked hard and paid his subscription actually has the carrier3 ccp gains more money from the subscriptions of multiple sporadically subscribed ghost training accounts than a single perpetually subscribed accountthis one is simple math lets return to todd and frank todd runs two accounts over a year both of which are lapsed and ghost training for three months out of the year while frank runs a single account subscribed for the entire year assuming they both pay in one month intervals of 1499 per monthtodds accounts 17940  075  2  26910franks account 17940  100  1  17940therefore in addition to not being played for three months out of the year thus reducing strain on ccps servers however little todds two ghost training accounts bring in more money than franks single permasubscribed accountthere are other reasons but most of them are on a casebycase basis and i figure three massively glaring flaws should be enough to warrant a change of plansfurther tldrpreventing ghost training is bad for ccp many accounts are cancelled and some accounts are never created at all resulting in less moneypreventing ghost training is bad for players the true advantage in ghost training is given to permanently subscribed players who are constantly earning isk and making more money than ghost training players while gaining skill points at the same rate
and a quick counterpoint people who pay to play the game have one massive distinct benefit over someone who isnt paying they get to play the game i pay to play spaceships online not progressbar online its not as equal as one would think
thisalso i read the player guide as this is the how the game works not this is how it is intended or this is not a bugccp has always reserved the right to change anything about their gamefor example i will use pos bowling as it was ok then declared illegal if pos bowling was in a player guide it wouldnt mean that pos bowling was intended but merely that is how people played the game and that is was doable and a normal tactic when pos bowling was declared illegal said hypothetical pos bowling player guide entry would be amended or deleted seems like a normal thing to doonce again you are twisting a simple factual statement in the player guide and making assumptions on it it is simply stating what is possible not what is supposed to be
id say its a pretty reasonable assumption that when ccp lists information in a player guide its done so so that players can then use it as it stands ccp is suggesting that ghost training was always an unintended bug  essentially an exploit in the same vein as pos bowling however unlike ghost training pos bowling has never been used to sell accounts nor has it been specifically cited in a player guidewhich is the bigger leap that information is there with the intention of being used and cataloged as a feature or that a known exploit would be listed for yearsedit looking back on my post i see its a lot of circularreasoning words based on the fact that vaals assumption is completely unfounded here let me sum it up betterno guys were just writing all about it here so you know what it is no we dont want you actually to use it no stop what have you done ignores it for a few years
this was a change that needed to be made and i say that as someone who exploited the hell out of the old systemgallente cruiser v drone interfacing v gallente battleship v and advanced weapon upgrades v were all trained by me while unpaid it was a system i used to good effect but that doesnt change that it was a bad system the one thing i look forward to especially is that this removes onedumb but still frequently used argument against skill queues no skill queues will not allow a player to come back to a maxedout dreadnought pilot after a onemonth subscription and three years of waiting
the thing is that the only reason skill queues may be added after the removal of ghost training is to appease an angry player base not because removing ghost training was a prerequisite of establishing a queue hint clear the queue when an account is canceled problem solved if an argument is dumb ccp shouldnt even think about using it as justification
when you can sell a character for billions of isk that you have been training forever without having to pay is well broken i do understand that for those people who simply cant pay for whhatever reasonwell it could be worseyou could altogether lose that characterit would be within ccps rights to do sothe fact that ccp has allowed this for 5 years and almost promoted it as a desirable feature is the real problem here
i dont want to see this go and i approve of moustache mcgees message
this change is useless and unnecessary
i didnt claim ccp used the argument i dont recall them ever doing so fools on the forums used that argument it doesnt make a huge difference that they cant but its nice to see it go away nonetheless and id like to see queues be implemented on the grounds that they should have been there since beta but ill take what i can get
to quote wrangler in the stickied csm meeting threadso i dont think youre gonna be getting that queue any time soon regardless seeing as how you logging in and working hard to get those skills switched is one of the reasons subscribers are supposed to have an advantage over ghost trainers if ccps been unable to find a good system for implementing a queue ghost trainings removal will have absolutely nothing to do with it
after reading the blog and both related threads im against the change
gonna cancel my alt and just run 1 account now
kill it in order to save the company or dont i dont really care itll be fun to watch idiots go broke
disclaimer i do not have an alt i have not played in 3 months and have been paying the whole timedear ccpget off your lazy asses and deal with the isk farmers read anyone name xghgjsfdj or similarly ingame instead of killing your profits with your flawed marketing moves sincerely the people who are about to give their stuff or not lol to someone elseps fire the r3tards in marketingnow instead of getting 15 every other month or so from alt owners or even people who take breaks once in a while theyll get nothing brilliantif this goes through im going to jettison every single corpse i have right outside jita 44 right before i cancel my account
yes thank you ccp 
bug or not something that has been in the game this long that this many players feel strongly about should not be changed
no support here i really dont see whats wrong with asking people to pay their subscriptions while training skills
less money for them is whats wrong that and i cant take a break for a month to train a 30 day skills after paying the 3 months before training all the 312 day skills for it not only are people most likely not coming back after taking said break or not renewing their alts there are far more pressing matters at hand like isk farmers lag and fixing the ui but no lets fix the ghost training instead in a feeble yet flawed attempt at making more moneyid like to meet the dev that though this was a good idea so i could give him a nice punt kick in the ass with my steel toed boots
it has pros and cons really if you look at the big picturepeople that have to go away from eve had something to return for their longrun skill finishingon the other hand there are people creating a bunch of alts while strategically letting them lapse until theyre ready to like be sold off or gather research points while the account is not paid for eitheri understand ccps reasons but i think the problem is inherent in the way the skill system is done in that there is no way to progress your character in game no way to catch up with older players and spending your first month only training those darned learning skills of course whatever is changed to the skill system now is going to result in a whine just as big as this one isin its current form all of this sounds like a money grabthats why i want two things from ccp in return for this nerf30 day gametime codes back nowa skill queue
this will only make quitters not come back any more
good move to make less subcribers 
maybe you should delete inactive accounts too 
the skillsystem was one of the main reasons i played eve if i have to pay for looking at the progress bar then i can go and play wow too its the same therethanks ccp after 3 years in the game im fed upedit and btw why arent you disabling multiaccounting too i think its a bug in the account creation system
its a good move to remove the train while you dont pay ability it never made a lot of sense and really only benefits the experienced altmultipleaccount crowd widening the gap between casual and dedicated players even furtherit is a poor move to do so after by their own words many people started to use this feature if the game has this bug for so long so much that many players start actively using it to their benefit you will  off a lot of people if you suddenly remove the featuremore of a proactive and less of a reactive policy would work wonders for pr in that respect
actually my prediction for the future especially if eve does not increase its rate of growth is that the pool of older characters for sale will grow and grow and thus will get cheaper and cheaper more and more beginning players would be tempted to sell a couple of gtcs and buy these characters thus the proportion highsp characters and lowsp characters will continue to shift effectively making lowsp players an insignificant minority and the need to buy characters greater and greaterall these people who might decide to discontinue some of their accountsalts some might decide to try and sell them or even move them to their main accounts increasing the amount of available highsps
loli love eves skill system because it doesnt require me to gridnthe fact that nonpaying accounts still had skill training going on always struck me as more of a bug then anything elsei mean seriously what is the fuss about yeah it forces you to pay for the 4 alt accounts all training skills who you dont play but i dont see anything wrong with that for accounts you play on youre going to keep them subscribed and actually play the game
how about making the change at only 48 hours notice directly after running a promotion to encourage people to start a second accountand then lying about why they did itand then lying about it being a bugand then deleting proof that they lieddo you see whats wrong with thoseim mildly peeved about losing ghost training i wont bother with my dread alt any more ccp will lose the 3 or 4 1month subscriptions it would have taken to train him and and the 20 euro transfer fee and i wont get a dread alt to help support my alliance ccp and i both lose out here i guess ill have that account as insurance in case anything happens to one of my mains or maybe ill win the lottery and have the time and money to manage another active account who knowsim absolutely incensed by the highhanded dishonest and extremely disrespectful way in the way that ccp removed ghost training first we were fed some utter guff about game balance and complaints then they tried to claim that inactive characters place a high load on the database  then an outright lie that ghost training was a bug  many times disproven including with a screen shot of wranglers own forum post advising players of this feature i mean bug and finally they grudgingly semiadmitted that they just want the moneywe were lied to we were treated like idiots and told it was for our own good we were lied to again dishonesty and disrespect are the issues herefrankly this affair has destroyed what little faith i had left that ccp have a long term interest in eve my characters represent a very considerable investment for me and now im wondering if i should realise that investment while its still worth anything
and this crap comes in just as im about to start lv5 bs which takes 37 fricken daysthey take years to sort somthing out for jita then they take a few days to think hmm i could make more money out of people who cant be arsed waiting for a skill that takes over a month to doany think that improves the game they take ages to do things that make it worse takes a weekcnts
against the change
well im not happy with this change but it was rather predictable island gone bankrupt and ccp is going to leech money from customers in every possible way
canceling my 5 accounts as soon as they open the account management section back up
supporting this despite the fact that ccp wont change their mindsim actually pretty disgusted that ccp tried to palm this off as a bug fix

this sets a dangerous precedent whats next on inactive accounts rp market orders contracts research slots manufacturing slotswill npc slots be forever taken if someone lapses an account will they lose that slot and the result if they happen to miss a days payment will their orders no longer be visible and operatingi can just about cope with the ghost training change but it really does send the wrong messageedit oh and i agree with what malcanis wrote since i wrote my equivalent in the main feedback blog thread i wont repeat it here
can i have your stuff
hell this is great i see a great potential of coughmoronscough leaveing the population of eve onlinemeans bigger fightsless lagraises glass of wine cheers
make me a favor a drive a nail through your ear n00b
sorry havent had my tetanus sp shotbesides i ran out when i couldnt drown out the whining  o p
skill training on a lapsed account really isnt that much of an issue it brought people back to this game and so what if people used it to train alts you had to sub that alt for 30 days at a time in order to set the next skill this was more money in ccps pocket a large number of v skills finish before 30 days so you usually would have an alt account 30 days on 20ish days off unless you were training a rank 8 skill to v i always thought training skills was to be detached from actually playing the game a person ghost training a skill isnt logged in with that character and isnt playing the game or effecting the game world with that character the end result of this will be a huge drop in subscriptions for ccp people will not find it worth it to keep alt accounts going and will just transfer their alts to their main accounts and forget training all together after they get the alt built what they should do instead is prevent rp gains while on an inactive account and introduce a skill queue that only works on active accounts these 2 things would fix a needed advantage and would add to the game in a way most players want and would find very convienenti was up until recently considering getting an alt account so i can train up some useful alts now it seems like a worthless idea and would just cost too much extra money for a character i will not be playing that often
ccp should just get rid of trial accounts as a paying account holder i object to other people playing for free this is an exploit i know they advertised this trial as a feature for a long time plz fix asap
tt
thinking of doing just that atmhave 3 accounts might transfer to 1 account taking the main off each account
i say let the skill thats currently being trained complete if theres more in the queue it stops training this gives added peace of mind for subscribers and less peace of mind for people that want to take advantage of this im still against the proposed ghost training nerf
new sound effects would be an awesome addition
i am completely against this change and i almost never fly nano it is easy enough to counter and harder to do than than the carebears would think this change would also make it impossible to bump ships out of the docking radius of a station leading to ungodly amount of dockingundocking station games
against this crap
im against the nano nerf
yes way stop this nerf
againstyeah no i dont think this a good idea at all
i am against the nanno nerf its not hard to kill a nanovagaor ishtar there are ships and tatics for that if ya cant handle that go back to carebear land if your gonna be in 00 grow some and stop cryingand o yea time to pay for your training muhahahahah
im against the nano nerf cusummmmm i live in fountain which is conveniently placed for snake droppage and autumn walks so long live the nano 
can his go on the front burner now that everyone has to shut up about ghost training
now that ghost training is gone this makes even more sense because now people cant abuse it pick 3 30 day skills and train them all for freesigned
if you need to seduce players to log into your game by having a userunfriendly skill training mechanic i would say you dont have a lot of confidence in the fun of your gameplay personally ive not seen or spoken to anyone that logs into the game to change a skill and then magically changes his mind and stays to playive seen plenty of people log on to the game to play after a skill is finished recently so they can enjoy its benefits if you come home knowing that you can finally fly assault frigates and can take out your lovely retri for a spin that will motivate people to log in more usually i simply choose to lose skill training spending 5 minutes to start up eve login navigate to skill and switch training and then logging out again feels like an idiotic chore also to have corp mates pop on say hi and seconds later log off is a common occurence skill change visits i dont think this enhances gameplay in any wayi dont see any need for limitations especially now that you cant train skills while not paying only difficulties i would see are technical in nature
give damn facking queue 
now that you are getting rid of ghost training why cant you give us a bone and let us have skillqueues we log in to play a game not to micromanage skillswappingand i already klicked support box earlier
i would change to wow just to spite ccp but wow is evil i tell yaany how as you have taken away ghost training like 10 days b4 i need to do bs lv5 you s alteast give us a proper skill queue so people dont have to log on a stupid times of the day to changeand no that will not make people play less it just lets them get more sleepand dont worry ccp you s you will still get our money for doing bugger all for us
might as well do this since if an account doesnt train while unsubbed theres not much of a reason to keep an alt around
this makes dollars so it also makes sense
hrm just remove inactive chars from eve altogetherits like they never existed iiam
support
these are arguably worse than ghost training in that they generate isk the real bread and butter of eve without any subscription or effort id elaborate but i already wrote a bunch of words about it in like three different threads so whatev
you have my axe erm i meansupportwhy let people make isk without paying for it if they cant train skills without paying for it
constancy is good
 its consistency
supported
lets run this  into the ground
while i dont like this decision ccps method of informing us or the short noticei have to agree if theyre going to do it they shouldnt half it
in the name of consistently ing up the game sure why not
signed
if ghost training is removed all of this must all go into effect on inactive accounts as that would seem to be the most fair of things
this just sounds like a bunch of suicidal fans that want to make sure to nail in the final nails in eves coffini agree strip all the features out of an unsubscribed account lets get this bandaid ripped off fast and let the hemmhoraging of ccps cashflow begin
hell must be cold tonight because i am supporting a goon
this is a good idea all of these poor capsuleers who are being cheated by ghost training surely must hate inactive accounts existing in any aspect of the game under ccps insectoid logic we must remove all inactive accounts from any aspect of the game because waaah it isnt fair lets be honest ccp dont take us for fools no one is whining about people ghost training this is about you getting your hands on every penny you can pinch i almost think the announcement of the ghost training removal wouldnt be so bad if you would have just admitted from the get go that this maneuver is about making the money required for you to maintain the server not about capsuleers putting energy into the game as for ghost training being unintendedskills continue training even if you are logged off or if your account is inactive in the second scenario you cant change skill training though as a result it is a good idea to train short skills while you are playing and longer ones when you log off if you want to switch skills you can simply do so by starting another skill training the points gained on the previous skill will not be lost but you dont benefit from the training until the level is fully completed the highest level for any skill is level 5 but some skills also have an advanced version some of those advanced skills influence the same area as the basic version others only a related areaso in the spirit of shafting your player base by all means lets run this game into the ground so that maybe the capsuleers wont put any energy or money into this game
supporting this let ccp put its feet into a meat grinderhopefully lag and disconnects will disappear when the rp dont get accumulated once a day endsarcasmalso i suggest that ccp should immediately delete an account all characters on it and stuff as soon as the account becomes inactive
eve is getting a little stale i think ill let some accounts lapse so i can pay for more hookers and beer 3 months down the road i start feeling a little twitchy and am thinking about maybe relapsing and hitting the ol spacecrackpipe again my incentives to come back includegallente carrier v completednice pile of accumulated passive incomenot coming back at all and going outside if youre gonna screw it up at least be consistent about it supported
i dont like this i cant use my card here my bank is blocking all international charges so i buy gtc with paypal but other then that i like this
totally agree no matter who much hard earned cash people spent creating and using accounts on eve the moment they stop paying they are worthless scum who are freeloading off the system and everyone else and should have everything they were told they could have in the game taken away and i dont think more then one days notice would sound unreasonable to me
if ccp really have to do this then i agree they should completely disable anything that could advantage a disabled account
its possible to have an inactive account for a year or more come back and drop a huge load of datacores on the market enough to seriously mess with the market for that core for weeksthats vastly more disruptive than anything ghost training doeswhich is basically nothing
i have no experience in rd but i do have knowledge of contracts and buysell orders and i think if somethings worth doing its worth doing righteyes on the ethermy vote character must not be able to profit at all if the account the player is part of is not actively subscribed could mark the sellbuy orders in the db as not to be listed on the market almost as simple as that
if ccp are going to screw us over they might as well screw us over royally and do it right momma always said it aint worth trying if youre not gonna do it right
why go half hog with a stupid idea when you can run with it
momma always said like was like a box of chocolate you never know when youre gonna get punt kicked in the buttor something like that
stop lp  yeacorp closure  market cancel  naydeleting very old characters specially on trial accounts and corporations without any members  yea
agreedimho banning goast tranin is a positive step so they should go one step further and nerf account processes in general
supporting goon trolls
goons are being sarcatic trolls per usual but i agree with killing rp and market orders if possible would be consistent with ghost skilling the difference between market ordersrp and sp is that you cannot just pause a market order or pause your rp you can cancel market ordersrp but that is different from pausing as you lose all current rp if ccp wrote a way to pause all ordersrp and other stuff then i fully support thisnot being able to reactivate an account with gtcs makes zero sense however you not are profiting with an inactive account so that doesnt make any sense at allweak troll 510
yes to a stop on rp gain for inactive accounts so that the legitimate players can earn more with themon the other hand it makes invention more expensive and thats not a good development but that system should be overhauled anyway
all is good up untilgtcs are cold hard cash some of us cant subscribe through ccp shop i forget the error or whatever i got when i tried but it wouldnt worktrading isk for gtc codes securely just makes sense
did not read op
absolutely ive been calling for this for months
ghost research points should be removedother changes are not needed
i hate you all
if ccp are removing ghost training then i see no reason for them not to do this too
yes
im going to say no on the basis that im against the disabling of ghost training anyway as a bad precedent that caused all this crap promoted by a bunch of whiners who seem to want every mmo out there to be absolutely the samewhy not go the whole way and just have us earn sp on blowing ships up and therefore no sp earning unless youre playing the game which should sound familiar territory to those from other mmos and forget about all the things that made eve the game it was
supported if only because this will make me loads of isk
only right to halt all functions on an inactive account while it is inactive

yep
yep yep
very much agree
i can hear the screaming on the forums now my bank screwed up my direct debitsand you deleted my accountswheres my dreadnoughtfreighterbattleshipetcetcetc
op is nothing but logical and consistent end rpmarketresearch exploitation by unsubbed alts now
10
supported
consistency
id agree with it without the nongtc option simply because with multiple accounts its easy and frequent enough that an account goes inactive because you werent watching the days remaining on the account transferring isk to the inactive account from an active one should still be possible
i love this idea
supported
im all for consistency
this needs implemented if ghosting is an imbalance then getting rp and thus isk while inactive should be blocked too and right away
accounts should be frozen for six months then deleted to allow for minor misshaps to be avoidedie people in hospitals the forces etc
this is an issue extremely important to the success of eve
i agree with all points but reactivation using real currencygtcs are purchased using real currency and whether the holder of the gtc decides to use an in game mechanic in order to exchange it for isk with another player should not be a factor ccp still profits from the sale as they would a normal transaction
yeah if youre no longer able to accumulate skill points on an unsubbed account theres really no reason why you should be permitted to acquire research points or sell items through the marketcontracts eitherending this inconsistency would also mean less easy isk entering the game and distorting the market
i find the whole idea of inactive accounts accruing rps unfair support suppension of rp gatheringall market buy and sell orders
yes
seems reasonable

since these forums have something to do with the game i assume i can still raise this issueid like the forum mods to be a lot more heavy handed on the forumsobvious trolls spamming childish catchphrases ibtl first etc these things should incur a warning with a second infraction resulting in a temp ban if it was my choice you wouldnt even get the warning thankfully the signed spam was stopped but its time to take out the rest of the trashout of all the forums ive read this would have to be the one with the worst signal to noise ratioyou dont need an account to read the forums and dare i say if id browsed the forums before signing up to play eve i wouldve thought twice before subscribing this game has an awesome community unfortunately the forums dont reflect this at alljust a quick glance at the front page of general discussion at the moment shows about 10 threads having been locked for spammingbeing useless threads the people posting these should be warnedtemp banned so that those serious about this gamecommunity dont have to wade through that sort of thingso basically im advocating for stricter rules on the forums to hopefully increase the quality of posting
first
iirc the forums and their moderation were determined to be out of scope for the csm that didnt stop us trying to get a change but basically its a soontm
this does seem kind of cool would butcher my pvp but would also be epic definately would require full scale testing on sisi though
you do not know that ghost rp are not going to be removed changes that will dramatically affect the value of ingame items datacores in this case are never announced prepatchyes i have been buying datacores today starting a good rumour means i win even if i am wrong
reduce training times by 50 ive been playing eve for awhile now and have two accounts presently on one alt i am looking at training frigates cruisers battle cruisers  battleships to lvl 5 this will take 3 months to train with my learning skills of 44 this time makes me think should i bother should i do train something else or should i quitnow with the ghost training nerf im finding that paying continuously to achieve these skills is just not worth the money spent to achieve lvl5 skillsmy proposal is to reduce all training times by 50 so training doesnt make you quit eve with what i call training boredom and to placate all the paying long term pilots they are given 50 of the skill points they have at the time of implantation to use on which ever skills they choose
been there done that youll make it through if you want to be perfect in something it takes time my advice is to widen your abilities and go for flexibility instead of ultraspecialization and get the learning skills to 5 on the tier 1 skills
i see no reason to decrease the training timesafter all you can always play the game while youre waiting for that skill to reach v
by decreasing training times you suddenly have a major problem on your handsnoobs show up with battleships and larger vessels and traffic gets to be a major problemmight wana think before you post
this is a random solution that doesnt address the issue youre really concerned about  removal of ghost training if removal of ghost training is the issue itll get a better result by discussing in those threads on how to improve it
remove implants so that skills take longer to train
yea

a concept i can get behind
lots of thumbs up from goons to a goon idea so you know this is a horrible ideathumbs down 
supported one catch though im tired of bringing down a towers shields and not being to unanchor the  if i somehow stumble across one of this pirate hideoutsfobs i want to be able to bookmark it grab a hauler and pull this sucker to a station hack it and loot whatevers inside
stupid reason not to vote for something that is actually a cool idea
excellent idea gets my support
this idea is awesome
if they put npc controled cyno points in 05 systems only it would allow jumps back to hi sec but would prevent hi sec to hi sec jumpscorp standings would be taken into account of course
if a cyno can be fired in highsec there is no logic by existing game rules that any capital ship be able to lock onto the signal and jumpinadditionally as mentioned in previous posts it would make eve a small place with little meaning in market differentiation
why can black ops jump in and outsauce for the goose is also sauce for the gander lets have consistancy at least
agreed on that maybe the issue is because jump freighters are not covertshipspilot a hey  im sure i just saw a ship the size of a small moon  where did it gopilot b it cloakedpilot a yeah right
somewhere in the middle is eve online and the people who play it allowing ships to cyno into high sec is silly cyno into lowsec and use a gate just like a normal freighter
fine with me same for black ops then 
fine with me same for black ops then blackops serves a different purpose so im not sure the two should be compared but im happy to see the merits discussed in a separate thread
there is a trend now for pirates to join a militia faction as either a sister corp to a pirate organization or as individuals in any case they show blue to their targets and are killing their fellow militia members there doesnt seem to be any mechanics other than word of mouth to stop this militia fw need a voice and some control over these individuals recommend that csm look into having players have some say on corps and individuals something along the lines of a misconduct board with the ability to discharge from the fw individuals that are not in the spirit of the game
no quit ing asking ccp to hold your ing hand and do something about it yourselves if its such a big deal
this is a fw question and not meant for fountain trolls ps i heard bob is comming to take fountain from you when they do try joining an opposing faction to minmatar you make excellent cannon fodder
we keep hearing people tell us this theyve been coming for the past 5 months i sure hope theyd hurry up and get it over withalso it is the hallmark of a great idea when you have no basis to back it up with and have to devolve to ad hominem attacks
dont know what your talking about got 3 blues today with a pirate corp killing militia in amamake its not a solo trick there is no way to eject these people from militia as you can in any other corp or alliance as for attacking you you really should read what you posted my post is not a whine there needs to be a mechanism in place to build a foundation even a npc one
im not really sure you understand how pl operates if you think for a second that we wouldnt enjoy the hell out of bob invading
i fail to see the problem whether they are in militia or not theyre going to kill you
shoot them when they go flashy in lowsec  if you are in a militia npc entity wardec them and fight back  if you are in a fw aligned corpuse the systems in place to organize and gain revenge for these slights this is not any kind of issue that csm or ccp need to address
they lose a load of standing if they do that right and will be booted from the militia quite soon at least that was the idea could you look up how big a standing hit these guys are getting
well i think a solution would be to allow megacorporationsconglomerates can claim 00 for a factionthis would mean that player groups could choose to work to expand their chosen empires borders cva might decide they want to remain separate from the empire and so not chose that path but a megacorporation might join a faction and work to claim sov for that faction as well so when megacorp uk decides to try and take parts of providence from cva it might actively claim those systems for the republicbut maybe i am off my rocker
no if you want to join then quit your allianceccp allowing alliances to join fw would severly mess up fw severly no alliance should be allowed to join fw
were had the 2nd formal meeting with ccp over the last couple of weekends and while i cant say anything officially as yet on the precise minutes waiting formating and approval lets just say things are looking pretty good for this proposal its been a bit of a fight and lots of antifeeling from a tiny but vocal minority inside fw but ultimately i think everyone sensible realizes that you just cant have bits of eve content roped off from the rest of the game and inaccessible to the very players who are likely to enjoy it most and bring a lot to the tableit was always an aberration that rp alliances like ushrakhan and the cva were barred from fw  i very much hope and expect to see this resolved in the near future
i think this could be a good thing it could add a bit of structure to the fw militias that have had problems with leadership
while i like the rp flavour im not sure how you would handle the specifics wouldnt this still be giving the sov holding entity the benefits of 00 holdings if so is there a reason why players would choose not do this i had three teeth taken out this morning so maybe im not grasping something yet you are not giving any reason why alliances would be a bad thing what impact does letting an alliance in that a large and wealthy corp does not already havenot all alliances hold 00 space own highend moons or even can field large fleets those that do have little to no interest in fw anyway
ok i can support this ideaonly question is will this work the same way as drone regionsie accesible only by exploration
i honestly dont know how those drone regions work i was under the impression that the faction drone bpcs drop from exploration though the rats in asteroid belts are also rogue drones
here is an idea that i hope will add some neat content for mission runners and also perhaps devilishly please our pirates why not introduce escalating missions that during each step will bring mission runners deeper into low sec while at the same time deliver escalating rewardsnow these would be optional missions with a disclaimer that refusing the mission would not cause loss of standings however once it is accepted then if a player decides to cancel mission would cause a loss of standing
this would not push highsec players into lowsecit would just fill the wallet and toolboxes of lowsec playersbad trade eventually highsec players would only be more deterred from going lowsecalso the depth of lowsec is totally meaningless the lowsec systems closest to highsec are usually the most dangerous and most camped this would just increase and make things worse
low sec wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt so greatly gate camped and piratedbut it is and no one will find a solution to that because chaos is vastly encouraged
actually there is a rather simple solution that would even underline what lowsec really is instead of making it a 00 mirrorinstead of full fleet and concord presence in highsec and practically none in lowsec ccp could just have empire fleet groups randomly roam and patrol the lowsec systems the higher the security rating the more likely meeting a patrol until in 01 it will rarely ever happen more chaos even less predictable yet less pirate friendly theyd actually have to evade the law instead of just not having to worry about it that is not the topic here though
i see your pointwell back to the drawing board lol
roaming patrols of even concord and empire at random intervals would be intriguingyou should post an idea on thatit would discourage intense gate camping raise on high sec bordersand anything nearer to 1 space would be overlooked as it borders on 00 spacei like thisill be keeping an eye out for thatit kinda makes a nice transition from high sec being safer and low sec being less safer as opposed the literally taking a deep dive into the unknown
as many of you know by now on wednesday oct 15th ccp will put out a server update disabling ghost training ghost training was an unintended feature where unpaid accounts of eve online were able to continue training skills while this allowed players to run multiple characters on a shoestring budget in all effect this was a bugit should be noted that were not changing offline skill training for active subscribers in any way this change only affects those who do not have an active subscriptiondoes that mean that ccp is a greedy money chewing monster that just loves nerfing things of course not were a company like everyone else we make a game that we happen to love making and for most of us is the passion of our lives but its also a company we make a product sell it get salaries and then continue maintaining the product and making it betternow im not saying that if me personally would be at the other end of this dev blog i wouldnt be annoyed by ccps actions we are gamers we game the system we figure out how to maximize our returns theres no surprise that people have done this for the simple fact that it wasnt banned per se and also for the fact that it was possible but recently we have seen a surge in this behavior in a way that we were essentially supporting and maintaining a large number of customers that werent paying us regular subscriptions thats not fair towards ccp as a service provider and its not fair towards other players that pay a subscription but dont make use of this bugnow a single customer that doesnt log into the servers may not weigh heavily on our database infrastructure just as a single snowflake isnt that heavy hardly a measurable quantity but its hard not to notice an avalanche if it hits you and thats what was starting to happen in our databasewe can look at this from a variety of angles but it all comes down to 1 there was a way to progress a character in eve without an active subscription 2 ccp noticed a surge in the trend and decided to fix the leak 3 players now have to pay a subscription for characters to have them progresswe truly hope that the community will understand our actions and continue to enjoy playing eve as much as we enjoy making ittorfi frans olafssonsenior producer of eve onlineyea you are money grubbing thievesi have had up to 8 accounts feeding you cash and as the economy died so did my spending cash so i have already had to thin it out you say this is unfair to people who work their chars i still use and grind all of my accounts and to save money i let them expire to finish skills to save a few of my bucks you rotten ingrates guarantee that all people with active accounts dont just log on to train and never undock i will say ok until then keep looking for more reasons to charge more and come up with flimsy reasons that are ed at best i have 3 active accounts active at all times and you want more you are finding new and improved ways to rip people off and jacked up time periods for gtcs there is no question you are after the money nothing more
i really wonder how many total threads were created due to this  unpleasantness seriously i dont think this is something that the eve community will get over and i really dont think that ccp has seen the last of this wait until others come back to find their accounts still not skilled up in a month way to go ccp for killing their accounts seriously if i had inactive accounts and i came back i wouldnt play your game just out of spite and in fact id trash you to all the blog sites  which in fact is being done now good luck with all of that
i have the solutionas per the laws and regulations of the us any and all false advertisements are subject to fines imprisonment and or lawsuit you come after my wallet i come after yours this is not a threat it is a promise a foreign country based corporation selling their product in this country does fall under this topic
normally i would fight against this but ccp is starting to risk its very survival this game relies on hardcore players hardcore players often times are smart and will not take much  ccp is risking its survival by raising gtcs and caning ghost training i say this because they were 2 things that have been stable throughout the game and have helped make eve what it is ccp is currently upgrading server hardware this means there will be loads of old hardware either rerouted to other portions of the game or tossed take 1 one of those old opteron blades and code it to be the ghost training server voila nothing lost from the eve cluster that isnt of less then negligable value that will be paid for by the every other payments from those ghost trainers money in the door is still money in the door and ghost trainers are using up way less resources then everyone else and you manage to turn a profit from the average player so youll be making a profit from ghost trainers as well as for gtcs you blabbed about how it was a money choice you guys made money selling them at 1495 per month now youve raised them to 3495 for 2 months thats an extra 5 not much right wrong many eve players are not financially well of even more have families and still more have wives that wont tollerate a nearly 20 a month us game money in the door is still money in the door be patient like all the players who train lvl 5 skills training corporate titan is a rank 55 lvl 5 skill every time you chase a player out of eve youre losing money and gaining nothing but a bad rep dont become the next blizzard you will regret it ccp you will regret it and die as the hardcore players the backbone of eve leave ruining your game foreveri support ccp learning from its mistakes the carrier nerf was a bad idea so you looked elsewhere making gtcs cost more and killing ghost training is a bad idea look elsewhere we know you can do it
greedccp you should be ashamed of yourselfi have been playing for about 6 months nowand this will probably be enough for me to tell you to stick your gamei play everyday  for hours on endgrinding my character through what is at most times a grindand according to you my newly started alt doesnt deserve to train 5 days of skill training off account while i play and grind my original character everydayi think your greed may have just overtaken your respect for the people who support your game day in and day outtheres many ways you could have handled your situation with people training extra long skills in ghost modewhy not limit the days to 30 why not do lots of thingsand dont try to tell me its not just about moneycause you certaintly dont care what happens to minei hope you get your moneybecause you may need it with the accounts you might just loseshame on youyours sincerly hacked offhuntedmaster and my now ripped of alt regoroth
ccp will do what they want and will always apply what they deem as important to them whatever is voted for or not will only ever get approval if they want it toas a gm said to me once its our game we can do what we want end of the daysame can be said for players in a way  only interested in themselves and what directly affects them and nothing else so whats the point in raising a topic with this issue none unfortunately
alrightlets play with an analogy a bitccp runs a lemonade stand they make eve lemonade i like their lemonade its sour and bitter but still more refreshing than the other guys lemonade the next day i see ccp ing into the lemonade jar and when confronted about it they tell you its our lemonade we can do what we want end of the day i then take my money and either buy the other guys lemonade or go to the store and buy myself something elseits our game deal with it is no way to sell a game
i know that and i know the playerbase knows that but unfortunately ccp never will  either learn to accept it or dont ccps strengh in customer service will never return  ive accepted that now i just play the game so i can keep in contact with friends ive made and damn ccp
so if i do not pay my account my charicters stop training till i pay my accounti can live with that
its a bugfix live with it it doesnt take something away that you payed for it takes something away for which you did not pay how many other games keep feeding inactive accounts a lot of games dont even keep them for reactivation for long
then keep some of the accounts inactive whats the problemwhy do you think you should have some sort of right to have 8 accounts training skills with paying three subscriptionslol youre not being a customer when you dont pay for your accounts so you have 0 rights to anything what makes you think that youve got some rights while not paying a dime i guess threatning people with lawsuits because you cannot have free stuff is the us way
well as a us citizen i assure you not all of us are so damn petty i find it amazing that youre getting so insanely bent out of shape out of something so small youre exploiting the game and you complain when ccp removes said exploit lawl pathetic
what part of subscription service did you not getyou dont pay you dont get servicehow can you possibly hope to even sue or take legal action when the judge would laugh you out of the court over a freaking game you didnt want to pay for but still wish to play for nothingget a life sheeshps id say gb2wow but you have to pay for that too  o p
i think what people dont understand is that it gives eve a uniqueness that was not found in other games the military man the family man the very busy school student can pause the game and pick up without feeling like the eve world passed them by thats something other games cannot provide and i think thats why others are thinking of trying out other space games that are in the works  at least they dont nerf features that are actually useful to them ccp made this game something that for 5 years people saw as something that fit their lifestyle  it may not have been the best game out there but the skill training motivated them to mission run to pirate and to make the eveverse what it is today ccp in effect made it so that you pay for their bandwidth and overhead costs while you use them  not while you dont use them i think thats the biggest issue  people are busy and dont play eve when they dont have the time sure some people may take advantage of the system but it costs ccp nearly nothing to keep them on board and eventually those people pay out now with this setup i think a lot of people are refusing to submit to ccps demands i know im not going to be happy about it  and i dont even use this feature that feature is security for me it states if i get bored i can leave and when i come back i dont have to start where i left off people feel betrayed people see this as ccp being unloyal to them when theres a breech of loyalty people lose respect and loyalty for those who dont stay loyal i really do believe this change could very well kill eve online and if the majority of people leave eve theres no point for me being on eve either
same herepeople need to stop crying about the change and get the hell over it ccp is not going to change their mind just because of a bunch of whiners are telling them tolife goes on get over it
easy for you to say youre not the one whos only got 15 mill sp and can only use t2 small hybrids
thank you i was starting to think i was losing my my mind with all the whining
due to the extremely low survivabilty of the eas paper thin and thus at the top of the primary list in most pvp fights they should be allowed to use the covert jump bridge to give them more of role in combat and give the black ops a much needed boost
theyre frigatesfrigates are no meant to be survivable theyre cheap ships that fill a niche if you want more survivability train into recons
yeah i agree but this isnt about adding survivability really its about making them more effective at being portalled into enemy space and making them more mobile supported 
for now with the fuel issues as they are this would give black ops a slightly greater punch since all of the other ships that can go through the tunnels are paper thin sbs and recons can both benefit from the cover of easswith this addition the handful of paper thin ships that can go through the portal would have more bite and since eass are light they can be sent through like sbs en masseitd make a decent team eas can incapacitate responders or defenders while sbs etc do their thing fly 15 or so through the portal and bring the hurt onto lonely ratters and minersgoes without mentioning that bops with their crappy scan res could use eas wingmen to increase their survivability again the light mass of eas and sb support hulls could allow a bops even with current fuel situation to pop in and back out with a covops or recon in local as the only warning
me thumbs up
this will make things a lot more fun edit support is lol
why does everyone want to make it a friggin t2 shipon second thought just give me whatever ships rats can fly that drops a 20m trit load and can loot
i believe that ccp should set a date and give notice well in advance when making significant changes such as the removal of ghost training and the nanonerfexample one ghost trainingon monday 13th october ccp announce theyre removing ghost training on wednesday 15th october this is pretty horrible for anyone whos gameplan involves taking advantage of ghost training especially if theyre in the middle of a long skill a much more palatable decision would have been to announce on the 13th that ghost training would end in say 3 months time or possibly at the end of the year that would lessen the nasty shock factor and give the players a little room to adjust and replanexample two the nanonerfwhilst weve known that this is going to happen in some form or other for quite a while no date has been fixed this is rather unfair on anybody who wishes to play with nanotactics in the meanwhile theres no way of telling how good an investment polycarbing a ship or buying a snake set is when it could be when they could be snatched away from you at a few days notice again setting a date for the nerf would make this a lot fairer say three months after the changes are decided and finalised
 ye
yea the ghost training thing kind of screwed over people who had taken advantage of the power of two offer it seems hard to imagine that ccp didnt know they were considering nerfing ghost training before the power of two offer so it would have been nice for those people to have had some forewarning
im not sure what more to add on the overview there should be a little icon next to every roid just like the icons that tell you who is warp scrambling you etc this icon will serve to show you if a roid is already being mined by somebody else that is its only purpose maybe it could even tell you who exactly is mining it in the tool tip when you mouse over it the icon could also be multicolored white for neutral green for corp members and purple for fleet membersthis helps in just that situation that you mentioned when you have a ton of people mining the same belt so they arent mining over each other mining the same roid is counter productive because if 2 people are mining the same roid and one person kills it before the other one whoevers mining lasers finish first gets all the ore and the other person doesnt get anything at present the only way to counter this is to carefully select roids in space that dont have a laser on them which is tedious and also can throw you out of alignment if youre clicking on a roid too fast and start to move toward it instead of selecting it or to just randomly pick roids on the overview and hope you dont overlap other peoplethis is an easy solution to the problem and a sure fire way to keep people from mining the same roid
could you not just move to another belti dont think this would be worth the programming effort given other priorities
you can already uses tags can you not
well i had a crazy ideamuch as we have escalating exploration sites why not have optional escalating missions that will lure players deeper into low seci say optional as in if player refuses they dont lose standingsanyway cheers on the rest
i made a clarification
eon is made by a separate publisher mmmpublishing under license so its totally outside the realm of influence of the csm
the the problem that needs to be fixed is there is no way to repair a disfunctional councilmembers that cannot work together in a civilized way to identify analyze and promote the issues effecting eve players i would define a disfunctional councilmembers as those that spend the majority of their time having noneve related arguments about their respective characters to the point of abuseforum bans are an indicator of this problem there are many others seen at the start of the first csm where a lot of that energy could be directed to helping eve and had no actual benefit to the purpose of the csm whatsoeverin regards to not everything has to have a benefit to the purpose of the csm the csm are only human argument belittles the humans who are capable of getting down to business are they subhuman i dont think so i think theyre fit for purposeunfortunately the nature of internet space games and lack of realworld or realconsequences for being unsuitable for position of responsibility mean that there is no existing please someone think of one way for vetting player appropriately with an electionin rl there are multipleelections before making it to the top but in eves election system this isnt currently the case which gives a high risk for people poorly suited to the job imhoedit thought of a potential subfilter  if the forums actually had the rate this post system and you could chose to filter out lowrated posts then there would be less voice for csm candidates who really werent fit for purpose
forum bans have nothing to do with the above problem forum bans are merely an indicator of the moderators judgement at any point in time they are mutually exclusive to the council and have no bearing on a council members effectivenessif youre looking for a measuring stick for council members id posit one already exists with the checks of a 6 month term ccps ability to remove council members and the councils desire to function internally against people if they so desire every time its come up its been shot down either administratively by the target or by the council when the target decided to feign good behaviornothing in this proposal solves the problem that youve outlined above this proposal merely gives the council a mechanism to alter the election results based on the judgement of the csmproof moderation teamultimately like it or not its the people voting who decide the councils standards not some silly elite class of people with their noses in the air this is by design and as it should be its called democracy your personal standards for behavior dont matter a bit when contrasted with the votersedit to answer your edit i welcome a post rating system we have one on gfcom and it works wonderfully
as long as youre just assigning shares totaling 100 to each of your characters on the account this seems perfectly fine to me its not exploitable given the demise of ghost training and its just an easy way of saving clicks when you want to train multiple characters on an account
ok i see you understand what i am saying you just said it all in one sentence
why would they all have to add up to 100 instead of all training full speedi dont go for this for the same reasoning that ccp is killing unsubbed training unsubbed acct  no trainingsubbed acct  training for all characters im paying for
what about if there was a slight penalty for training on multiple accounts say a 5 total for training 2 accounts and 10 total for training 3 accounts at the same time that is so if youre training 2 accounts one would be at 75 the other at 20 etc same with 3 main is at 50 the 2 alts are at 20 each if you only train 1 account you get the full 100 but if you want the ease and convenience of training multiple accounts at the same time you can do it but there is a penalty
you do not have to answer this just want you to think about it do you currently have 3 toons on the same account that you actually use or do you have a main and maybe a toon that you just pop onto once a month or less where you might delete it and make a new toonif you could train 3 chars all at full speed at the same time everyone would have 3 character just because they could train 3 chars at full speed at the same timewhat i am proposing is not much different than now its still 100 total for the account which is what we all pay for its just that i do not have to completely stop training on any char for a few hrs while i train something new on a toon
this method would penalize people for playing alts alts are already near uselessyou mentioned convenience of training multiple accounts at the same time the difference in my idea and the current way we are forced to train alts is that i can decide from the char select screen if i want one char to get 100 or two chars to get 50 each and so on and so forthi am suggesting neither a penalty nor an advantage for playing altsi have played many games and eve is the one where you often say why should i play an alt when my main has to completely stop training i understand the present process because of how offline training works where in other games you can only train when you online regardless if it is a main or a tooni am just asking that since i do pay for an account more than one actually that allows training while offline let me determine how that same rate of skill gain is dispersed to my toons if it is too confusing for anyone they can leave the slider set to the default 100 to only one character at a time
global criminal countdowns are too long its too much of a paint to deal with on lowsec roams they should be reduced to 5 minutes to help encourage piracy
awesome idea it is really a pain roaming with gcc
i concur
concur
i agree it is a pain but im pretty sure thats the point cripple the big bad ebil piates im a pirate just make more ss if anything the gcc should be used as a tactical limit makes everyone into better bait
increase to 30 minutes honestly how lazy are these concord fellows if they give up after 15 minuteson a side noteglobal criminal countdown is silly no where in eve is there a global as in globe criminaluniversal doesnt seem to work neither though maybe could be universally recognized as a criminal
indeed
hell no profanity needed to express hatred of idea this is a horrible idea the skills are ballanced and fair and in all honesty i like the fact that most noobs  and moan and leave because of the learning skills eve is and always has been a place for determined patient players by removing the learning skills you would undermine the basis for eves strong footing as the biggest virtually and baddest mmo on the planet thats like making it so you cant kill players who are on trial it defeats the damned purpose dont edit the skills system ever looks for negative support button
opps wrong button
to phrase it differently i think all varieties of intelgathering in this game need an overhaul and it has to be done all at once instead of piecemeal local chat is a terrible terrible source of intel but it has taken on great importance because theres really nothing better local needs to go but it needs to be replaced by a real method of gathering intel  the directional scanner and scan probes are great but theyre nowhere near enough for a full intel scheme if we were to view this suggestion as an addition to the current system i dont think i could support it  its too much when added to what exists asis if viewed as part of the aforementioned overhaul it sounds like a reasonable system more so now that youve clarified what you mean ill give it a thumbsup but its conditional on it being one part of a broader package of changes
congratulations about your carebear abilities 6 months mining veldsparwowthats the last thing i would do in this game but dudeif you had balls for mining 6 months in a row without shooting at yourself apart the other stuff you mentioned youre a ing winner
hyperbole and sarcasm of course i really have to wonder sometimes with all the mining barges in empire
qft
yeah pity bomb launcher range is 1520 km 
mob mentality  large groups of people with such massive amounts of influence by sheer numbers have the ability to effectaffect smaller groups of people via the threat or action of steam rollingsmaller guys cant fight against such things without a great deal of suffering and loss few survive even fewer remaineither they end up joining the mob serving it or leavingthats why i said you shouldnt say not bob as its a personal attack imhoyou could change that to not goon and it would still be the same messagebut what you are referring too is the classic gaming syndrome with larger communities the mob mentalityand since the super alliances that now exist number in the thousands its pretty easy to push people aroundfortunately the population of everyone else outnumbers them for nowim quite sure there are memberscorps in these larger alliances that are not as bad as there reputation tends to indicate at the risk of stereotyping of courseso dont typecast the super alliance or a super alliance give the impression your above prejudice and just indicating the tendencies that come with the territory of being that large
meh bob is probably flattered by the reference or maybe theyre screaming weve thinned down our numbers to only the very best and are now only about one thousand and thats mostly alts and after all weve accomplished this comparison is so unfair nande yanen should be banned 4everwhich i highly doubtback to more relevant things im still panning around ideas for integrating the whole planetary production chain with ccps ideas for reworked industry and my idea for space blingidea in short is to have meta items capable of being produced by smaller alliances with planetary resource income meta items require minerals and progressively more mineral formations or whatever from the planetary side for higher meta levels this way as an alliances production capabilities get more and more uber it ends up producing more and more luxurious goodsto isolate production from affecting empire i was thinking that each item could have 1 the name changed to reflect the producing alliance item is a dummy that references an existing meta item 2 a stat that requires user to have same alliance ticker in order to be able to useor something similarsame idea for the slightly better ship models harbinger mk i harbinger mk ii etc these should have slightly buffed stats and ever so slightly buffed fitting add an extra configuration slot that can be fed a special rig that cant be placed on other ships this is all ripped off the csmcpp thread and slightly worked on by me btw rig buffs the bonuses or maybe adds new bonuses etcresearch facility  manufacturing plant better names desiredrequires intermediate sov and a decent sized investment can be destroyed only if sov captured and can be captured instead produces bpcs based on some metric i havent decided yet these get used together with the planetary resources to produce meta space bling and slightly better t1 ships etcdevelopment institute  industrial complex better names desiredrequires capitol sov and a large investment same destruction rules produces higher level bpcs based on a similar undecided metric used with planetary resources for factionlevel space bling maybe crossfactionesque ships and definitely for implants has a hitormiss can you hq it invention feel and requires lots of planetary income per item but produces really uber stuff that is unique to the producing alliancethis provides a clear path to having the best shyt involving processes that use resources that are quite volatile at the initial production level but mostly useful at the i gots sov 4 level the intraalliance consumption system would guarantee empire producers wont have the stuff being dumped on their markets kinda draconian but also kinda cool interstellar alcohol conglomerate mega neutron blaster mkiv would be really awesome if these structures could be built with a modular design system such that one alliances prized assets are differentiated from other alliances assets paths for upgrade as wellhow does something like this sound
point the first is already working but does not achieve the intended goal pos are relatively cheap and you dont even need sov to put one on a dyspro moon requiring infrastructure in order to reap the benefits or to make those benefits useful entrenches the existing alliances it is just those benefitsmoney ability to build supercaps that keep 00 alliances so powerful compared to start upsany effort to increase the value of 00 needs to come exclusively in the form of the general noninfrastructure related activities 00 sov space needs to have much better asteroid fields and rats to encourage people to come and kill them and mine them new logistical structures that would be put in place need to have no tie to existing sovereignty mechanics their value to those who are taking effective ratting mining and missioning area is in the power they afford the people who are trying to control the space in the first place which makes them effective incentives to pvpas well on the other sidethe only reason that dyspro moons do not fulfill this requirement is that dyspro is a corporation wide endeavor this means that the individual pilots will unknowingly shy away from attacking and creating such infrastructure since they are unaware of the positive externalitiestheir corp having money externalizes benefits onto its members and even if they are aware may not act anyway as well the difficulty in taking down said resource is too effective a barrier to entry if we want more competition for 00 resourcescompromise point the second will not work it is impossible to remove blobbing by enforcing simultaneous combat multigrid solutions are possible but multigrid solutions still must resolve around a single contention point or fail in that one side can blob and win and the other has no such optionthe only way i can see that working is by letting dreadnoughts target stationary objects from off grid via a target painter and allow pos guns the same luxurywhile severely limiting their on grid effectiveness against smaller ships though this produces other problems compromise point 3 is futile while wealth is not a zero sum game player participation is a zero sum gamemore or less if you want more people to come to 00 they will need to come from somewhere this somewhere will be highsec since there are even fewer people in lowsec than nullsec empire is already where the majority of pvp good production is handledsince there is no risk of losing access to a t2 bpo in a station and there is ample supply of invention goods with lowsec handling the majority of nonsuper capital capital production
im aiming for something much more granular and straightforward say 25m to throw it up add water reap income subcap gang can knock it out in a day thats volatility that small alliances will benefit from as they can live under the radar and rapidly regain their territory if wiped kind of capture the flag but its only one part of a twopart compromiseexactly part two is to elevate stable alliances to an extent above the circus that will become resource production with fast turnover at the subcap level this is why i called this thing a compromise it benefits the large and the small and enriches their means of interactionraising income through ratting and mining just means more ratting and mining thats not a game to me skill training is automated for a reason im in favor of moving 00 income to a more passive system as well where your successes in pvp and war industry affect your ability to field passive income generatorswe already hit that pony until it was blue in the face check out fahtims thread theres even a qa by toman addressing your concerns easy to find in the second assembly thread i believepoint 3 exists because with all this passive income flying around some empire players might wonder if empire will just become a huge joke compared to the bling of 00 in a way thats what i hope happens but more in the sense of 00 being a different ballgame altogether
how long does it take to take 25m any effort to induce players to move enmasse into 00 cannot have an infrastructure component even mining has a problem they have large infrastructure componentslogisticsyou need to encourage people to go there and stay there for the duration then you need to encourage them to come back the barrier to entry needs to be more or less nil only the cost of the ships you are flying otherwise you are not going to create any significant pressure on 00 entities or there will not be a limited amount of resources to go around which means less pvp rather than more00 space is a zero sum game two entities do not coexist there is a limited amount of resources and as one side gobbles it up the other side necessarily loses if you are inducing small alliances to push into sovereign space then you are necessarily reducing the power of large alliancesthere is nothing wrong with reducing the power of large alliances but you cannot possibly do both at the same time they are mutually exclusive that is exactly what we have and its not working its not working because large alliances have huge efficiency gains as they grow when it comes to putting up taking down and protecting passive income generators they have to do less work per person than a small alliance has to in protecting limited resources link i recall reading it but i also recall it failing to properly address the problempoint 3 exists yes but its not compatible with the other stated goals these positions are mutually exclusive and any compromise is going to compromise on just how much participation you want to drain from empire and just how much power you want to remove from existing alliances any solution that fails to acknowledge that fact will fail because its goals will be impossible
assembly thread tomans version of the proposal with his qa included at the time 00 threads were the redheaded stepchild sextuplets of the assembly hall and nobody wanted to raise any more of them not sure about some of your points but keep working on it so at least the language of this compromise can be adjusted to get the message across clearlynobodys talking about increasing the player base in the game what is being talked about is 1 not making the game a joke for the 50 or so of players who never leave hisec who probably will to an extent if 00 is buffed 2 not making empire such a joke that anyone who cant leave immediately new players needs to quit the gamei understand what youre saying about the zerosum game but large alliances cant play whackamole across the entire galaxy every time someone trashes one of their production units and sets up shop the inevitable result of a high volatility asset is that those with the most consistent presence will dominate the activity regardless of the tides the flow over thembefore i answer about the 25m im envisioning that they make the equivalent wealth of 250m by the end of the week does that change the nature of your question is free a bad thing im all for free25m could be too large or too small in some eyes being taken down in a day reinforced mechanic but no stront by a handful of rr battleships may be seen as too fast or too slow by some without a doubt though it sits far below the pos level of volatility and will create the whackamole environment that large alliances will have to ignore at some point they can participate where it makes sense but will inevitably seek to consolidate their territories to what they can keep in easy reach for the volatile part of this compromise thats whats desiredon the high end with the production systems requiring various levels of sov and having capitol benefits etc stable alliances with the muscle to play on that field will have the upper hand while nobody is blocking small alliances from getting the proper sov and setting up their own systems the reality is that they will suffer from sov volatility at the hands of larger powers and have to resort to their advantages at the whackamole scalethe zerosum will be made more of a mutual relationship by the reality of supply and consumption capability of the new resources for instance subt2 meta level items can be produced by small alliances using mostly minerals and a little bit of the new mineral formations from planetary sources higher level meta and beyond can be produced by large alliances who can invent the bpcs at their facilities but these items require an  ton of the planetary resources result is that the large alliances are trying to offload minerals and the small alliances are trying to offload mineral formations thats a selfcontained economy that plays out entirely outside of empirein a nutshell there should be new assets for all some new assets will cater to large alliances some will cater to smaller alliances and corps or even individuals the mutual relationship via production and realities of the types of volatility that large and small alliances can handle will ultimately keep them in healthy symbiosesthat make more sense keep posting ill work on the language at some point
tomans version is ty and falls into all the same traps as every other decentralized solution he makes no mention of the obvious defensive strategies and one sides laghe assumes that one side will have problems because of lag and the other will not specifically that the small gang lags less than the big gang when the big gang comes to knock the small gangs  in the obvious defensive strategy since the attackers need their dreads on the field is t blob the freaking dreads while they cant shoot the planetthis obsoletes all the other fights until the main fight is over since one side cannot hope to win the cap fight when their subcaps are off spending 20 minutes killing the pdssand neither am i talking about increasing the player baselook assuming that the player base does not increase the number of players getting a use out of space will always total the number of players if we induce more people to leave highsec for 00 then highsec sufferssince its the proximity to markets and missions that gives the space its value anywaythere is no way around this if you make 00 better in order to draw people out you cannot keep highsec the same it will change new hubs will be createdno see that is exactly what they can do and its even easier for them to actively defend production with less people due to the way that systems are alignedhigh volatility is good its exactly what you need but that is not what you are proposing the barriers to entry reduce its volatility the logistics reduce its volatility this means of production needs to be solely based on the activities of players in short you want a resource that gives you money when you are there and doesnt at all period when you are not no reinforcement no 10 minutes of an rr battleship if the enemy shows up its production is toast until the enemy leaves a simple reseeding of belts in 00 to double or triple their size andor value as well as keeping their spawn rate constant would do this 250mweek is simply not enough to justify consistent presence and without consistent presence you are back to the large alliance problem they will dominate that game just as they dominate the pos gamei mean  how long did gs keep those dyspro moons in the north while fighting a full on pos war in geminate now while this isnt likely to happen on such a scale its going to happenthere is no such thing as an organic small alliance boost there are only boosts to established entities or upstart entities more coming
it makes sense its just intellectually bankrupt you cannot change the 00 sov mechanics without impacting the status quo you should not even be tryingthe question is instead what about the status quo is bad why is it bad how do you change itwell aside from specific balance points the complaints from the large alliances are threefold1 shooting pos is boring its boring because there arent any people around and there are a  tonne of pos to shoot2 lag3 small gangs have nothing to dothe complaints aside from specific balance points from the small alliances are fourfold1 shooting pos is boring2 lag3 small gangs have nothing to do4 holy  were going to get crushedyou can do something to fix number 1 and 2 and 3 number 4 is impossible but we will talk about that in a bit more depth laterfixing number one is easy reduce the number of structures that are necessary to destroy in order to flip sov from a game standpoint it doesnt matter what the structures are and where the structures are so long as they are limited and dont interfere with other mechanics of producing sov you can also make them easier to destroy easier to fuel etc etc etcmoons are actually a good place to put these structures stations already go on planets and we have a bunch of moons around to use stars are the other point but it might not be that a central sovereignty point is what people want to focus onhere is a way that you can reduce the number of pos simply and speedily and while it aint perfect its better than moving it to planetsalright so we reduce the number of pos and make their defenses weaker now we have to do something about laglag is the tough one because you are dealing with a central point of contention and in order to really effectively have a fight you need to have a central point of contention spreading them out creates blobs at one side or the otherone way of spreading the fight out would be to have one fight spread across two grids the fight is threefold 1 defending your grid 2 finding the enemies grid 3 attacking the enemies grid blobbing any one grid will leave you unable to damage the enemies important infrastructure if you cant damage the enemies important infrastructure they are just going to keep beating on you until you dieie lets take small cheap friendly ships give them a target painter s that only work on modules capitals and pos structures then we let any dread within 1au shoot the target of that target painter if one side doesnt go after the others dreads then its a race to kill the painters which will be carried to the front lines enmasse by carriers just as they now provide frigates before the enemies destroy a target and such the side that is not doing offense looses if both sides are doing only offense then at least we have two fleets in two areas we have successfully split the fight for a single pointthe pos into two pointsthe pos the enemy dreads and maybe even three pointsthe pos the aggressor dreads and the defender dreadspoint three is the hardest letting small gangs be good at sov warfare means that large gangs gangs will be even better such small gangs need to have efficiency gains built in some place there are a number of problems with this that mainly rely on the eve system architecture you see systems in eve are mainly arranged in pipes this means that a number of attacks on various structures doesnt gain much over a single force attacking one and then going down the linemore to be continued
a pos requires a capital attack and nobody wanted to invest in an assault on gs at the time especially when they likely had no capability to hold the assets or defend anything they put in place its that simple on the flip side if it were possible to cut the legs out from under gs with subcap gangs gs would have seen a much higher loss in domestic production on the home front hell thats where i would have been thats what i mean by high volatilityi went exploring all over gs and found the same things over and over a few people in a station system here a paladin hitting the station as soon as i hit local there nothing really to defend gss home front was not as exposed as you would think there was nothing to rally a subcap gang to go hit i faced greater risks from gatecamps set up by other alliances and corps at regional choke points in a high volatility environment those gatecamps would have been instead attacking gs assetsi hope highsec does recede a bit because of the exodus of players with the skills to get involved in the skirmishes over planetary income by isolating the source and sink of the added production to a 00 phenomenon empire wont turn into a slum for the players who start out therechoose to stay there the entire t2 production stream will still be in place and that leaves a lot of activity and opportunity for trade which is all that empire needs to preserve its place the missions are still there the mining is still there the lowrisk income for start ups is still there the lack of exposure to the 00 alliances via pvp is still there this is what i mean by preserving the place of empirenot seeing the advantage youre getting at while gs can wipe most alliances best fleets by getting their numbers together can they do it in every system where every upstart 00 tycoon chooses to attack them can they do it against every raid from every other neighboring alliance if the income lost to gs and gained by the raiders were large and required an expendable investment would an alliance like gs feel much more hurt at the level of this mechanism when they were away from home i believe the answer is yes and that gs leadership would opt to rein in their assets to what they found essential and what would net them a gain as far as the required presence to maintain the assetgs cant fly across the galaxy to meet every gang that rears its head sure they can win here and there and by great margins but can they do it everywhere at a minutes notice sure they can make a tour of an entire region and incap everyones income generators with minimal losses but can they hold anything like that i believe the answer is no and that alliances like gs will quickly realize that while the rewards are high the player load is simply too high to have to repeatedly make these attacks over and over againmaybe localized gs cells would be able to fight this mechanic to an extent but this splits up gss numbers and makes them progressively more vulnerable to any other alliances best fleets and this nullifies their initial advantage of sizesubcap vulnerable low hp and cheap would present the most challenging environment gss of 00 can ever face
the only way to make said attacks do thatand this is the only way to effect an organic way to make small gangs useful which is to make the efficiency gain in adding another ship to the existing fleet lower than that of having that ship go off and do something on its own which occurs mainly in the time cost of travel is to vastly reduce the ability of poss to defend strategic pos modulesbridges generators maybe jammers but probably not as an aside you would then git rid of fueling as well the idea that logistics would be getting the stuff up and protecting it since it was easy to destroy like a 510 man cruiser gang could do it easily in a few minutes give them the properties of a repping bs once the repair rate is sufficiently broken the gain in efficiency in killing the target becomes linear rather than exponentialrepair is unnecessary flat hit points could also work if you make the strategic pos module effect sufficiently time sensitivea broken jump bridge doesnt matter if its up when the enemy jumps trough easy to replace and easy to destroy then attacking them for the heck of it isnt very valuable but during a sov contest sending forces to destroy those structures that aid in the enemy bringing ships to the frontand then camping the pipes and ensuring that they stay down becomes a valid option as well as if course dedicating forces to ensuring that the structures stay operational then you have a balancing act regarding ensuring that you can reinforce the fight that your enemy cannot and the fight itself as always the sole determiner of the outcome of sovereignty has to be fight over the single point but you can extract efficiency gains by running interference on both sides if the structures that allow that to happen are sufficiently volatile 4 is something you just cannot fix though you can make it easier the reason you cannot fix 4 is because not only is more people  less people good for the gamesince it encourages newbees to participate in the fight and keeps the hegemony of the rich and old from turning the game into a ty wow clone but because more people always means advantages in a cooperative game the only way that you can reduce the strength of established alliances is to increase the number of small alliances and individuals when there are a small number of players the power of the large established block can easy cajole the others into working for their own endseg lets take a three person game where the winner is the one that wins a fight between the three relatively equal people there are no rules what is the optimal strategya form an alliance with either as quickly as possible then beat up the odd man out then after they are gone try beat up the other guy your chances of winning went from 13 to 12 sometimes people kinda kike the guy they teamed up with to beat up on the odd man out and they form a more lasting bond this is how corporations alliances and power blocks are formedagain remember no rules if you want to shake up 00 you will have to encourage the formation of new power blocks that means you have to give small individual entities a reason to go to 00 space and hope they dont ally themselves with the current space holders either way you have increased density the last time this happened was when new space was introduced into the game since its unlikely we will be getting new space every expansion its much better to slant 00 income towards active players to draw people out of lowsec and empire with the promise of rewards that they dont need infrastructure to get atonly a little more coming
now of course this doesnt cover the specific balance problems of fuelingseriously a boring stupid mechanic which only serves to exacerbate the feeling that pos need to be hard to kill if no one is coming around to fuel it they arent going to be able to defend it if you come to knock the thing down titansactually all large aoes since they break the entire idea of efficiency loss from focus fire and capitalsoh hey why even bother having battleships when youve got 60 carriers
actually they did bring caps on a number of occasions it has nothing to do with whether or not they brought caps and everything to do with the fact that reinforcement timers let is get back and defend when necessary and that we didnt need to be there in order to make moneybecause there is more to power than the forces on the field at the moment
this is exactly what we were going after in fahtims thread by all means create the perfect solution i think we were pretty close and at the very least in the right directionill posit that 1 exists primarily because of 4 and the subsequent lack of any clear avenues to fight once its over its pretty much over3 can be fixed by more mobility requisites via multigrid solution and with a subcap volatile asset below the pos or sov conflict scalethe mechanic you proposed with the target painter is quite similar to having simultaneous points of contention in that the speed and support will determine who gets to use their dreads and who gets trapped out in dead space where the action isnt going onwhile the vulnerabilities created by a multigrid solution will create avenues for a defender to blob the detachments from the main force is this not the desired solution to 1 where nobody shows up because theyre afraid of 4have a feeling were very very close to a damned near perfect implementation
again poss lack of volatility is what lets this work shorter reinforcement timers maybe 12h and less hpfirepower would have turned those into gs loss of income
i assume youre talking about gss ability to project sov and the threat of wiping another alliances sov if gs had to worry about the subsequent full out assault on their planetary income out in the boonies if gs faced the fact that the defenders would just come back the next day and rewhack the mole this projection of power would lose influence gs could come tear down all of the towers or planetary defense stations or whatever and all that would happen is the defenders would give gs the runaround and go hit a bunch of their planetary income pointsor if the multigrid solution works out well enough they might stick around and try to pick off subcap detachments of gs
no i am not i am talking about how a perfect defense is never testedalso i just got to the point where kelsin wrote the proposal no wonder
think youre getting a little ahead of yourself kanyenah we pretty much abandoned anything with the toxic small gang phrase and just went for a more balanced sov tool most of the input on that thing came from fahtim and i toman wrote the qa on his own did i link the right thread
 op in response to my responsemy best friend told me that diplomacy consists of 90 bs and 10 factits a necessary evil and honestly it makes things go smoothlybut oh welland personally ive learned the hard way not all people are tot
yes you linked the right thread yes kelsin still wrote itno i am not getting ahead of myself you are not understanding what was said its educational first understand why the statement is true and you will understand where your understanding failed
no there must always be one objective not one objective after other sequential objectives just one objective nearly all other solutions result in consolidating forces being the best optionthe only way to make consolidation not optimal is by splitting the battlefields so far its near impossible to travel between them and that presents many many more problemsnope 4 primarily exists because its impossible for iraq to assault the united states of america some organizations are just bigger and badder than others this is a natural progression in semicooperative games there is no getting around it youre gonna get crushed if you set it up so that they could not get crushed then youre still gonna get crushed except instead of being crushed by someone because they had more guys its going to be because they had more money or were playing the game longerblobbing is much certainly the lesser of the three evils
that sums up exactly where we were going with requiring simultaneous points of contention i read your proposed strategy for why the attackers would always fail against such a structure and the thing is there are a hundred fcs who would find ways to counter your defense and a hundred more to find counters for those attacks which can only point to effectiveness of the solutiongs isnt perfect no defense is perfect players arent online 237 though some kia in tde may beg to differ regarding my current activities perfect offense isnt perfect defense you cant win them all you cant be everywhere at the same time some attackers have nothing to lose the laws of entropy will take overyou need to elaborate and not because im misreading what youre saying come out from behind the magic curtain and well talk about it 4 exists because i dont send my three dreads after your ten dreads without a damned perfect strategy and intel thats not so much a law of the game as it is a symptom of the failings of the pos as a sov tool one of the goals of the sov instrument we came up with was to have limited victories and defeats at the satellite structures instead of binary victory or loss when fighting asymmetric sov battles
uhh so youre saying that you want the pds 35 systems away from each other cause otherwise no youre not or youre foolish in thinking that the nodes will be defendable a defense does not need to be perfect to be successful a perfect defense is never tested defenses are only tested when there is a question to their success there is no question to the success of said operations success is determined on an individual basis the possible actions of third parties take little part such they do not occur it is only a matter of scale that prevents gss space being taken by a coalition of alliancesand the alliances we make the same efficiency advantages that protect large alliances with hard to destroy assets protect them with easy to destroy assets in order to reduce the power of the entrenched alliances you need to increase the number of players diluting the power of the larger groups you will not do what with mechanics that retain the entrenched alliances advantages you need to wholly remove said incentive from that cooperative structureimpossible rookie ships will blow up the node before they can make an impact
no it is very much a law of games
myth propagated only within gs persians and greeks hannibal vs romans etc etc gs members seem to like using luke skywalker analogy to poke fun at such concepts as tactical victory over superior forcestruth is that the tactics in eve are washed out by the pos not because players wouldnt be smart enough to use them otherwise go fly losec enough and youll see the difference
tactics only matter when one sides is better than the others but balance must be done for optimal tactics people with bad tactics will lose no matter the balancethat more people beat less people is a law of these semicooperative games it is inviolatesome people in gs laugh about luke skywalker not because they are poking fun at tactical victory over superior forces but because people always think they are luke skywalker they think they have more skills but in eve skills are normalized there are no jedi and while they are variations of the tactical and strategic acumen of humans those people with more tactical or strategic acumen realize that the guy with more guns is probably going to wini suppose you might not believe me but then again most people dont have tactical or strategic acumen have never read the works of anyone who has or had tactical or strategic acumen and have never studied games politics economics or waras for it being a myth no its not eve is a noncooperative asymmetrical game but sovereignty is a zero sum semicooperative gameor hybrid game and combat is a nash game which is why sov is semicooperativehybrid and that means that bigger is better always and forever
gs pop culture and nothing more pwhile it is true that all tactics available and all ships available are available to all and that this would normalize all skills within the balance of the game large alliances are generally pulling out the right tactic for the most important job they have at hand and this should always leaves them open to the use of the right countertactica losec or empire 00 harasser can choose what exposure they have gs cant stop being gsthis mechanic is slowed down not by normalized skills or optimal tactics or more is better but because the pos kills entropy and tells us what to bring and where to bring it it is this fight broker that is screwing up entropyonly gs espouses the notion that the situation that is arises because of fundamental laws of semicoop games its blatant circular logic change the game mechanics and a new fundamental law will be observed its not fundamental but situation specific and entirely driven by stront timers and the low volatility of the pos in this case
if by only goonswarm you mean the last 100 years of economic political and strategic thoughtthe us army sop doesnt say dont engage unless you have a 9 to 1 advantage for no reasonin a world where one side has perfect information the other side does not and the side that has perfect information is the side with less resources to allocate to information gathering and any of that matters because overwhelming force is not appliedlet me explain this to you in the simplest way possible overwhelming force is the one tactic with no countertactic this will always be true bigger will always be better you cannot change that even if you try you keep using that word i do not think it means what you think it meansyou have no clue what you are talking about you want to remove free association from eve that is the only way to change the system that is what a semicooperative game means its a game where there is some order of player cooperation and those entities compete with other entities composed of player cooperation remove andor change stront timers and all you will do is make it easier for gs to attack multiple systems at once it make it easier for others to attack us as well but that is all that a change in stront timing will do a shift in the value of strategies
the problem is youve gone and quoted a large body of academic knowledge regarding zerosum games and all of the meticulously proven behavior regarding those games but eve isnt a zerosum game ccp adds things ccp takes things furthermore theres not unanimous agreement over the proper treatment of opportunities as opposed to resources with regard to how you can model the thingin addition all of the theory surrounding player behavior has been proven bad over and over how good was it for lotka vitra to discover focus firebigger hasnt always been better either i think smash  rk might have actually been bigger in terms of sheer numbers we all know how that ended without even mentioning the older bob or asvn or whatever the hell they were calledthe theory for well described systems has been fleshed out and is good at describing things that are well classified but eve isnt going to classify well and trying to apply game theory without proving that eve fits the classifications for which those proofs hold true is going to get you nowhereso no dont pull out some damned academia stick at us all as if the underlying assumptions have been meti have better marks in organic chem than any doctor who will be opening up your chest someday i know what the entropy is
this has got to be the most civil argument in the history of the eve online forumsi found it quite entertaining to read o oh and please keep it coming guysits a nice change keeps me thinking
power is a zerosum game wealth is not you can make players more wealthy but at the end of the day the part that matters in terms of sov that is zerosumedit also there is no discussions about behavior there only about optimization balancing a game needs to be about what is optimal not what people might doas people will do all sorts of suboptimal things and keeping those who do the optimal things from becoming a hegemony is important in this particular instance we have the optimal thing and the behavioral thing coinciding but that does not necessarily need to be the case in order to make these determinations1 what2 lv failing had nothing to do with discovering focus firebigger is always better that does not mean other things are not also better all it means is that bigger is always better heh apparently not no eve is going to classify pretty easily since it fits the models for pretty much all international relations discussions since well forever its the basic formation of societies and their interactions amongst one another as well as most economic thought regarding monopolies and other coordinated actionsbigger is better you can do nothing about it you can only try and influence individuals to form more coalitions and hope the older ones fall apart
ill take your word for it then
hi ccp since the ghost training change is bad for many people in other ways than just eliminating people cutting in and out of subscriptions you could give us something to sweeten the pot in the training area allow us to switch skills by logging on to our characters account on the eveonline websitebecause so far if you went traveling you wouldnt be able to switch skills on your journey cause you cant start up the game client in some internet cafe in india or wherever elseso the obvious reaction to that would be to let the account expire since youre getting no benefit once the training runs outbeing able to change your training through the website would be great id like it even better if i could change training from my cell phone myself i always keep my main active but i do suspend alts especially cause eve is often just not interesting enough to play it without taking repeated 6 months breaks heres hoping the new performance changes will make large territorial fleet battles a little more fun
thats all good and fine but what of the macroskill training exploit potentialits better if you implement a skill training queue
does it make me a criminal to be a proponent of exploiting the game via skilltraining macroshell i would support online skill training because it would result in a firefox plugin to get around this awful ccp imposed draconian lawgoing to go eat some pizza sick of skill training discussion already ccp give us a skill cache or something of all things in this game i want a skill training cacheokay you could give me 1000bn isk but i would still be almost as happy with a skill training cache
think about it this wayyou got a guy that pays for said account whom also has a isk farming account and all he does is use macros to train all of these accounts and then turns around and sells them for money on ebay or somethingthats what i was referring to
like the idea no i really do although it is a bit weak reallyhow about a mod requiring sov 1 that makes all ships belonging to the sov holder invulnerable and makes all other ships explode when they enter the system now that could provide a much required buff to sov holding blobbers
dont know if this is the right place to post this but i couldnt find one specific to this so if its in the wrong place then i apologiseso the time code debacle goes on with today someone putting up a wts order for 999mil isk for 60days yes you read that right 999000000isk he justified it by saying there is going to be a shortage and he is just jumping in there firstthis begs the question of why is there a shortage in the first place  the removal of the buddy program i think he said unannounced by ccp he mentioned two days notice  which for people who dont frequent the forums is no noticemy view on this is that eve made a major wrong move when they got rid of the 30 day and 90 day time codes 30 days time codes used to sell in their hundreds every day on the bazaar 90 days time codes used to sell in their hundreds as wellccp made a lot of money this way but they wanted to bump their prices up and they tried to hide it behind streamlining well anyone with a calculator could see that it was a price increase on the time codes despite what ccp wanted to call it they basically tried to hide the fact that it was going up in price why what is the sense in that did ccp not trust their game was good enough and people would leave in their droves because they said they were putting their prices upat 3499 for 60 days this game is still remarkably cheap compared to other mmos so why did ccp try to go about it a clandestine manneranyway back to the time codes people need choices those of us who dont have credit cards or use debit cards or have bank accounts yes there are still people who do not use these things believe it or not buying time codes with isk earned in the game is now my only option but i cannot afford to pay out 550mil isk for a time code i would have no money left to buy stuff in the game and the game would cease to be a game anymore if i have to spend all my time earning isk in game to pay these huge prices for a time codealso with the prices of time codes going up all the time it means people are getting more and more isk from selling them and surely that will have an effect on the economy in the game in real life when economies are flooded with cash inflation spirals to higher and higher levelsccp do the qen to tell us about this and how this game is being used as a model economy in studys by real economists what do they think of this influx of iskall in all it seems a very bad idea by ccp to leave us with no options to pay for the game the greedy will only ask more and more isk for their time codes and the part time players will dispappear if they cant afford the new prices me included ccp have literally priced me out of the game with what they have done and i am sure i am not alonemy son currently needs a time code for his character as his account has now expired i can only afford 475mil isk to buy one but my wtb posts are simply ignored on the forums and now he has no game to play i will probably be following shortlybut what do you think
yes but will we see account numbers droppeople using less accounts means less foreign currency
will mommy and daddy still pay for juniors account when the bills mount upcan the multi account man afford all his accounts when redundancy loomsare we moving towards single account playersi already know of players who have left because of money worries
if you look at the demographics of eve i would highly doubt its the kind of folks that are getting hit hard by the credit crunchsome people will always leave but thats always true
i hope your rightbut as a side thought so much of this game is team based should ccp introduce more single player content
bumping to see if theres any other good ideas
you are completely overreacting herelook the minutes will eventually be outi have no idea when they will but im sure they are being worked on please wait for those as i hate to actually disclose things before they are actually official i dont want to upset anybodyas it has been stated tons of times before the initial response from ccp plus whatever extra there is to add from our meetings will be posted together in the official minutes also its baseless claims that it has been ignored and avoided by ccp ccp gave us an answer and theres nothing to discusshowever as serenity said ccp was interested in the actual suggestion and there was talk about the actual thing in regards to small anchorable structures so we might see it being put in there
there was open dialogue we were fully allowed to discuss it directly but obviously there was no reason for it due to the actual response ccp is well aware that this is on the top of our wishlist but we cant tie ccps hands behind its back and force them to do it eitherim sorry we couldnt do more than this sadly i think its a matter of bad expectations
didnt notice the pretty pictures all i have to say is nice
implement asapi went on the test server a while back just to learn how to set up a pos what a nightmarea pos should look similar to a station not like a bunch of floating space debris
bane is this something youd want to discuss at the next csmccp meeting
nvmd
we already discussed it we passed it and now ccp knows about it sheesh
good news then hopefully they will do somethingi think i misread the other topic for being the actual meeting w ccp
supported i love burning mini caps  hugs moros but a nice balllance there owuld be nice and dont make it a nerf get it right ccp you cant afford another cluster youve already got 2 on your plate gtcs ghost training
supported ccp should rethink and stop the patch tomorrow
i know its a little bit late but seriously how does less people  bigger fights
this has been around for far to long as is supported by their own documentationthis is a bad idea and even as someone who has never ghost trained this is a notch down on the customer service scale imho
can i say ive never taken advantage of the ghost training bug nocan i say i agree with the way they suddenly banned ghost training nocan i say im upset with the ghost training thing being stopped noi know some skills take forever and a day to train and ive felt that sting bs 5 anybody but i think ccp was well in their right to stop the process for too long people have been playing without paying both in rp sp market orders etc its about time ccp stopped the process and let the game be truly player driven instead of inactive account driventhe longterm effects are that some vets will stop playing which is neither good nor bad and that less capital ships will be fielded which is good honestly i do wish theyd stop all gain from inactive accounts and implement the skill queue but one step at a timei cannot support this thread as this is ccps game and we just play to share in their virtual world and maybe even change it a bit kudos ccp
i support eve not being a  hole pice of crap but if thats what ccp wants to do then they can find new jobs for all i care and i can find a new gameblack prophecy looks good and so dose jump gate evo by by ccp lies and greed will not be tolerated by me
stop the patch
poorly thought out change even more poorly handled
im just using this post as an exampleseriously why do people need 5 accounts when 3 or 4 of them are ghosttrained what are people doing with 5 accounts i have two im paying all timei can understand the decission and support it imho professional ghost training is like macromining paying less money for a character not really playing it skill it to capship and then selling it for billions on the charactermarket isnt the way ccp intended the players to uses this feature of the gamein addition to that i think ccp is aware of the fact that they will loose subscribers and accepted thatbesides that the financial situation cant be that bad for ccp because they want to hire people againin addition would it changed anything when they asked the community about it that would have changed nothing for anybody of those that are grumbled about itps can i have the stuff of those that quit the game just contract the stuff on my character

gets my vote epic faildian
1eve actively kept ghost training in clearly it was not a bug2unlike other mmorpgs eve does not reward you with how much you play it rewards you with how long your sub is in wow someone can go exp mad and reach end content in a few months whereas in eve it will take a good year to be good in a ship not great in it you pay to train when you buy a sub ghost training only seems fair as eve slows you down by a hell of a lot compared to other mmorpgs basically to be good in eve you have to pay around 500 under the new change which is a fking rip off and blatantly nothing other than a grab for money
i disagree with this change and the sudden way in which it was introduced and not to mention the timing of the introduction after a recent power of two promotion
disagree  its not fair to paying customers that people who dont pay end up with the same advantages for less money at the end of the day
time to quit and find a new game

exceptionally stupid move by ccp3
i oppose the ban on ghosttraining for all the reasons that have already been covered
supported but ccp wonUFFFDt listen anyway as they didnUFFFDt with gtc changeskind of sad to see ccp going the greedy mainstream way
i have canceled all of my accounts because of this change while i enjoy this game i will not resub until ccp reinstates ghost training
its nice to see people with a differentiated viewi honestly dont like character farmers or multiple alts for every possible task being ghost trained for best minmaxing effectivenessthe deliberate exploitation of this feature surely is something that hurts the gameand anything that makes eve less altsonline is highly appreciatedhowever as has been mentioned many many times the fashion in which it was done is absolutely intolerableapart from that ccp is about to devalue their service and take away something special about eve add to that the price increase for subscriptions and all you can say is thats not going to benefit the game a fact which players who really care about the game should be and actually are concerned abouttheres definitely a lack of balancing in ccps business decisions
the please visit your user settings to reenable images was quite the lulz thoughi mean come on respect your bloody playerbaseseriously ccp i miss 05
for several reasons stated in ghost posts s i am not happy with this decisioni think everyone used that feature at least once due to rl commitments or even boredomthe way this subject has been handled by ccp is a joke liars and greedy people they are if i did this in my rl job i would be fired in no time they show lack of respect to me and playerbasei have 2 accounts suspended already will keep this one at least at the start of novemberccp is greedyccp is liarccp is disrespectfulccp is joke and we are part of this circus
i dont see why ccp would take the almost certain to happen risk of loosing both money and market share in the long run by further alienating some of its fanbase with this decision
redrum
keep ghost skillingor even better remove ghost skilling and overhaul the crappy skill system so that the more complex skills dont take 30 days and more to finish even with implantswaiting a month fo a skill to finish is almost as entertaining as drinking from a pubvlic toilet
this feature should remain
i vote to keep ghost training ingame until a suitable alternative is on the table for those it affects also sort out your lack of customer service out ccp goddamn more shennanagins
1though does there really need to be 2 identical threads to discuss this im sure the 125 page official one is enough
1 account this ghost training nerf and the heavy handed speed nerf ends it for me
i would see ghost training as a compensation for the slow learning curve eve has and also as an incentive to get back after breaks

i vote for ghost training it was the only way i could keep competitive sp wise with older players as my play time is irregular and scarcei hate that all of this is a lie being an unintended bug and all its not the first ccp has told but as it stands now it is the last lie ill be fed if ccp would of said listen we are taking out ghost training because we want to it was a feature but because we want to change it it will be removed then maybe i would still play the gameas i play more than 2 mmos with little time for play i would pay for eve with brakes of 2 or 3 weeks but i would pay happy to return as my recon 5 skill finished eager to take my recon for a ride now i will not pay at alli vote to keep ghost training in the game
this is the worst most appalling and ghastly idea i have seen ccp implement so abruptly in the time i have spent with this gamethere is no justifiable reason to implement this idea now for ccp to cover it up with the rouge that ghost training is an exploit is an insult ghost training has been and advertised feature which has been a deciding factor for many to subscribe to an account i am simply not interested in the explanation that it was an unintentional bug which has been used by players this feature which ccp has advertised has been used for 5 years now and it is deplorable to suddenly withdraw it with virtually no warningwe will see whether ccp have made a bad move by noting the active subscriptions over the forthcoming months

a good rethinking of this idea would be that we can all log off and have a que of skills train one after the other with an active accountso before ccp remove this ghosting feature  well ok its no longer a feature due a day slow ninjaedit  they should add something

my wish is simple i want my ghost skill training back
i support getting stuff for freethat said go ahead and cancel it
given its supposedly about fairness and the matter of ongoing market orders and research points has failed to be mentioned by the devs shows this to be only a cynical move to raise more funds if fairness was an issue ccp would have gone out its way to open up the debate weeks ago and at least pretend to listen to its communitythe manner of this announcement and subsequent clarification stinks of the ccp handling of the t20 cheating dev scandal  did you learn nothing ccp those ccp staff who have handled this matter need some serious training as they will likely have cost the company alot of revenue start by telling the truth not using smoke and mirrors at a time when folks are struggling financially adding insult to injury will be a final straw for manyfinally this move hits the core player base of veterans with multiple accounts hardest is ccp so confident or arrogant that its game works so perfectly with so few issues it can afford upset many in this key group
your own player guide said it was intentional and now its cancelled due to it being a bugbull you want more money you already explained this by adjusting timecards so you increased profit to be more in line with other monthly mmo ratesnow you want even more money  off you can call it a bug all you want but it was supported by your company in word and deed for years do us a favor and tell us you want more money dont bother lying and calling it a bug
signed ccp needs to grow a brain
stuff can has plix
the one and only logical reason for not having a skill queue in the first place has vanished i demand urgent nay immediate implementation of an unlimited or at least ridiculously large both in length and size skill training queue please show support update  good news 
ps having to post again just to show support to your own thread  bleah
signedat least give 5 skill queue having to go online for couple small skills is ridiculous especially if they finish at night
easy now akita theyre too busy dealing with all the spin needed to calm down the incessant whining to actually develop anything right nowjust imagine what the petition queue is going to be like from all the evemon said it should be done training and it isnt complaintsedit oh and to the idea i think i would actually prefer that instead of a queue it would just continue training the current skill until level v or completed this would be much faster to code possibly within a day and it just seems to make more sense to me
would be nice to have some kind of queue  be it a definable one or just train current skill to vhowever im not going to quit if its not implemented
evemon works great but it cant change my skill trainingi pay for my two accounts a year at a time if i am unable to access the game for a time eg my computer explodes how do i change my skill training give us the ability to queue our skillsand possibly give evemon the ability to do iti agree 100 there is no valid reason that ccp cant code a large skill queue into this game unless they dont know how to do it which i seriously doubtsigned
yep
i agree
skillque  skilling multiple chars on one account please with only one char capable of queueskillingtake some give some 
lookie here  linkagequoted
this is what i am thinking tooplease ccp ab
supportedi play eve parttime and eve is great for casual play aside from the having to dash off in the middle of dinner mowing the lawn washing the dog or walking the car to change a skill part just a 23 skill limited queue would do ty
skill queue hell yeah its been asked for at least as long as ive been playing as has the killing of ghost training ill even train levels of advanced learning for extra queue slots if i have to 1 queue slot for everyone with no training 1 more for each level trained or just the train same again either works for those oh crap i have forgotten to set a skill and its another 13 hours before i get home again momentsdan
im in a very cynical mood today thanks to the mistake of actually going near the forums yesterday so ill moodily predict this gets locked or merged because were supposed to only have one thread per topic and theres already a skill queue issue edit oh and this thread mentions ghost training so that doubles the chances immediatelythat said damn the torpedoes full steam ahead i support this longaskedfor notion as wholeheartedly as i did the last hundred times this topic has come up
yes now we definetly need a skill queue
a queue of 1 extra skill would be enough it would fiy all problems with skill training if your pc broke or the server cluster is down etc
with ghost training gone there is really no harm in an inifinite queue
i agree a skill training queue would be great especially now you can only train whilst paying for ithell they might have even killed off the ghost training because they are planning to bring in such a change and dont want it abused
i support this idea
i agree the only reasons for not having a skill queue were nuked along with ghost training full support hereedit i said full support but i forgot to check the box huurrr
skill queue is an excellent way to attract more people from the casual player and multiple mmo player crowd
while id like to see a skill queue implemented as much as you and ive been very vocal about the subject theres already a long loooong thread about this already herecsm  ccp meeting 001  0001 skill queue functionalityi dont see the need for another thread on the subject really sorryedit in a true gallente spirit i need to add that if you want this made different or want to have a more active role in the priorities ccp assign to important subjects nominate yourself for the csm if you promise to bring this topic to ccp so they put it in a higher priority ill vote for you promisemeanwhile ill accept what the current csm and ccp have decided for this matter
well i guess the differencekeywords would be unlimited or close to unlimited and now
yeah i knowi believe i have answered to this in my edition to my previous post
i actually have given it some thought the csm thing but there are twothree issues at hand herefirst i hate travelling and i dont have a valid passport last one expired about a year ago only used it once in the 5 years it was valid especially since normally i wouldnt need a passport to enter iceland eu member in the first placesecond i really cant be out of the country in the dateperiod the csm is supposed to be meeting and i have this nagging sensation i wouldnt really be able to attend all online meetings of the csm eitherfinally i really dislike ndas and i would feel extremely restricted by the terms i would be forced to obey by if i signed them especially since my life philosophy is nearly full disclosure on just about everythingbottom line while i could make a decent csm member under ideal rl circumstances i really dont feel up to it right now at some later time maybe
no reason not to do this please implement
this and above
this and the 30d gtc
150no reason not to implement this now
the only reason not to have a queue is because of ghost training with that gone i too demand skill queueing since im paying for my skill training i demand the right have my character train nonstop while my account is activein all honestly this is a perfectly good compromize one of the worse thing about not having a skill queue is sometimes you just cant get home on time or youre internet goes down or youre out of town and a skill ends then you miss hours or days of possible trainingi use to make up for this fact ever since i started playing to be honest and train a nice long skills ghost style it cant be that hard to have at least 5 or 10 skills in a queue that train instantly after one finishesits not a tall order ccp and infact its a damn nice customer friendly feature you want to remove some heat from ghost training implament skill queueing
yes please
should have gone live with the disabling of ghost training for pr if nothing else

four things akita first youre acting like a boor  you do not demand when you do not have any manner of control whatsoever second this issue has already been brought to ccp and theyve given their response third ghost training was never a logical reason to not have a skill queue  you just stop the queue when your account is unpaid every single skill queue thread ever advocated that solution fourth you dont have to post in support of your own thread immediately  i find it far better practice to hold back and support my first response less spammy and a higher support ratio i support a skill queue but not this thread
ditto im completely disgusted with the attitude and motivation of the op and anyone who follows in there disgruntled fashionbut i do support the idea but for completelyand non selfishespecially for non demanding reasonsif you people dont like it then leave the game after all no one said you had to keep paying for itme herschel ftw

voting no against the nano nerf terrible idea too heavy handedapproach it differently removing a style of play instead of finding ideas and new roles new ships to counter blobs as well as nanos is more interesting and creative again so far i see this as another bad idea from the devs you guys need some civil or mechanical engineers on that dev squad i swear 69 pages of no votes against 32 votes for the nerf yikes 21 time to listen this time already accounts closing due to the gtc  not whining just the truth and now this where is a shark when when have the fonz all ready for itbrka brka brka
obvious a lot of goons used this inactive feature so i propose ccp goes thru with the change maybe some goons will leave yay
if you dont pay you should get nothing
this just in ccp apparently run by the director of kaupUFFFDing banki
i agree with all inactive gain parts stop market orders stop rp gain stop skill traininggtcs should still be used to reactivate an account and corporations should still be active if they have some paying members players should have their characters dropped if the following three conditions apply theyve been inactive for six or more months they have less than 2m sp they have not paid their account for six monthsgiven these conditions im willing to bet that a great deal of player and corp names will suddenly become available as the older characters that were started in a trial or such are suddenly droppedthis move will clear up the database and give freedoms back to the players name selection etc i support this topic even if it was sarcasm
lets run the game into the ground signed i support killing eve
supported fairs fair tbh i have never used this feature erm sry bug but i think ghost training can go both ways tbh really unless you have crap stats eventually you will have to pay up to keep training so honestly i dont care either way butas it has been pointed out yes rp and isk gain should be disabled aswellprops for pointing this out op
agree
dont forget about jobs in npc stations like material research and selling bpos with high me for profit
why not delete all those trial accounts people who have not paid a penny to ccp
yes remove the real issues or none at allghost training should stay
agreedprogress on skills rp market manufacturing research ect should all halt on unpaid accounts corporation title positions however should be maintainedhow to deal with pos run by a single ghost account that lacks any other corporate members to maintain it however does it continue to consume fuel until it runs out should it go offline immediately
guess i did forget to support my own thread hehe beside its got buried in the ghost training complaints fallout

yeah bring um back  they make good watching 
and yet you didnt click the support button
i didnt know they ever disappeared giev plz
it has my support in principle but i am not giving it a thumbs up i would say seeing eve tv return is a far higher priority than the alliance tournaments
yes brings it back
erm yes of course we want more tourniments
supported
i want to watch more of these kinda want evetv back too but thats not what this thread is about
supported
or at least no prizes with redeemable isk value
yup theyre great television no more state issue ships though  the universal standings rewards were nice and the lp wasnt bad but giving bob 300 billion worth of unique ships was a bit much as an alternative prize replace every ship and module lost by anybodyand give them all to the winning team it makes the whole thing not affect the economy at all but still provides a huge incentive to win
supported in full theyre fun to watch and are one of the reasons eve stands out over so many other mmorpgs
yes but we still get to reserve the right to  about the rules officiating and still get to tell the commentators that they are noobsahhh such fun stuff i love the alliance tournies
terrible ideaon the other hand they really need to add skill queue system now that ghost training will get disabled
im all for the removal of learning implants and some learning skills theyre a real barrier to new players and hold people back from pvp from the fear of podding but the training times as they stand are about right really a reduction of 50 would make it far too quick to train into roles people have spent a long time training
so more targets to shoot at personally i feel that the training times are a bit long bearable as they are now but having them shorter would be helpful
right and what about the people that have been here 3 or 4 or 5 years already and have tens of millions of skill points are you going to reimburse them 30 million skill points that they can then effectively double their already insane amount of skills this will do nothing but keep you at the bottom of the proverbial social skill hierarchy because they will still be so far ahead of you youll never catch up for instance if you have 2 million sp and they have 60 you go up to 4 million skill points while they go up to 120 million skill points or worse skill points take as long as they do so that not everybody is flying around in titans and capitol ships 6 months after they start the gamei think you have your whole frame of mind messed up you shouldnt be paying to train skills its a waste of money play for the experience that is eve online you can still have fun without having x million skillpointswhile i do agree that it would be nice if caldary battleship 5 didnt take a month to complete if youre lucky the alternative is just as bad
what has one to do with the other apples and oranges
no wow is that way 
the long training times to get to where you want to be is good its eve we have had this for over 5 years and to be honest the people who have had it easy are the nerer players rather than the older players skill times arent broke so dont mess with them
i think you got my suggestion wrong what im proposing is reducing training times so it doesnt take over one year for me or anyone else to fly a command ship properly with decent skillsfor all the older player that are worried about newer players getting something you didnt youll recieve 50 of the value of the sps you presently haverodj blake  youre the same age as my ceo so id guess youd have the same amount of sps as he has around 70mil sps  my suggestion would give you approximately 35mil sps and im sure youd find something to use them ondrake draconis  post on your main if this is your main you dont know what your talking aboutjin habarre  i dont want to fly every races ship to battleship i just want to fly minmatar ships to bs to their maximum ability
no its completely interrelated if ccp didnt like ghost training then implimenting a queue so people could ghost train 234 or more skills without ever subscribing would be clearly bad so now they have no excuse
so err why is that good again maybe if you dont want to spend a year doing it you shouldnt be flying a command ship there are plenty of ships that are smaller and easier to train
i think everyone got that point quite clearly it is just that most seem to agree that this is exactly the way it should be with less than a year you dont have the logistics supplies and buddies to make much use of one anyway you dont need a command ship to make a commanding impact on the battlefieldnightmare cant think of any other word for itthe game is not about getting what you want just because you want it now while at the same time breaking the whole game world to get you there your suggestion doesnt work plain and simple if you think it through it would be a total catastrophe for the game eve would be nothing but junk in less than 6 months
it took me one year so why should you do it faster
while in concept shorter training time is nice and i would love it my selfits could never be fair to the peaple who trained there skils on the slow timernow you could say the peaple get sp depost that they can spend in anny skil they want is not going to change annything in what some peaple would call the spskil ladderlet alone then alot of peaple would be able to do everything and im sure alot of peaple wil have nothing to train for that wil have a use for them so they spend it in things that there never going to useyes it can take some time to train into something and yes it can be boring but you have friends and corp mates for that who can help ya or you can tag along with them in those pvp op mining and missionssp  not skilskil is learned in game not with stats and spso i give a big no for this
this
i may have changed my mind
its goons what good can come from it
you state this as a fact but its an opinion how about some argumentation to back up your opinion and provide some valid points into this discussionbesides if you think black ops are different since they have a special role why not make a difference for 100 passive 4bn ships as well they already are a different breed of ships since it doesnt require capital ships skill but are treated by the majority as a capital ship
if you dont have the support  brains to jump into low sec and go through a gate to high sec you probably shouldnt be flying this ship cynoing to highsec takes all the risk out  its not that hard to cyno to lowsec next to high sec and use a gate and still exposes you to risk you can cyno out of highsec thats good enough
was looking at smartbombs today we got all sizes including micro smartbombs why not also capital as it stands to get a good smartbomb u have to pay a minimum of 100 mill ts and a realy good one up to 45 bil pls for us capital pilots give us a capital smartbomb d
i suport miself
we need it suported
why
efective at close range say give it bit more dmg like 2 k but over longar duration and 1013 km range dwhell fleet ops realy good lag killars couse they reduce the amount of lag using capitals would kill even more dronesjust my 2 cents
smartbombs arent good as they are calculation intensiveso thats not something i can support
there are already 4 capital smartbombs in the gameaurora ominaegjallarhornjudgementoblivioni think thats enough
enough thats 4 too manyalso posting in a i want factionofficer mods without paying factionofficer mod prices thread
i could support this given some changes in how smartboms work most notably have them emanate from the centre of the ship not the edges give capital sbs a longer range and in effect itll be the same as what they have now also this gives you room to better buff the officer smartbombs because youre then not affecting the balance of supercapital ships when you do so of course since i think scatim has the right idea here i dont think ill be supporting you
thank youso  how near might this future be is it going to be soontm meaning we should resign ourself for the duration or will it actually be a definition of near recognizable as suchoh and i like the idea of space claimed by alliances that have joined a faction as being claimed by the faction obviously theres some work to do in terms of figuring out what that would mean but i certainly dont oppose the concept
agree
i really dont think its going to happen unless you weaseled a way thru some new fw content and schemes unless its a total rehaul of fw which is why i highly doubt the smoke and mirrors you toss out youve fought hard on an issue that very few side with and in return you have disregarded the thousands of people who are currently involved in fw and the original intent of fw involving alliance in fws current state would be a disaster lets hope you had good sense to talk about the mechanics of it rather than the wawawaaa whines behind roleplayers
i will again refer you to
its going to happen negative its clear the majority of players want this to happen negative you are not thousands of players and you dont speak for thousands of players you are one player and you have made your argument and in the final analysis it was found wanting in the process of debate and i dont believe you are qualified to speak of the orginal intent of fw any more than you can represent a vast unspoken majority face facts weve had the discussion and you didnt convince anyoneof course the mechanics were discussed and as a solution i think it will satisfy pretty much everyone
first of all im at work and havent had the time to read the whole thread so much of this may have already been shot downi really like uglebs idea but would suggest a few minor changesa make the average standing entry level be dependent on meber standings rather than corp standings ie all members in uk must have an average minnie standing of xx to join also make a minimal standing requirement that applies to all members ie uk cant join if any member have a negative standingb make it so that no 00 sov holdning alliance can join fw this will screw over cva pretty bad of course as well go for a few months and then see the old youre not rpers at all etc being thrown our way all the time but it would allow all other rp entities to join im not aware of any other rp alliances holding sov anywhere it would also mean that no 00 non rp alliances would ever join not optimal but i cant see why we should restrict uk sf and all the others simply to accomodate the one 00 holding rp alliancec in order to compensate poor old cva and uk should they ever decide to grab a bit of 00 again make it so that you can set standing to the factions as a whole ie cva could set standing to the minnie faction in one go and any corp or alliance joining would then be subject to that standing we could participate but at a cost to our sec ratings not optimal i know but far better than nothingquestion is wether ccp will asign programmer resources to actually rectify the complete screwover they did of the rp community when they introduced fw i doubt itill pay some better attention to this thread when i get off work and will probably find im wrong UFFFDn all of the above points
give them their fw so i can go about my piraty business in peace wishful thinking
please maybe just give us a limit of saving our last 10 emails add some sort of organization to the email system im not asking for a new version of outlook just something simple
this suggestion is a part of our second package of issues which i hope will get posted sometime in the near futurelook forward to that
right now the work around is save em in your notesbut if this is implemented at least let it only be an option you can enabledisable as some ppl might not want this featureeither way ill support it as is
speaking of email difficulties the sorting options are simply insane lets tsay i want to look at my new emails i sort by unread i then click on the first person whos sent me mail i havent read i click on the unread mail so far so goodlets say the mail was a inquiry into joining my corp and i want to respond well at this point the person who sent the mail no longer counts as unread which means that although im still reading the mail the persons entry in my mail list has been resorted to some arbitrary position in the list and has been unselected this means that if i want to find out who sent it that information is not encoded into the mail itself so i need to note the subject line and look through each person in my inbox until i find the person who has an email with the matching subject lineor lets say my corp is having a discussing using corp mail no matter how i sort the mails theres no way to read posts in the order that they were read meaning that context is lost unless everyone quotes the mail they responded towho thought this stuff up this needs to be changed so that at a minimum1 i can display a chronological list of mails recieved this would likely require the index to display individidual posts along with timestamps to sort by2 sender is always displayed along with the mailsome useful extras3 make the sender tag that gets added to the message a link so that i can click on it and bring up mails that ive saved from that person4 change the index portion of the screen depending on sort type if i sort by sender it shows me an entry for each sender and i can click on a sender to bring up a list of messages from that sender if i sort by timestamp it shows me a list of the most recent few subject lines with sender and timestamp along with links to pages older messagestheres a lot of email systems out there to model it on none of which come close to being as bad as the one in evefunny story a while back i recieved an ingame mass email from a developer asking for feedback on an event i had participated in he wanted us to respond to his outside email and said that the reason he wanted us to respond outside the game was that the ingame email was horriblein any case any improvement to the ingame mail system would be fantastic
there are faction drone bpcs the augmented drones not actual drone faction ships right
op dont even try to get highsec missioners into lowsec itll fail yes if it wasnt for all that annoying pvp the pvplegal space would be pretty nifty
as nice and nifty as irony can be it misses the point unless someone had said pvp should be prohibited in lowsec that is not the case thoughas it is the galaxy is more or less divided into9998 safe highsec0 safe lowsec0 safe 00the thing that would make highsec players go into lowsec would be9998 safe highsec900 safe lowsec0 safe 00i think that this is much more what ccp had in mind when they made the distinction between high and low security space they just underestimated players fear to venture into the unknown as it is most of lowsec is more dangerous than most of 00 and that misses the whole secpart in lowsec it could as well be called nosec added to 00 and be done with itit is likely true that it is bloody near impossible to lure players that normally wouldnt go into lowsec with some kind of glittering prizes the reason for most not to go is not the lack of opportunities it is the lack of safetywhile you can almost completely safely fly around highsec in a shuttle even a short singlejump trip to 04 in a tanked battleship can be fatal with the relevant factor being nothing but bad luck people dont put their faith in karma though those who dislike losing dont go where the odds are completely unknown if they were partly known and if they could rely on equalizing factors to at least some degree some of them would venture forthand dont just say that something will fail because fail will failingly fail to unfailthere are many ways to skin a mink and if player psychology and game development were so easy to predict a lot of game concepts would be completely different and at least 90 of all nerfs and buffs would never have been necessary in the first place i leave it to those who do this stuff for a living to iron out the details of any potentially useful direction and since i have been in such a position myself before i know that it is possible beyond what most on the outside may anticipatea thing that will always fail is any attempt to persuade a large amount of people to make a jump into the dark only few will make that jump while most will hesitate first or not do it at all making them jump into a slightly darker shade of grey is much easier though one step then the next and the next and before they realize they will willingly fly where no searchlights penetrate the darkness anymore
i dislike the idea of randomized concord presence in lowsec very muchif a pirate should attack a person he would then be xx likely to be instaganked by concord seriously not a good ideaif you wish to go down this road id rather see permanent concord presence in lowsec  but of far less effectivenes and response time than you see in highsec so if for instance a priate attacks a hauler in 04 he is set upon by a standard battleship rat and 2 cruiser rats but if he does the same in 01 hes only met by one rat cruiser im still not in love with this idea thoughid rather actually make lowsec more rewarding compared to high sec the problem with this is that making lowsec missions more rewarding would introduce a lot of extra isk into the game as well as potentially making lowsec more rewarding than 00 the answer is obviously to nerf mission rewards in both lp and isk in high sec at the same time as low sec is boosted or you could go by maras original idea  with the slight change that only lowsec missions can escalate this would still of course introduce additional iskies into the game so a similar isksink would need to be introduced my suggestion is to reduce mission rewards in high sec  but obviously even if this is necessary its not going to happen
that doesnt work out because it will end up pouring money into the pockets of those who are there anyway while it would lure only very little new people inany kind of npc presence that gets weaker in terms of firepower the further out it goes also makes no sense concord and the empire factions fleet commands would have to be braindead if that was the case the more dangerous an area is the harder you hit if you do so in the first placeeventually it would be like modern slums in africa or south america little to no police presence ever but when they come they come in full force they come armed to the teeth and they shoot first ask questions later they will not do it often thoughthat is how lowsec should be the slums of the empirekeep the background of the game world in mind not just the game mechanics the mechanics have to fit the setting not the other way around
i dont get why people feel they have a right to get all of the ingame benefits for using the op as an example eight accounts if they are only paying for three of them at any time if i go to a restaurant with seven friends and pay for three meals should i expect the restaurant to feed all eight of us if i subscribe to eight magazines then stop paying for five of them should i expect the publisher to keep sending all eight since im such a good customer if i subscribe to a newspaper and cancel it how long should i expect them to keep delivering itcmon folks its a game that we pay to play and ccp is in the business of making making by entertaining us players began to more and more blatantly take advantage of the training system so they finally decided they had to revise it how many other premium online games not only let you improve your character while not actually playing but allow you to do so while not subscribing to the game i ackowledge that you got used the way they had been doing it but i challenge you to head over to wow subscribe unsubscribe and check back in a month to see how many levels youve gained heck stay subscribed but dont play and see how many levels you gainin any case im not sure what your proposal is but if it involves you getting an advantage by training multiple accounts without even the slight mitigating factor of paying for multiple accounts then you can consider meunsigned
well if that is what you have then that is a little bit more than what i havebesides sp do not matter on this subject anyway i know quite a few people who have been playing since beta and did not even know what ghost training was and they have nearly 90 mill spright now i have cruiser v going and i am just playing the game like i normally do but it seems 26 days for some of you is like a death sentence and thus enter ghost training i happen to like playing the game no matter how long of a skill i have
its not a death sentence per se but after paying 3 months of doing nothing so i could cancel for one and come back to being barely useful instead of completely useless feels kind of like i got betrayed if im feeling betrayed i dont even want to know how the people who fell for the power of two feel
can i have your stuff honestly everyone knew it was a bonus and never an intended featureit sounds like ccp has been fine with a low level of it and the recent surge ed them off i dont even have to log in to advance no other game has that during a really busy week if we finally get a skill queue i will be all set

the best proposal ive heard is making a rig that allows any ship to be dropped via covert bridge itd be interesting to see an eas do that however as a straight ship effect i cant support it  you want a bridging ewar ship use a force recon
fuel problem even if bops get fixed eass are going to be easier to send through the tunnel also given that eass are more or less scale models of recons in terms of their ewar the question is why cant eass already be sent through the tunnel
i am procommunication yes
im gonna use reverse psychologyccp ignore everything i say k
yes
one of the things we internally in csm has taken note of is the bad communication that ccp has suffered with recentlyso yes this is a large issue
i am very much in favor of ccps move to eliminate ghost training that having been said it would not have hurt to give a bit more notice for those whod been abusing the system as it existedregarding the date for the nanonerf i disagree i think its fine to state what they plan to do preferably with as much detail as possible and welcome reasonable discussion while not giving a specific implementation date
ive always supported greater and better communication it was one of ccps strong points when i first joined and one of the reasons i took an instant liking to eve compared to the experience id had in other mmos
i agree communication hasnt been as good as it could have been one thing i can say is that the bigger your company grows the harder it becomes to fix up the communication problems its a pain to iron out the flaws but very rewarding for both the company and the customers in the end
ok so this bug has now been removed where people who were not paying subscription fees no longer got free skill training for their charactersone of the cases for ghost training was when people couldnt afford the full subscription charge so would be away for some time so how about ccp introduce a downtime subscription whereby someone can pay a greatly reduced amount say 5 a month so they can keep skill training going of course you wont be able to log in to the game so as to prevent exploitationplayers would manage their own account and set those long skills before the reduced subscription kicks inso ccp gets their income and customers have the choice to keep their characters skill training going albeit at a reduced cost
it would be handy and if it doesnt take vast amounts of programming effort for some reason then why not
i agreesometing more comprehensive then the tag column should be developed
problemthe use of skill training based play in general is a capitalist based decision as a company you can have thousands of paying accounts without having to host their bandwithprocessing power as most of them are offline awaiting for the next skill to complete so they can get into their bigger or better class of ship i can understand the choice here as a corporation to base the decision on player leveling this way however as a mostly player run game or so i am toldhope i would ask that things be looked into so that a more even playing field be createdsolutionlearn the lesson from the game earth and beyond and make player skill advancement a situational event lets look into this from a few different prospectives shall wepirate the first time you pop a insert race frigate this should be worth alot of sp however on the 50th identical pop it should be worth next to nothing as it is not a new event or spending 20 total hours on a gate camp should be worth more sp then spending the same amount of time docked online or offline ships and modules should be base on hours playednew events and not offline training those req skills and having the money one encourages a player to be envolved in the game and the other encourages a player to be offline training for the most partmission runner each mission should be worth sp lvl 1  x lvl 2  x2 so on and so on you are actively online and doing something and should get more of a sp reward then someone who is offline standing increases be damnedminer first veld is alot of sp 50th is next to nothing someone who has mined thousand of m3 of bistot should have more sp then someone who has only mined a few hundred m3 activly mining should be worth more sp then being offine money be damnedyou see where i am going with this one way rewards the guy who plays 20hours a day more then the guy who plays 2 is this not fairsolution t2 in depthi propose the followinga multiplier be added just for being online ie intel base  20  11 onlinea multiplier be added for each event like reward  mined roid  class  frequency of class or roid or destroyed ship  class  frequency of class or shipmodules and ships have an added requirement of time invested in the previous class example you should need to log 10hours in a frigate before being able to use a cruiser same thing with a module 20 hours and 3000 rounds required with the t1 varity before graduating to the t2 flavor note the times and roundsshots are up for argumentpeople with multiyear accounts and hundreds of kills  losses be given block sums of sp to invest in the areas that they choose this way the guys with 200hours total online and a 4 year old account cant be over taken by the guy with a 4 month old account who has played 200hours total onlineoptional extrathe ability to take and this could be a pay feature sp from a skill and put it into another field ie 20mil invested in being a miner take it all and invest it into pvp or pvein conclusiondont screw over the people who have invested their time and money thru the years and come up with a repayment method for them and in the future require an online time investment with actual gameplay sitting in station does not cut it for all future shipmoduleskill uselet justice be done
no thanks eves sp system is one of its most outstanding aspects and rewards both casual and hardcore players without turning the game into a grindfest korean mmo it also prevents players from feeling pigeonholed into one class because of an uninformed decision they made when they first started the gameyour solution would encourage players to keep their computers on 247 and force people to log on just after downtime to log onto eve again if they wanna max out their sp gains in addition it would mean that being a jack of all trades character is manditory and force players to go around doing every possible activity they can think of in order to collect sp either that or start macromining but in any case it would make having a single focused profession completely impractical
this is a dreadful horrible ideafrom day 1 eves skill system has been an outstanding idea that differentiates it from the other ty mmos and means its not a grind to develop your character the grind is for isk but even that isnt true for people who make isk not from pve
ive spent the last few minutes trying to think of a idea worse than the ops ive come up with letting all t1 frigates fit doomsdays but even thats not coming close
what are you a communist if a man works harder then another man he should be rewarded they both should not recieve the same reward you mean people would have to actually play the game ugg how horrible but yes it would force people to spend more time playing the game ohnoeshow do you see that it would still allow training under the existing model however it would reward the guy who does more of everything i dont think it is mandatory i think in the future it would allow you to choose what you want to do when getting online ie do i wanna mine or pew pew because i have the sp for both and am no a longer 1 specfic trade charactor yes that is the point entirely have you been to the second moon of planet 3 in jita no one has the point of the whole argument is to force players to explore their mmorpg universe and reward those who have gone further or pew pewd more than the guy who has done less
wow that sounds like wow world of warcrafter yeahme thumbs down
bah are you serious wow does that i was trying to add a little bit of enb to eve not copy that wow crap
lol what are you the people that play more get more iskyuck why would i want to be forced to do silly grinds or do crap i dont like just to get sp no thanks i have had my share of that crap in wow and other such grindathons
bah are you serious wow does that i was trying to add a little bit of enb to eve not copy that wow crapthen you should gb2enb  o p
that would ruin eve op its a bad idea go rethink your stuff
op is obvious troll
then you should gb2enb  o puhhwhat does gb2enb  o p mean
uhhwhat does gb2enb  o p meanlolahem go back to earth and beyond
could you respond in english or perhaps drunkn english please i may not be up on all the hiphappin sayings of todays youths with your trolls flames blogs and zimas but i dont think that qualifies as a supportive or opposing statement reguarding the discussion at hand
lolahem go back to earth and beyond thx for the clarification enb is gone  eve is here and i think it is a wonderful game with a number of possible improvements that wouldcould make it better i feel this should be one of them
hes saying that even you dont believe what youre saying and that you only proposed it because you found it funny to annoy us and after reading your last post i concur with him
well so be it thats a trickly little thing to do now isnt it if i say no im serious then i am being more of a troll or if i say oh well you found me out then i am just being honest right so either way i am full of it because i have nothing better to do atm then argue about arguing rightwell here is a thoughtif the previous posts were in some way distasteful or annoying perhaps you would move to a different forum section why take the time to post a reply if you think i am full of it
skill training benifted from the ability to train if your account was suspended not any more
thx for the clarification enb is gone  eve is here and i think it is a wonderful game with a number of possible improvements that wouldcould make it better i feel this should be one of themwhat you feel and what is rational are 2 different things
not that that is a good or bad idea but this is an industry thread not a mission or high sec in general thread did i miss something in your post
since ccp stop the ghost training prog we would suggest that to enable 3 characters in 1 acct to be train togetherso we can still transfer our active acct to an another active acct when one is off for long session of training youdont expect us to maintain 20 accts for 1 whole year dont youi would like to have your vote on this thanks and best regards to you allps we all love eve onlinehope ccp will love us all
if you want 20 active and skilling characters that is exactly what i would expect you to do however i cant even understand the urge to have more than 1 or 2 secondary charactersand the game doesnt cost a fortune anyway if the game is such an important and dominant part of your life that you need to manage a whole private army of characters to play it it should still be worth the money actually even more so just think what a partner a pet or any other hobby would cost instead however i support the basic point of your suggestion which as far as i understand it is multiple skilling character slots per account not just as is though i think ccp should just remove the 3 characters limit from the accounts and instead make it as many alts as you want with each alt beyond 2 and each skill slot beyond 1 costing extra let the players chose how much they need in one account if they prefer
my view on this 1 character in training  full speed 2 characters  each progresses at half speed 3 characters  each progresses at 13rd the speedif you want two characters to progress at full speed you need two accounts and yes more slots on the account would be nice a cap of 5 instead of 3 should do
well im against the ghost training nerf as it stops people doing stupidly large skills while not payinghow ever to equalize this i think that all other things should be stopped ie researchingi think this may keep most people happy whule not giving a huge advantage to inactive accountsthere are only so many skills that would be worth training while inactive and aslong as the people are only allowed to train 1 skill while inactive they wont stay inactive for to long
when i started playing eve which was not so long ago there was one thing that immediately bothered me it kept bothering me still does and with more and more knowledge on how the game works it seems just plain wrong to methe issue is the transition from empire highsec to 00or to be more precise there is practically nonefor all that matters lowsec is completely misnamed because there is no relevant sec that could be low lowsec is nosec and in many aspects just like 00 in some points it is even worse because the borderline is defined so clearly making easily campablewhat i suggest is a more fluent transition between the two and to achieve that i suggest the addition of active npc fleetsflotillaslowsec is still empire owned by an empire faction and theoretically patrolled by that faction not frequently but still patrolled what else guarantees the empire factions system sovereignty if they wouldnt care the least bit what happens therepractically it isntso add military and concord combat groups that patrol the systems from highsec to lowsec from 10 where a small group of 12 fleet cruisers or 2 frigates will be enough to 01 where it will more likely be 12 battleships with escort on the other hand however the frequency of patrols should be the other way around the higher the security rating the more frequent the proportionally weak patrolso in highsec we would frequently see a few small military vessels that take tours around the system jumping from belt to belt planet to planet gate to gate station to station and so on engaging and destroying any reds they encounter any pc and npc reds alike of course so it might happen that a fleet patrol comes to a belt and kills the beltrats therein lowsec the combat groups would be larger as mentioned but there would be fewer of them that would make less thorough tours of the systems especially there would not be combat groups for each system but instead constellation combat groups that would prefer higher lowsec systems over the lowerin addition to that these fleets would take the role of concord in lowsec but without instant appearance instead in cases where normalle concord would spawn these combat fleets would actually have to move there from whereever they were at the moment even if it is two systems awaywhat i think this would bring to eve is this1 better game world immersion due to visibly active nps factions2 blurred borders and less gate camping making high lowsec actually safer than 00 borderline and 003 cat  mouse thrills for pirates whod actually have to evade the armed forces4 more highsec players would dare venturing into the higher lowsecs thus blurring the border even more and acting as fear therapy for paranoid carebears eventually it would encourage more players to leave the safe havens eventually5 more uncertainty players could not easily predict how safe it is to operate in any given lowsec system both nonpirates and pirates6 a low risk of minor additional lag factors i dont think that a handful of npc ships operating in a system can be that relevant though each highsec gate is camped by navy ships already7 captains attacked in lowsec would at least have a faint hope of getting rescued which would also encourage pirates to work fast and stay alertpirates could still engage in piracy but like pirates and not like african warlords lowsec would be clearly different from 00 more risky for some safer for others and all in all more turbulent diverse and thrillinglast but not least these combat groups would not even have to automatically engage and fight anything and anyone that is hostile the first thing they could do is demand an immediate end of hostilities if the pirates withdraw no shots need to be fired also adds immersion and game world credibilityopinions please
well id halt short of calling them whiners although they definitely border this the problem is it is a huge misconception that wrecks  loot it is not loot i saw in an old thread where ccp prism made some good comments on the subject empire space he said whether a mission spawned ds pocket or otherwise belongs to empire thus probing and entering this space is not intrusive to the mission runner second another player in the same thread mentioned other mmos while tryign to avoid equating anything to any specific other ill still use the common knowledge of wow since a larger percentage seems to have this experience to make the point if you kill a creature in wow you and only you may loot it however if i come along with the skills to skin the creature i can skin it what is left behind is the loot bag with your loot still in it this is strangely similar to eves method all except in one way rats in missions are not in the commonly accessible area of the world as in wow you can run by and often see people killing things in open areas however this is a misconception missions are run in commonly accessible areas you just need probes to find them the earlier statement by prism stating that empire space is owned by empire makes this clear it is no different than happening upon someone by walking by them slaughtering a tiger and skinning the kill for yourself with no repercussions as to probing a mission runner down and salvaging the wrecks from that which hes killed ive played eve for a long time i was here during the closed beta when we didnt even have autopilot and had to use a third party app to find the route in which would take us where we wished to go probes werent around and when you killed something it died into a can the loot tables have not changed much in the last five years if anything theyve gotten better people routinely make the statement that we are cutting into their profits of their missioning the problem with their assumption here is 2 fold 1 its their profits to be had and 2 that it is really a large portion an example here if i come across an empty mission after theyve completed it ill loot everything as well everything ranging from lots of 100mn mwds 800k isk and meta 0t14 1600mm plates 3002mil isk and tons of various high end weapons in 2 missions i gathered 7 prototype auto cannons alone around 78 mil total the total salvage from 1 mission is pretty high but hardly a majority even if it was a large portion before salvage no one complained salvage was not added to benefit you as missions runners it was added completely seperate to this so your complaints are invalid mission runners do little but run missions drinking from a stream of endless isk sure those of us who salvage i hate the term ninja salvage as it is some what pejorative and in truth true salvaging involves hunting down those wrecks to salvage whether another killed them they crashed on their own or whatever did not kill the wrecks but this doesnt matter this is what we do continue your missions but seriously stop trying to have cake and eat it tooin conclusion ccp has forced this method upon us we cannot probe down wrecks but only those running them given this weve little choice as pure salvagers not missioner salvagers but to do this given this there is but one and only one assumption salvaging as a viable occupation must and only must include salvaging others wrecks
since this thread got bumped im totally laying down my stance px the ninja salvager should be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because the mission runner owns the wrecks and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamic
i think the idea was to express why not just your choice
i have very little to say but it is the biggest stfu to you whining ninnies you do not have to train learning skillssorry for the cruise control but you dont when you train learnings you dont actually lose time so to say lets pretend with hypothetical skills you have lvl 2 in advanced learning logic for this example and you have skill x at 4 to go to 5 it actually saves you time to get logic up one point this may take 7 hour but it saves you a total of 12and so you actually have saved 5 hours how this is a time sink i do not knowwhat i do know is that i never straight trained any learning skill i simply trained it when the numbers added up to me saving time by spending 8 hours training a skill to save 15 hours of training anotherits all how you look at it stop complaining these skills have been here since day one youve not dont come in crying because weve already trained them and youve yet to
hello againi ran the first time ended up an alt although that didnt seem to make much difference as i seem to be attendingvoting in most meetings atm and i thought id throw my hat in for round 2my csm blog will be updated shortly but for the most part ill try to keep doing what i already am voting for or against things i think are good or bad for the playersgame finding interesting things to promote generating discussion and staying up to ridiculous hours of the morning

updated the op for the rescheduled meeting
i dont know if the csm are aware but ccp already plan a redone of citadel torpedo hp vulnerability thing i thought i would save you csm the trouble of going over itlink to ccp post
stop wait wait i figured out where im failing to answer your questions and how to answer themyoure saying that because wealth in 00 available resources is a zerosum game i cant give the small alliances anything without taking from the large however im talking about boosting the income of 00 overall so its there are more resources available and its no longer a zerosum game why yes i support opening the treasure chest to allas far as the zerosum of sov i hope that the new sov tool and fast routes to income would together increase the volatility of assets resulting in more power passing through more hands in that sense its definite that im proposing taking sov from the haves and making it readily attainable dont landmine me to the havenots to address this obvious unfair redistribution the value of stable sov will be increased a great deal and sov will be made more meaningful by a shift from spacesticks based sov rewards to spacebling basedas far as entropy the reaction barrier via the pos is very high entropy would favor the disorganization of power more is better favors the conglomeration of power the only way large multicellular organisms fight entropy is by increasing entropy outside the system that is in order to maintain power to prevent the steady erosion towards disorder you have to be consuming energyin eve the energy level of a system can be modeled as a reaction diagram the energy state of organized power should be higher relative to lower states of organization however because the mechanism of power transfer to lower organizational states has a much higher activation energy relative than the activation energy for transfer from organized to organized most power transfers are from one organized alliance to anotherin this model raising the volatility means lowering the activation energy of power and wealth transfers to lower organization states resulting in a higher rates of transfersecond issue is that the pos acts like a molecular ratchet a molecule which stores the random energy and to an extent defies entropy when a molecular ratchet stores energy it holds onto it in a higher energy state that is quite stable only because it blocks the reverse reaction pathway something that shouldnt happen according to second law of thermo and microreversibility principle when a pos is placed by a large alliance its much like this molecular ratchet in that it is the result of a fairly minor sov conflict but is now in a higher energy state that cant go through the reverse pathway thus breaking the reverse reaction this creates a situation where a relatively easy reaction is turned into a nearly impossible reverse reaction equilibrium thus occurs far away from where the reality of energy states would have it occursov entropy is broken in eve because of how the pos prevents the reverse reaction in some cases ship entropy in sov warfare is broken in eve because of carrier circlejerks manufacturing armor and shields from thin air but thats an entirely different matterthe 20 question is how to break the molecular rachet and let the reaction loose i surmise that the mechanism of this rachet requires opportunities for organization on the part of organized powers and that increasing the volatility will give them less time to respond and take away their size advantage by forcing them disperse or nullify it by reacting before the ratchet mechanism can take placethermodynamics level iv 135765 sp
no that is not what i am saying i am saying that power is a zerosum game increasing everyones wealth doesnt do anything to the system entrenched alliances still hold the power you have to necessarily decide that you are going to intentionally alter the power balance of 00 if you want to advantage start up organizations you have failed to make this acknowledgment and because of it your ideas fail they fail to produce your goal since your goal is impossible and they fail to produce a better power balance for eve since they arent aimed at the problempeople are not unintelligent logical operators without goal your description thus has nothing to do with anything as it actually pertains to the game even if it was not your theorywhich is wrong would state that removal of pos would bring about an equilibrium state faster which is bad
power if affected by the total amount of players and activity in 00 will also increase and then neither is power a zerosum game existing 00 alliances might absorb a lot of the new elements or may face dilution overall thats up to the dynamics of the gamethe volition choices needs and capabilities of people are conceptually compatible with the models used to understand and predict the behavior of molecules that have reaction kinetics affinities reaction sites and multiple equilibria and major and minor products anyone who takes enough chemistry courses eventually runs into at least one professor who uses analogous human contexts to explain the complexities of chemical relations ill bet you 2 isk someone somewhere has used game theory to describe chemical systems of some kind in that respect game theory can probably likewise be modeled as cases of chemical systems the concepts are without a doubt more similar than they are dissimilarremoval of the pos isnt a goal if that happened it would be more comparable to removing a whole class of chemicals and their interactions repairing the reversereaction mechanism would be a goal that involves lowering hp and stront timers or adding more granular mechanisms at the pos the multigrid solution achieves the latter by giving an outnumbered alliance the alternative goal of harassing detached forces defensive or offensive while remaining mobile and writing off the tower as an acceptable loss or impossible objective
ellie your missing the point deari use to play wow god that game consumed 2 years of my life so i left it in look of something more challenging and viola found evei like the pvp and yes while i fly frieght on this char i have a up and coming pirate on an alt which i enjoy as wellmy point is that yes praying on the weak is fun at times it would be nice if those weaklings had a better way of calling in help thats alli dont play my hauler when i want to pve i expect every time i go into lowsec to be pirated and only haulers and pve players who dont expect that whine im not one of them you catch me in lowsec and pod or ransom me well thats just tuff luck im not gunna run off crying and play another game there will always be people alot bigger than me in this game fact of lifeso no i wont go back and play wow and no just because i have a hauler doesnt mean im a carebear those who choose hauling dont always dislike pvp but you only ever hear of the ones that winge and moan
my two cents on pvp in evepvp in eve doesnt happen when the ships are fireing at each other pvp in eve is all done before that pvp is mostly intelligence gathering what ships where backup who the best plan always wins the worst plan always looses going in with the wrong ships and numbers against a enemy will get you killed vica versa you say someone got ganked in a noncombat ship well they had the tools to avoid getting ganked so boo fricking hoo they deserved to loose their ship because they didnt pay attention
5 to 7 times out of 10 most of those people dont know how to go about thatand no one bothers to tell them other than grining and parading around killmails
remove titans from game problem solved
thats stupid not only is that an easy way to lose your characters but skill training is hardly something that requires a lot of time youd spend more time coding the macro than you would just managing the skills
ill assume for a moment you have zero experience in any sort of coding for large software projects yes it is a long ordeal to get things written working and in a good form scripts i can write a web interfacing vote bot or a cute little aim bot or as youve said a skill training bot that uses web based skill changing in less than 1015 minutes for a web based authentication and changing of a skill it would consist of about 50 lines of perl script the majority of that script being generic support for the modules used for web interfacing lwp and simple routines for reading a skill plan file and changing the skill at the correct time itd be simple it would happen its fine as it is as for losing characters people dont lose characters that often selling them on ebay the buyer may lose them but the seller he gets paid he can afford his accounts using isk farmed from a farming account buying gtcsbad idea skill training is fine as it is remaining so will be no complaints from meas for the original post im confused as to what the patch has caused problem wise it does but one thing stops people from advancing whilst the account is unpaid fine by me if you play any other mmo where you grind for skillxp as we do massive amounts of isk here you cannot cancel subs and continue to level up why would you expect ccp to allow the same ridiculous notion my friend ccp does well in my opinion some of the best customer interaction and shifting their game play to the majorities needs unlike any other experience in any mmo ive played eve has come a long way since the first time i played in closed beta didnt even have autopilot thank goodness for whomever had coded that everoutefinder ccp deserves every cent they make as i truly feel the majority of that goes back into development of a good game there is still some rough edges to polish but the fact it inconveniences you that you dont skill up while on an unpaid account is not part of what needs to be polished
sorry herschel but youd think differently when you take into account that in this day and age no one gives a damn about how much timeall it takes is one guy to do it then sell off the scriptmacroideaproduct legally or illegally and now its very quick and easy to implementi would have thought you would have figured that out by now o in the age of computers it gets easier all the time just a question of motivation and will powerjoe gamer may not have skills or time but they do have the motivation and will to find a way and find a way they willoh and i do have programming experience i would guess its safe to assume you dontdont get me wrong tho great feature id love it but its potential for abuse is a bit high so if a way can be engineered to prevent that kind of thing from happening im all earsand all thumbs upotherwise badbad idea
i smell an uber geekme appluads
i dont have a vast amount of programming experience but i am well aware that scripts are very easy to make i know it wouldnt literally take longer to make the script i intended that phrase as a commentary on how little time skillswapping takes that said i just ran the numbers on what skilling up a character for sale will get you and its surprisingly little  depending on how you choose to count herschel would fetch me a profit of 14 billion after costs which at gtc prices is 70280 assuming you can get cash at the same rate as you get isk from gtcs thats less than 1 per skill swap which is hardly worth it for some actively trying to make money but its more than enough to justify macroing i cant imagine ccp puts up with ebaying of characters  its way way too easy to spot and shut down either at the level of nuking the character or at the level of petitioning ebay to take it down  but assuming it was possible i would actually almost expect to see this as an issue it appears my point may have been made in error  it depends a lot on what numbers you use because there arent hard and fast prices for a lot of this but there may well be a market to be had in character farming of course this raises the question of why this isnt done already is there some reason this macro wouldnt work right now yes ccp just closed the profit margins somewhat but theres still money to be made you just said how easy it is to make and distribute this macro so why cant we assume that everyone who would do this is doing it already the topic at hand here is a skill queue and if a skill macro is so trivial wheres the harm in ccp doing it for us anyone who wants to use one for profit already has a reason to youre just giving the same capability to those of us who want to use it for fun
i suppose you got a valid point therebut also keep in mind that ebay as well known as it is isnt the only form of selling your accountsive already met 1 who obviously bought his no proof but everyone seems to think so for rather strong reasonseven then its not really my business to point fingers on something you cant provebut it can be doneand likely will be the case for many months to come if not yearsi guess what im trying to get at is this would potentially make it easier to exploit thatbut if there where safeguards in place or some sort of ccp approves this method and regulates it then i dont have a problem with itbut after some thought in light of what you brought up id have to take a step back and think about it
no waythats an interesting idea so what would you get from the sonar just a bearing
i think it was largely a cash grab but i also think theres nothing we can do about it  any company that lets the customers dictate the price is a company soon to be enacting the something for nothing business model if you dont like the price stop paying it not my preferred situation but not one im going to argue my way out of either
standingsissue stuck faction standingsthx 
when it comes to the minnie caps we are def unbalancedin need of love op is spot on and i support his conclusions
im for ghost training as long as they give you 10 of the normal sp you would normally getit was never an advertised feature of the game its listed in one place and only one place on the ccp site and put in a place that people are more than likely to neglectwhen you can find a ccp ad that says you can train while your character is unsubscribed then you can say they advertised it the point of an advertisement is to draw players into the game just because you may have used it as a reason to draw people in doesnt mean ccp advertised it i have yet to see any ccp ad getting new players to join the game because of ghost training
signed
never used it but i like the option for when i go on holidays ect
agreed
whichever csm brings back ghost training has my vote
i firmly believe ghost training should remain not only because it is a unique and outstanding feature but also because ccp should know that respect can be so easily lost with a single blog or the hiding of a thread and by maintaining what was once documented as a game feature they can at least salvage some dignity not to mention accounts
worthless change
ccp need to rethink this
5 years and it comes to this
ccp has to rethink the ghost training part  it was the main reason why i ve started with eve no jokewithout it it just looks like ccp tries to bind the player with long skilltrianing times as long as they can a cheap trick to get as much money as possible from each customerall accounts canceled till ghost training is back
signed
you dont pay you dont get its clear
wasnt the csm founded to make this kind of things more transparentccp clearly lost the connection with the player base not because they disable ghost training but how they handeld italso shame on them to hide the thread about ghost training or being extremly incompetentsigned
ccp shoot himself by doing this change and retire the motivation for players to come back from a breakccp need to make some official and serious excuses about the way that this move was done as i dont appreciate how ccp treated his customers this timeand restore ghost training but why not with a limitation of 2 or 3 weeks as i can understand that this feature could permit some abusesthis would be a good compromise

signeddetails in the devblog comments thread here
o i was just about to put that in so any way lets add about say5000 votes plusalso add all the people that dont use the forums say another 5000 votes 
o and have they actualy done it cos there hasnt been a patch unless its sever side only
i dont ghost train and still think this is the dumbest move ever and the way ccp handled the whole thing was pure kamikaze dye well ccp ill be here until tq goes down though doing my thing on 1 account only of courseoh and the 133 page and counting thread on information portal is still hidden how much lower can you get ccp
understandable that ccp wants to make more money but please say so and not make up a bull sht story about it 
this will end up costing ccp more in the long run
i could accept an end to ghost training if better notice was given say at least 2 months from announcement to the removal of the feature and if we were given a skill queuei was further upset by the abrupt removal of ghost training due to the lies and excuses that ccp pumped out to cover it
bad move ccp i never once heard anyone in any chat complain about ghost training this was one of the great features of eve and what the people complaining now dont seem to see is that yes the characters are inactive or unsubbed but they still get brought back online to change the skill meaning you still have to pay to train this is going to hurt ccps bank account more than us as players
signed wtf ccpgot enough of those pesky subscribers
more warning would have been nice but really just posting to show how awesomely useless csm is it seems people have forgotten
man first removing the choice of different gtcs and with it driving the price per month up by some 3040 and now thisgreat going ccp can i has more of your marketing bulle to explain why you are ripping us off pls i was thinking of getting a third account really but this change shot it right down
i vote nothis is a welcome change pay to play
so will csm take this issue to a vote on whether to reinstate ghost training
signed and supporting 
support
ccp wants to drive there company into the ground by screwing over there player base they would never try to make up for it by giving us something that has been needed for years no not ccp i have always supported this idea
definitley
yes please
the very least ccp can do now that its screwing over its playerbase by making multiaccount running more expensive
no nerf no nerf no nerf brings torch and pichforkno seriously a bit of fine tuning might be required tho
against the nerf if you can even call it a nerf ccp has taken small gang warfare chopped it up into little pieces with a chainsaw and set it on fire ccp you fail
after further consideration ive changed my position from my previously held  elsewhere stated opinion and so support the issue raised as it has been edited by serenity
abolutely
you arent going far enoughonce an account laspes it should stay paying impound fees on all items in all stations prolly make it equal to say 1 isk per m3 per day of laspethen you need to lose sp when you lapse because you know use it or lose it i would say 100k sp per day off of the highest sp skill firstthen your rp should just go away you unsubbed they dont know you anymore you shuold have to regrind all of your positive factions but keep your negativesfinally you should all sorry dont really care much about the loss of ghost training especially if we finally get a skill queue but all the whining about it has annoyed me
firm beleiver in pay to play not paying shouldnt equal an inflated wallet
i agree with this it should really have been considered by the gms when ghost training was on the board
yes and throw out chars who havent been subscribed for over a month damn those leeching database fillersit allways makes me laugh when companies claim stuff like this is stretching their hardware while the performancedollar ratio of that hardware doubles every 12 years storage bandwith and calculation power have never been cheaper and will continue to get cheaper pretty much forever yet ccp needs to nerf things like ghost training and up prices instead of laughing i should really be crying shouldnt i
when ecm ships got a boost they forgot to boost eccm modules to match the change now everywhere you go especially in low sec there is falcons everywhereit is simply not possible to roam in low sec in a small gang without brining your own falcon to jam their falcon this is just sillyeccm modules should get a much needed boost
but falcons are caldari nerfing caldari is not allowed ok
when did ecm ships get a boost was that about the same time as ecm got its strength reduced 50
entertainment ftw
alliance tourney  csmif its a budget issue then its a nobrainer  the first is worth the money the second isnt that is all
yes
yes please
yey
support from the initiative
thumbs up from meneeds moar evetv tbh
yes and support evetv while you are at it duh
evetv is dead get over itas for the alliance tournament sure bring it back
id like to know why ccp thought we might not want it back i was starting to wonder what was taking so long to announce the next one
cos they cancelled them
yes
yea defo
yes
oh yes
one of the things that infuriated me about the alliance tournament was the way the commentators talked about billions of isk like it was nothing perhaps thats why today we have devs balancing the game around snake sets and t2 rigs
with rules that arent stupid and reward luck
has my support the alliance tournament is always a great thing to watch and talk about for weeks before and after its been and gone
billions of isk is nothing to an alliance it is a lot for a character 1 significant amount for most corps and petty cash for the biggest alliances you seriously think an alliance feilding multiple 60 bil titans is going to think even 5 bil a horrendous blownow yeah a bil is tons for the rest of us my total net worth for me and the wife after almost 15 years together is likely under 5 billion net worth includes all assets my wallet is under 10m
def need this its one of the things ya just have to watch
i always enjoyed watching these as did many other players fully supported
look this is a really simple issuewe have some truely great thirdparty tools that interacts with the api overall the api is fairly decent however theres some which we need to truely make the api usablea contracts apitheres a disconnect in the data which you can get from the api at present filling in an api for contracts would fill most if not all of this gapso heres a request for ccp to finally add one of the missing things from the api please make the api truely useful and wonderful
signed
sounds good
i personally would like also like a blog about the statusdirection the api is heading in
i drool a little too heavily at the thought of going from 27msp to 54msp that would let me finish so many skills that i want to train on the other hand the 70msp player going to 140msp has me about to wet myself every titan to v
stadshage  i can solo all lvl4 missions and do lvl5 missions often getting boring my alt flys a hulk totally boring pvp i dont like as i dont see ganking noobs or using the mob mentality ftw fun
hell noyou gain the bulk of your characters abilities very rapidly maxing skills out is the preserve of a veteran pilot think about it at lvl 5 your character reaches the peak of his abilities in that skill he can ever get any better at it that should be an achievement and not one that comes easily eve is meant to be played for years not months there are meant to be goals to achieve ahead of you and the most powerful craft and equipment is the preserve of the veteran pilot  if it isnt then what will you have left to aim for after two years of playing why should everyone be flying elite battleships they would no longer be elite
i dont have 70mill sps and let me tell you if i had 50 more i could probably max out on pretty much every capital ship skill then what am i aiming for then what is the point of training
while i disagree with the ghost training nerf business im starting to get sick of the serious case of stupids which has swept the forum of latejust because youre waiting for a skill to trainit does not mean you cant keep playing the game while your skill is trainingif you want some quick gratification try jerking off as things are if you dont think it is worth paying money for to train it then dont train it i only ever liked ghost training because i respected the fact that in the hit by the no 3 bus to cheswick style scenario i could have a character train while unfortunate external events prevented me from playing now hopefully this can be locked
qft
smartbombs have limited range for good reasons you should not be able to hotdrop a carrier and uber smartbomb everything smaller than a battlecruiser within what 1520km of your shipfighters and drones along with most frigates would be rendered utterly useless by a smartbomb with extended range and damage that can instapop them outside of their engagement range especially as it would be a t1 mod built from a bpo which makes it highly affordabledictor spheres would be renderred pretty much obsolete as the dictor would not be able to drop a sphere outside of smartbomb rangeif you want that kind of power on one ship then you have top pay the premiums either on factionofficer loot or on a titan capital ships should not be solo pwn mobiles and this would be tipping the odds too far in a capital ships favouri do fly them and this would not be good for game balance
this is an idiotic change with no rationale aside from i want a rly big big smartbomb because capital pilots want one which i at least dont find particularly compelling there are many reasons to not implement a larger smartbomb among them the fact that tacklers are already at a disadvantage against capital ships due to heavy energy neutralizers and drones and the fact that easily available faction smartbombs can hit out to warp scrambler range not that anyone uses those but still capital ships already have extremely potent defensive and offensive capabilities and in the case of carriers have effectively no limitations or downsides giving them an additional offensive module would be idiotic
i have been running l4 missions for almost a year now and i have yet to shoot a tier 3 battleship why are these ships missing from missions are the npc pirate factions too poor to purchase these ships or is ccp too lazy to program themi move to rework missions to add tier 3 battleships to the list of targetseditadd tier 2 bc to the list of ships to be worked inadd more variety to the ships seen in missions
i am not sure how much being lazy has anything to do with why a certain tier ship isnt in missions i do like the idea of shooting something besides the same ships over and over again eve has over 300 ships in it save seeing capitals in lvl 4s i wouldnt be opposed to a larger cross section of ships added to the npc pirates
yes and tier 2 drakes too and myrdmidons absolutions and you know we need them much
realistically we are talking about a culture that is essentially far superior to our current irl i imagine a few tweaks to the ole mail box should be supported seeing as how its 2008 and even microsoft has this one figured out
i suggested this as a useful feature in the last ccpcsm meeting the csm supported it and ccp acknowledged it changes to mail system are being looked at in the very near futuretake carearithron
i suport the idea but have a realy hard felling lets do a background chek we whanted nanos nerfed first nerf when domis wore going 8 kmsecthey changed it to curent sistem we whanted more nerf we are getting abs better then mwdso as a great man spoken no battle plan ever survises contact with the enamy so do i say no nerf plan ever survises with ccpif they will nerf it it will be nerfed so hard u wont be able to find ure corp mate if u are 1 au from him nerf it but do it gentle
silly whiners this isnt a big deal if you need 8 active accounts to feel happy you have other bigger issues you need to sort out than the fact that you cant pay for them it was a nice feature now its gone its not a big deal now start redoing the bloody ui p
now let me get this straight are you implying that ccp announced that they are disabling the skill training when your character is not online or are they disabling the ghost training for inactive accountsim pretty sure that its the latter and your incoherent rambling and disaster prediction is not only uncalled for but also a strong indication that you are trolling or unable to grasp realitythe categories of people you are mentioning are not able to play 23x7  i am a member of the afore mentioned groups not a student and my workload keeps increasing steadily i cant be online every day not to mention for prolonged periodsstill i am able to afford and pay for the account i own and i could easily afford a second but dont want too which gives me the right to enjoy the services ccp offers one of them is being able to train my skills while i am not playing the gamei cant understand why someone who is not paying for an account should enjoy the same services as a paying customer doesif there are people who would not reactivate their accounts because they cant finish training a skill while they dont pay their sub i can safely assume that they dont like the game either they are just in here for playing with new toys only until they get bored of them to these people i wish good luck on their next game and would ask them to contract to me their stuff
they hunt whales end of story
fixed for you d i have used it transfering my alt and the wifes alt from trial to full account it makes me less angry when i miss a skill change cause i can go hey i already got 2 weeks for free
i am in full support of ccps decision to get rid of ghost training personally it speaks to players trying to extend beyond their means imo if i can only afford one character to train then thats my own financial issue its their game we just pay to play itmy heart goes out to the individials whom have been effected by the latest financial crisis and i pray for your families to continue to have food and a roof over their headsinternet space ships is serious business just not irl
well ppl start whining cause this is the 2nd time in a matter of months that they make eve cost more first the gtc price raise and now this these changes are hurting the hard core multiaccount players bad and in the end those are the players that make eve an interesting game and provide a lot of ccps income i hope for their sake they did not shoot themselves in the foot with these 2 measures
any players quitting because of this wont be missed or even noticed since they obviously dont have their accounts active anyhow
i honestly dont get what the hell the problem isif your so upset then stop playingmoney talks not whinersif they see a major drop off in subscriptions then you will get there attentionno ones forcing you to pay for something you dont likeso leave already and let the rest of us brainwashed folk continue playing the game
theyre miniature combat recons not miniature force recons combat recons cant be bo bridged
this needs to be implemented fast bloody outrage this hasnt been done sooner

while i appreciate that people like this idea i disagree with it eve has always demanded the element of trust be required in cooperative operations and this proposed change would act to remove that requirement in an important area of application
heyhas any candidate been pushing for a redo of the overview and uiim ready to vote for the one that promise to scramble and web some devs until they promise to fix the crap p
nobody has come out on that platform yet but very few candidates have announced thus far im quite sure somebody will run for the csm with the ui as a major part of their platform pretty soon though
why is it we have a check box allowing us to support a csm suggestion but no option to reject the proposalgive us a thumbs down button
this has been posted several times before  please use the existing old thread here or the smaller but newer thread here
this was the original thread over at the features and ideas sectionthanks to inactivity locked by now the main problem is that it is possible to lock yourself out of the chance to ever fly a mission again for specific factions more detailsinfodiscussion in the originallocked threadi would like to encourage anyone to revive this problem because i think its an issue that contradicts the principle that eve stands for
make a friend run an l1 mission for a corp of the opposing faction turn in for gang you now have standings with that corp and can get storylines again after completing 16 missions just like everyone elsebefore you  every other faction why not start and fail a mission for 1 corp of everybody then train diplomacy 1 and you have positive corp standings againthe only ones this doesnt work on are the pirate corps where you can rat the corp standing to nothing and mission the faction standing to nothing then you have to get personal standing with 1 specific agent and use that agent forever until your corp and faction can be rebuilt join a corp with good standings for a few dayswith it using the highest of personal standing with agent corp or faction or corp standing with agent corp or faction there are plenty of ways to get out of the hole it will likely take longer to recover than to screw yourself though
if you screw your faction standings good enough you wont be able to fly for any corpagent of that faction even if you have 10 corp standing a 2 faction standing after adjustment with diplomacy will prevent you from doing anything for that corpthe only chance is to get derived faction standings  but as is already stated in the linked thread if you would care to read  at least for some factions its quite easy to lock yourself out completelyand ofc the fact that killing structures  ships of npc factions will drop the according standings without getting whatever increase in standings with hostile factions just adds to the problem
you had the perfect ship for the job and you put it in low sec only where it now sits at a pos compressing ore or used as a hauler what a sad end for a great idea used in empire it would have been the centerpiece of mining operations and provided a way for meduim sized corps to dip their toes in low sec with out the full blown time commitmant of a pos also would have been used for exploration ie grav siteswould also have encouraged low sec ninja mining on a corp scale subject to been able to cyno back to hi sec space
well the orca is going to be a cap ship likely like the freighter that can use gates because i dont see what purpose a second a second jump capable ore capital would serve but mehheres to having to go spend the billion isk on cap ship skill books still it was a significant part of the barrier to entry i really hope these minifreighters dont take more than 500m in books
id really like to see more specialized transport shipsstrontium haulers race specific isotope haulers mineral haulers and so forth would make hauling a bit more interesting without destroying logistical difficulties even more like jbs and jfs have
definitely an area i would like to see some development on its one of my aims in the next csm in fact communication is always good as it prevents misunderstandings and mistrusttake carearithron
clicky buttan
i dont know if this is a good idea or what effect would it have on other players but i would use this feature if rl kicks in beeing a freelance programmer i never know when ill get to work on an urgent project so you have my vote
i cant imagine ccp could support this as a business model and i dont want to think of what itd do to the character market im not convinced its a good idea and i am convinced it wont be used the way you want it to be
suggested this myself elsewhere but no longer in favor of it after i realized how it would make the job for character farmers only easier
this would be used as a tool for training capital ship alts on the cheap id rather people use isk to buy gtc to play if they cant afford the sub then they at least can still login for some gameplay when they arent grinding for isk to pay for the next gtc this is afterall what the gtc system was intended for also if your wallet is so tight then you cant afford to continue subscribing then you probably cant afford the reduced fee either it would be false economy
1 why is this such a bad thing it makes sense that if you can mine more than the other person and finish your cycle first that you get the resulting ore if the asteroid pops then that is just bad luck for the slower miner2 you can already clearly see who is mining which asteroid simply by observing mining laser activity i contest that it isnt a difficult thing to do 3 just because there is a message that an asteroid is already being mined doesnt mean someone has to pay it any attention or respect
first of all i dont expect a nonminer to understand at all but ill try to enlighten you regardless1 and 3 this has almost nothing to do with mining in public areas with random people you dont know i dont care who gets the ore first in those situations in fact i generally try to mine the same roid as somebody else if i dont know them simply because they are mining my roids and its a way of staking a claim this idea is intended for groups of people who are mining together and sharing the profits their 1 priority is to mine as much ore as possible in the shortest amount of time mining the same roid is counter productive if this is your goal2 of course you can see it you can see the laser you can see where its going what is usually not obvious is exactly which roid it is hitting youve got roids in front of it behind it above below and to each side depending on which way youre looking at it it could look like its hitting another roid in front of it and it is also difficult to locate the roid you want to mine in space using the overview you can locate which roid you want but you cant see if its already being mined my system completes the cycle easily pardon the pun using my system a small icon that is already available for enemies by simply looking at the overview you can select which roid you want and can easily tell if somebody is already mining it with just a little more effort the devs could make it so that you can tell who is mining it at a glance ie corp member group member or neutraland lastly why do you care so much not only is this a good idea but this is just one easily implementable addition in a sea of other additions did you see the last patch notes 90 of it was nitpicky stupid stuff and if you think this is a nitpicky stupid addition then 1 more wont hurt will it anything that makes mining easier is good for everybody
first of all try not to make assumptions about what other people do in eve  ill take a moment to enlighten youfor most of this year i mine on my industry alt most days im online because of limitations in my life placed on my ability to pay the due attention required for the kind of extensive 00 pvp i would otherwise be able to enjoy and as i used to do quite frequently mining is much less demanding on my resources so i can usually get away with it and with some success often i mine alone though im happy to say that sometimes i dont and the company has been very goodso i think i know what im talking about and i dont particularly care for your automatic why doesnt anyone understand me attitude based on absolutely nothing other than fobbing off what ive said even before youve begun to make a proper response to itnow if you read my second point again youll see that i clearly state that i can personally consistently tell which asteroid is already being mined though i see that you probably didnt understand what i said because what i meant conflicts with what youve gone on to say about what i said  i generally have no problem with working out which asteroid the beam is striking i dont have the difficulty with it that youve reportedi said that in my experience i can tell who is mining which asteroid simply by observing the mining laser activity  which means both watching for who is using the laser and where the laser is striking i still contest that it isnt a difficult thing to do perhaps im having a better graphical experience than some other players are in the case of a gang mining i would expect some form of gang communication to exist either in chat eve voice or an external equivalent of it  such as ventrilo therefore i wouldnt think it too difficult to believe it possible that when confusion in the gang arises about who is already mining which particular asteroid the most likely suspect could be quickly asked to describe the rocks theyre already mininganother idea that comes to mind is using a target painter as a laser pointer before asking for a whole ui change did you consider posting in or notice the features  ideas discussion forum before posting your unpolished concept hereyour main complaint is that the most sure way to avoid the problem is tedious welcome to eve tried to unanchor a large pos  numerous structures lately

having served as an alternate for an inactive alternate i am standing again for election to the csm for further details on my views agendas and character please visit my blogsitelinkage arithrons blogsitealternately why not read my latest interview conducted by sam guss at the excellent online ezine evemagcominterview at evemaga quick summary of my platformi will represent interact and consider supporting issues from any player regardless of nationality alliance corporation or sphere of playi will push for the csm to conduct themselves in professional way in dealings with players and ccp and for the csm discussions and meetings to be available as soon as possible for all players to view if they wish additionally i will be requesting that a more permanent and accessible record of past issues raised and meeting logs etc be developedi will push for better communication with ccp and from ccp and encourage ccp to be more forthcoming about changes with better warning periods giveni will interact and discuss or ask for elaboration of points issues and ideas with players on a regular nightly when possible basis i will support issues that i see as benefiting the majority of players regardless of how such issues impact on my ingame characters i will seek the advice and experience of other players if i do not have direct knowledge of any issue being discussedi am interested in making low sec more interesting and appealing having characters that choose to walk the path of evil crime and other dark pursuits get better content and opportunitiesi have no hidden agendas currently arithron is an industralistinventormissionerexplorermarketeer however i will not be specialising in issues from these spheres alone i will consider any issue and work at understanding the complexities before making a decision at a csm vote meetingfeel free to ask questions below and i will happily answer them to the best of my ability take carearithron
this is where i stopped reading think about what you said and get back to me when youve figured out where you went wrong
you cant tell me that a dinner table is a zerosum game and then bring out a thanksgiving feast the conditions for classifying it as a zerosum game become broken in the case of bringing more players and money to 00 neither power or money are zerosum games it will create a new zerosum game until things change again but locally its not zerosum and the conditions youre saying im under in crafting a solution arent going to hold non zerosum immediately implies that it is possible to raise the condition of large alliances and aspiring 00 playersalliancescorps at the same timethings wont change again until a new game is defined ie next patch
it depends on the game youre playing power is irrespective of what is on the table there are only so many seats and no action in the game can create more
youre going to have to elaborate on the mechanisms and behavior youre referring tothis is probably a halfhearted attempt at best but might be sufficient to give you an answer the new income system which sits below the sov level represents a large new body of power that can be held sov still exists above the system and gets its own boosts to value and meaningfulness if the volatility of the new asset is high enough it will exist in a power structure largely disconnected to sov mechanics only through economic relationships between those who have large amounts of planetary income and those who can use it will still exist whats to prevent an alliance from seeking both the infrastructure and the income volatility volatility fragments the big picture into a large number of smaller time domains where the more is better mechanic cannot operate
there are three tables a high sec table a lowsecand unconquerable 00 table and a 00 tableadding more food to the tables does not change the game because the game is defined by who is sitting at the tables giving something to both sides doesnt change power and power is the game and here is the crux of the issue the new asset you are devising uses the same sov mechanics to produce if you want to change the power balance the mechanism needs to advantage players who are there now as much as possible you have to incent individuals to go to the 00 space and stay there and if they get knocked out they need to have the incentive to come back passive income generation does not do that especially with the barrier to entry and production rate that you have proposedlarge organizations will not fail to pick the low hanging fruit and it will be low hangingbull more is better always holds true if you have 10 people and i have 20 then i can knock over and set up twice as many passive income generators but you have to worry about twice as many people coming and knocking over yours so not only can i do twice as much but my exposure is cut in half goodness why do you think alliances are created in the first place there is no way to get rid of this advantage it works for corporations in modern economies but that is because these organizations arent playing for power theyre playing for money when youre playing for money the fact that someone else is where you were and doing something that would not be totally efficient for you is ok you have an implicit agreement to stay out of each others way when youre playing for power destroying your opponents structure is easy and beneficial under your theory nations would never form and wars would never happen this simply isnt true
the crux is in fact the reason why large alliances can get by without worrying about the lowhanging fruit and having to put up with the high turnover rate of assets at the bottom of the food chain they can focus on their playing field and leave the circus to the carnies so to speak sure in systems where it makes sense they should exploit all they can but by and large if they have to run regular patrols of their territory because joe sixmangang can take out their infrastructure and replace it with his own in less than a day it wont be worth the effort and drain on manpowera new volatile asset would be akin to lowering the activation energy of 00 exposing everything to a higher number of potential reactions because a higher proportion of agents will have the necessary energy pilots gs largely can ignore the uncoordinated actions of many of the current elements in a context where that activation energy is low everyone can chip away at gs on that playing field and gs would be smart to avoid itthe issue isnt what 100 or 1000 pilots can do for all the pilots in the top three alliances there are many many more in losec and small alliances what lets a large organized entity like gs to operate is coordination smaller time scales would exacerbate logistics travel time and response window issues which would definitely hurt an organization like gs that depends on their coordination for efficient power projection this would be a large blow to an alliance like gs and thats why the infrastructure requirements for utilizing the new wealth should be placed in the hands of gs and co
this works as long as you cant shoot anyone since in eve you can shoot people your supposition fails and if you cant get them into 00 by shifting the balance of power then it wont matter you have to get them into 00 keep them in 00 as long as possible and make sure they come back if someone steps on them through this mix new organizations will be created and they can be big enough to challenge but your suggestions dont do that they dont do that because you are fundamentally ignoring the dynamics involvedyou are at this point just throwing out buzz words and hoping something sticks
funny i have the feeling im gaining more and more traction by focusing on the aspects of the solution that break the underlying assumptions necessary for the angle youre working to hold truegs can shoot people any large alliance can still shoot people and steamroll large swaths of territory any weekend of their choosing thats not going to change one bithowever like a forest fire the gss of the game will end up sweeping over the land to clear it out only to find life springing up in their wake in the current situation with poss as the smallest common denominator of 00 civilization the fire is more like a crown fire that wipes out the whole forest and leaves entire regions barren i still cant make as much money in geminate and its been months im having to recapitalize the mineral market all by myselfadd life at the bottom of the chain that can survive as the fire burns over them even if all thats left are ashes life will spring back quickly if all it takes is finding the right opportunity and stealing back a bunch of planets its immediately worth it to do so and much easier to survive the larger fires
and that is why power will not change you being able to put up passive production units would not change anything it would just mean that we would kill more things as we rolled through you need to remove the barrier to entry entirely you need to encourage people to be there the entire time otherwise there is no contraction in the amount of space that can be produced from and there is no increase in the amount of people that will be moving to 00 or at least not enough to matter
nah see way i see it getting to 00 and then having to grind your ass to the bone while trying to get some pvp victories with the yokals is a surefire recipe for falling behind on the war effort also by making the individual production overshadowed by the isk productivity through corp avenues will encourage the one thing that really will change the power balance more cooperationgrinding has the absolute opposite effect that you want people end up playing solo and macromining or macroratting tde4h looked less like humans that bots in ffxi income through grinding dissociates corps and alliances because everyone is out making money as fast as they can for the team effort but the best avenues are decidedly through the solo route via mining or rattingmore grinding and more mining will just lead to more solo miners and rattersa 25m asset that makes cash is a reason to go fight for a place in the sun or in the quiet expanses of some 120 au wide system you still have to get it out there you still have to go pick up the loot and get it to market or find ways to use it that promotes cooperation and teamwork assets that above all will change the landscape of 00
it doesnt have to be grinding you just have to ensure that the benefactors are online and active that they lose the benefit as soon as anyone pushes them out and they regain it as they get back into the spacethese barriers to entryas well as the logistics to make it all work will just make it another way for alliances to make money
press button is a mechanic i would agree to as im vehemently opposed to grinding and the feeling of playing asteroids with guristas and rogue drones id rather smack local in a hostile system than pretend that killing rats or asteroids is a gamei dont think you can compare an asset thats like playing tennis to the current pos situation poss are more expensive much harder to take down and dont particularly make a lot of money most barely paying for the gasnow a dyspro moon would be a good example of how an alliance can go out and rack up some passive income fast problem is what are the chances of a good moon not having a pos on it second what is the likelihood that an expensive moon wont mean a really hard fight third dyspro is expensive because of a near monopoly that was held for some time there just arent that many to go aroundproposed new structure would be much much cheaper require no fuel be easy to remove and all of them will make nearly the same incomethe move by ccp to have the whole moon mineral trade thing didnt work out the way they expected some moons became gold mines and most became cash sinks any proposed new system would have a mineral distribution not unlike some of the proposed fixes for moons on assembly hall much more even changing over time and much more diverse in this way while there will probably be some trade most planets would retain their relative valuethat is a much different playing field than the current situation on highend moons
yes and i am telling you its a bad idea its barrier to entry to too high and the passivity of it allows large alliances to exploit the same mechanic they do with moons
lets talk about numbers then1m100k hp shields100k hp armori was considering something that actually uses the production stream to finish construction of itselffor coolness and to explain the extremely high income for low initial investmentreinforcementif the tz whine wasnt there since this is an expendable asset and nobody is supposed to cry if it falls no reinforcement is fine by me either that or a much different type of reinforcement mechanic ie the device will activate a shield during the same window as its attacked for the next three days and will be vulnerable when that isnt up either that or let the defenders choose the time window of shieldresting something like that might have more promise than the current systemalthough timers lead to fights and fights are goodguns are a better mechanic for enforcing a minimum gang size that or multigrid solution which would beodd small sentries to protect from the roaming fast ships can be tanked by drakeat this point you can say im off in space without a clear direction
timers do lead to fights but only if there is a question as to whether or not who will win excuse me if i have the belief that most of the time the larger force will easily be able to win its an important mechanic when dealing with losing expensive physical and power based assets but beyond that its notmuch better than your previous numbers 1m isk is dirt cheap and 100k100k is roughly 300k ehp about as much as a heavily tanked rigged plated bsnow the only problem is how the resources get back to the owners a direct isk or asset injection is the best idea as unrealistic as that is without it then any placement is just going to be ping pong problem with the people dropping it losing it during their off time which means it wouldnt be valuable for anyone but an established group who would likely be able to keep it up
direct asset injection in the form of some kind of mineral formation or gas mixture that is pretty standardized no real high ends or low ends and all of them have a little bit of everythingvolume wise one industrial should be able to take a days pay otherwise it starts getting into the freighter problem and favors those with caps and the ability to protect themuse jump bridges etcno reinforcement mechanic would probably be a good thing kind of like handsoff mining do pvp things in the meantime and watch for those who would trash your basket scoop loot and just leave the thing there to weather the winds of 00 come back maybe its there no crying if it isnti dont think its that unrealistic its the perfect kind of tool for harvesting resources that would probably be developed in a real world situation if oil rigs had a 90 chance of blowing up they would be made out of cardboard and matar refuse just add nanotechnology and pretend they can finish their construction by themselvesraw materials can be taken to market so its fairly close to isk injection if you cant directly use the goods
well i would like throw my hat in the ring for the csmeveryone seems to ask opinions and such so here goesninja salvager i wouldnt do it but i do think its a profession in this game personally i would like either a compromise of something like a timer making wrecks in degraded wrecks which would be able to be tracked down with a specalized series of probes and launchers the degraded wrecks wouldhave no loot and 80100 of there salvage intactlownull sec issues my opinion on this is no matter how appealing ya make this some ppl just wont step outside the gates of high sec its not gonna happen i would love to see roaming gangs of killable concord floating around as bounty hunters or something interestingthe speed nerf i believe it was needed but approached wrongly instead of making one item counter another make it into a give and take aspect since the 2 pt scrams stop a mwd make it something like 2 points above the ships warp str will kill a mwd and in turn add some advanced warp stab mods and rig to reinforce the warp str allowing some players who still crave speed to sacrifice something to keep running like a bat outta hell i dont think nerfs should be straight up road blocks to steer the game but ya know theres some ppl that arent happy going less then ludicrous speed and should have the opportunity to work around the speed issueshigh sec issues ganking high sec ganking shouldnt have insurance payouts your insurance company wouldnt pay your claim if you total you car running from the cops after a heist i think if concord destroys your ship the insurance is voidlow sec if ya go into it ya know what to expect if ya dont youll find out damn fast my opinion on that im not throwing my hat in for corp or alliance agendas but i feel i would be an asset to csm and would like the chance to prove it

i am sorry you mean just because the guys who made you sign nda and paid for the trip to iceland said no or something along those lines there is nothing to discuss i think something lost in translation here man because there is plenty to discuss that is the whole point of csm to bring pressure on ccp on behalf of the community  no not walk away with the tail between ones legs you see what i have highlighted there well the response has been received month or more ago the discussion took place and yet you guys chose not to publish it why furthermore there has been way too much halftalk from csm about it you clearly guys have bad news to give to eve community from ccp and yet there was clear avoidance or appearance of avoidance on csm and ccps part when it comes to this issue what i predict is that ccp simply gave you guys the same brush off as they did us a year ago with it is too much trouble to implement and yet we have really proven them wrong in the original thread and since then they simply ignored it in my opinion this was and is the issue that 99 of eve community can get behind and yet we have musical instruments  does this not make you shudder does this not make you appalled does this not make you angry basically what i have gathered from ss and your responses is this you spoke with ccp and ccp told you to screw off and you guys were unable to come here and tell us outright so we can follow up with additional pressure on ccp for the first time in five years i am really upset at ccp at their covert attempts at manipulation of their mistakes and at continual subversion that they have exercised on many occasions it is definitely not the same company that made eve online in 2003 and are not the same people by not making even an effort to come out and talk to the community regarding the dead horse issue and by tying your csm hands when it come to clear concise and truthful account about your communications with ccp it proves to me that pretty much all is lost
because we had to have the ccpcsm discussions first then create the minutes have them approved by ccp and then have the community team post them anything else would be a breach of the nda we didnt chose not to publish it thats stupid to sayyou are basically telling me that the csm should not care about the nda and ruin the integrity that csm has because you want feedback from ccpim sorry but you are not being reasonable dont even get me started on the musical instruments in ambulation seriously i wish that they could just implement this but hey im not hilmarbut heres the dealwait till the minutes are out like everybody else who raised an issue or had interest in some of them the fact that you kept posting here and demanding an update gave you a bit congratz but you still have to wait for the minutes nobody on the csm is going to break their nda just because you want an updatebut thanks for proving to me that it was wrong of me to even give you an update on what was going on i dont think that going to happen in the future like this when people arent being perfectly reasonable but let me once again point out i would love to see this in game and im pretty sure we will some day
1 you do not see me being suspicious about the whole affair and demanding answers as reasonable especially since the ball was dropped once before for whatever reason and issue ignored or sent too late or what not2 lavista you did not give me an update specifically you did post for everyone that something has been received and we should wait if you read further ss actually said in so many words that it was useless since ccp gave definitive answer  from which anyone with modicum if intelligence can glean where it leads and what is going on then you came in and pretty much confirmed that yea we could talk about i but why since ccp already told us  the only reason i received replies from you guys is because i am a pushy bastard and i pretty much called on csm and ccp to provide answers continuously for years with ccp and for months with csm until someone said lets shut him up and throw him a bone just because i get a bone does not make me happy i want the whole steak or in this case information every bit of it no one wants to break the nda it is the question of why it has taken so bloody long in the first place to go to ccp we know we know clerical error and then why has it taken months to actually get any news at all when bring it up again silly  gets pushed through the whole thing with the dead horse ccp csm and the way this been handled is purely kafkaesque manneranyway as i said before you did not respond to me you responded to all of us and do not feel bad for a second that when you did the right thing you might have to feel slightly bad about it later  that is what happens and what you did unlike so many other csm was the right thing even if i am shouting at you and making you feel uncomfortable  i am shouting at csm and ccp it just so happens you are the guy who does the right thing and talks to the people so you get the bayonet you still get my vote later on kiddo edit think of me as the guardian or ny times when it comes to the dead horse issue only with spelling errors they are pushy and obnoxious but they never blame anyone for doing the right thing even if they would critizise them for not doing morehell i would run for csm myself and give ccp run for their money but i do not want to sign the nda or make my name public for the video game
please fix my posit is a p o s
the sudden implementation without adequate consultation means i propose that the csm at least put it to a vote in the next meeting
training a skill is playing the game you want to play without payingthumbs down 
so by your reasoning watching paint dry is playing too
you fail at making sense you know you dont have to train skills i mean if its so boring or tedious or whatever you think it is just dont do it and you wont have anything to complain about seriously if skill training wasnt so important to this game i wouldnt get to laugh at all your tears notice that its the people with 3 4 5 and more accounts that are upset guess we get to play eve without 50 of the player base being alts i cant wait
i have no alts im not so much ed off at the fact that i wont be able to ghost train cald bs 5 so i could use the raven better im ed at the fact that ccp is acting like ea power of 2 30d gtc removal of ghost training ccp made a plan for this to leech as much money as possible in as little time as possible also asking me not to train skills is like asking me not to paint my house because i cant be arsed to watch the paint dry while i could be doing something else

sigh this is simple really i promiseto play you pay pvping is playing pve is playing and market pvp is playingskill training is also playing prove it otherwiseif you want to get better at any of the above things you have to train skills dont tell me you dont enjoy seeing completion imminent on that 30 day skill that is playing if ccp made a game where all you did was train skills and whoever had the most was best youd be playing if skill training isnt playing you would stop training as soon as you felt your character is where you want him to be skill wise if its not playing then there is no enjoyment of ghost training that 30 day skill and why botherbut ill agree ccps business practices are sketchy if that is what everyone is canceling their accounts about i dont blame them if its because they can no longer scam ccp out of cash so that they can train 6 alts while only paying the equivalent of 2 full time well tbh i dont care and their tears taste so sweet
6 alts theyd have to be running them 5050so thats 3 full time subs ccp just lost 3 down to 0 what would you prefer as a business
they seem to have stopped the server graph from working maby so you cant look at the huge dip in people online
make it worth returning after a break
topic states it allunlimited now
this
yes
a skill que would be nice so you could organized the training a little more and with ghost training being disabled i think ccp is allready programming the skill quei just think it should have been done years ago ghost training shouldnt exist and the que should have been there from the startwith the ghost training disabled im tbh surprised to see so many ppl whining about having to actually pay for accounts while training training sp should be the reason to pay for the game not a reason not too
hell yeah how many forum posts do we have to initiate just to get something that a majority of players want and all players would benefit from what is wrong with you peoplei logged on today to start a post almost exactly like akita did so i was pleasantly surprised to see that im not the only one who was utterly shocked by the sudden end to the only if not tenable rationale that one could possibly make against having a skill queguys i pay money for this game and i really love it but i find it insulting that your interest in customer service is so low that you would ignore such a vocal request from so many players if my company did this we would go out of business long before you guys will please this is a detail do it now and let us get on with getting our full moneys worthoh and by the way just in response to ccp wranglers post on the previous forum post about this i have this to say people log on to play the game not to change skills i will log on when i want to play not because i will perhaps play from some whim that will overcome me suddenly when i log on to change skills if i got something else to do i will log on change the skill pain in the a and log off so i can do something likeohlive my real life i have a life i want to enjoy my life part of the enjoyment i get from my life is playing eve however having to log on just to change skills or losing training time just because i cant get to my computer to do so only takes away from my enjoyment of this part of my lifeget over yourselves stop jerking us around and give us the unlimited skill que now

there is no reason not to have a short skill training queue of 2 or 3 skillsnoneim constantly having to train  not the skill i want to train  but the one thats going to last until the next time i can log inone real problem here is if i want to train a new skill the training times are so short that i cant start one unless i can be on for at least that amount of timean example here is the learning skillsthe best way to train learning skills is to train all your memory and intelligence skills first  because those are the attributes that all the other learning skills use what that means is  i do not want to be training some other skill i want to train those skills in that orderthe way things are now  i have to schedule even starting to train these skills for a time when i can be online long enough to get at least one of them to a level where i can let it go for a whilethe end result  is that i have partially trained skills all over the placewhile im on  i train my short time skills then have to switch to some other skill when i have to log off that will last until i can log back in againwaking up at 0200 just to reset a skill is not something i should have to be doing for a computer gamethe computer game should fit around my life  not the other way aroundprior to the end of ghost training while i disagree that it was the problem it was made out to be  yes  i could see the logic in not wanting someone to string together long term skills and not have to log in ie pay for that character for several monthswell  ghost training is gone now  so you can stop penalizing all of us because a few people were doing thatas i said over in the ghost training thread  youd have gotten vastly less flak about ending that  if youd accompanied the end of ghost training with the addition of skill queuesas to the suggestions mentioned  i dont like the idea of the half speed training why take the trouble to code that just make it 23 skills the total training time of which cant be longer than some period that period should be at least a day but you could make it as much longer as youd like for people who have to go on travel or for some other reason simply cant login for an extended period of time several weeks might be very helpfulget the idea right out of your heads that being forced to login to change a skill is going to encourage people to play the game all it does is make people not want to play this game at alli may login now and again just to check my skills  but if i dont have the time at the moment to actually play  then i dontlogging in and playing is solely governed by my having the time and desire to do so  not having to log in and reset a skill
simply add a skill queue limiting of queue time not necessary that clears should an account become inactivenot keen on the dual skill halfspeed mechanic
makes my life easier
1 for skill queuing
no profit for the dead
1 bombs should be fire and forget there should be no reason a bomber should have to stay uncloaked until the bomb triggers2 range should be selective and have more of an option then 18km being that up close and personal make for almost no chance of surviving a bombing run 20km 30km 40km should be able to select the flight duration of the bomb3 cost of bombs should be halved at least between the short range attack the inability of the pilot to escape in stealth mode while the projectile is in flight and high cost of ammo makes this a waste of skills to learn make the stealth bomber a useful ship to use if nothing else allow for the bomb release and cloak back up with 2 seconds
this really needs to be fixed the stealth bomber using bombs is nearly useless as it stands right now
yes please
supporting this one
wow surprised this has to be voted on
sure with better time frame for preparations and more of odditys as prizes than powerful tools
haha joss  now youll be paying while youre not playing to do the training
i dont care about ghost training too much if i play a game i play it no need to not pay and trainskill queue would be kinda nice thoughreducing training times hmm yes some skills definitely should be decreased in time to train no because it just would spam the market with those selling 50 million sp char blablain general i would prefer to have the l5 skills a bit less important and long and have the lower skills a bit increased some l1 are too short some l5s are kinda too long but the general overall time for a skill should remain as it is maybe shortened by 510 over all but it isnt really necessaryikonia
just make advanced spaceship command rank 3 it is a pointless timesink for the most part freighters take l1 of it but everything else requires level v
please just let us war dec the npc corps
changing empire wars in any way is really a horrible idea the way it is now is most realistic real wars dont have god damn victory conditions dictated by some third party organization
eve must be the only mmo game that does not support parallel training of all accounts since the training model is designed based on real time passing and thus has huge training time for advanced skills and incorporates offline skill training to counterbalance the length of the time needed to pass for these skills we should be given the ability to have all three of the characters that each account can have under it be trainable at the same time in parallelthis proposal willa might stop the deletion of alt accounts under the withdrawal of the ghosttraining featureb generate immediate income from the character transfersc rectify a longexisting grievance against multicharacter players
actually without this ill probably keep 2 empty character slots until my first one is finished training which will take aboutforeverid love to build a new character but not if it slows the progress of this onewhats the point of having 2 extra slots if you can only develop one character at a timeand my communist attitude prohibits me from taking another account just to enable skill trainingi will not take another account until ive filled all my character slots but seeing as that will take foreverfully supported
it still comes down to fixing a side effect of the skillsystem if you take this idea a bit further to allow you to dictate where your training resources go it may help the new players as wellwith that i mean with that1 allow 3 characters to be trained on a single account at normal speed2 allow 1 character to be trained at 3 times the speed this to accomedate players like me who like to operate from a single identity instead of detaching your ingame self even more by having mulitple characters to enjoy all content
i believe minimum time for all skills lvl 5 is between 22 and 25 years i can understand somewhat how this would make it easier for the character farmers to operate but at the same time it hinders us casual players we cant log in both characters at the same time so please let us train them at the same time
why not
makes sense to allow all three to train at once after all you cant play them all at once so whats the problem if people do things ingame that require two characters to be logged in at once theyll have two accounts either way i dont see how ccp would lose much by doing this it might possibly dilute the value of characters sold via the forumsbut that affects only players big deal
supporting this as it has been said we cannot play two or three characters on the same account at once so for dualboxing or more youd still need other accounts giving a person the ability to train all characters on their account at once is long overdue
a definetely no smartbombs shall not be made bigger than now else tacklers are useless
tacklers have 20k disruptors right this would only prevent the use of 2 point disruptorsif you want more than that there is at least 1 ship with a bonus to range on disruptors and faction versions of them to combat faction versions of the smartbombsheavy interdictors have what range again and infinite point they were designed to tackle super capsi dont see how you can be so against it not a capital pilot myself so not voting but i cant see the arguments as valid either
nolarge smartbombs are already very powerful better smartbombs would be horrific news for frigs drones and citadel torps
in other news citadel torps are having their hp almost quadrupled
the problem with this suggestion is that a capital smartbomb is a dronefighter nerfthis alone should be a reason not to go with it
you know what we really needcapital bombs
they increase the damage points on citadel torps and suddenly theres a need for capital smartiesi dont think its a good idea
hello the purpose of this thread is to garner attention towards the upcoming eve nerf that will take place in the winter expansion by posting here and ticking the support option you are forcing ccp to take a further look into what these changes would do to the game mechanics or at least to be more aware of it and hopefully respond to the outcry raised by the communitybut let me be clear this thread is not meant to imply that nanos do not need a nerf or that all of the changes ccp proposes are bad rather this is for those of you who feel that ccp is simply going too far in nerfing the speed and mass of every ship in the game among other things while trying to sell all of these changes to the community as a batch speed rebalance here is the original dev blog on the subject
ok now why in the world would a nerf to the entirety of the game be a bad idea well first lets look at why ccp thought this would be a good idea in the first place1 complaints thats right especially since the introduction of polycarbon rigs there have been a huge number of complaints that certain classes of ships namely hacs and recons can simply go too fast avoid too much damage and be able to fly with minimal risk and that this is not fair personally i agree as someone who has flown the nano ishtarcerbreconinterceptors a lot i will admit that the speed of hacs and recons in general is imbalanced2 physics breaking aspect ok so ccp claims that fast ships break their physics engine is this true well it might be at extreme speeds but i dont want to challenge this claim what i do want to make clear however is that speeds of any ship going 15kmsecond or less do not break the physics engine in any way in fact i lost a 10k taranis to a pos while doing 10k due to lack of transversal a few weeks ago that said it is entirely possible that a 28k ares may be so far beyond the bounds of ccps physics engine that almost nothing except webs and neutralizers can touch it i still think it would be more correct to say that ccp never designed counters for these ships especially considering the sizes of todays grids and the vast amounts of space that they are able to transverse in seconds3 common sense if these things are true if you can have an 80 man roaming gangwith an average speed of 45kmsecond with hacs able to deal insane amounts of dps speed tank most cruiserbs class ships all with minimal risk especially after the initial grid load then you have a broken system while there are ways to fix this aside from nerfs such as fixing certain ships and adding new ships that specialize in antispeed it is certainly easier to simply nerf all of the offending shipsnow that we have an idea of why the general community would recognize that the speed of hacs and recons in particular is out of whack lets look into what ccp proposed to fix this1 increased mass and decreased velocity for virtually every ship in the game2 nerfing namedt2factiondeadspaceofficer mwds to t1 status3 nerfing webifiers4 taking 1 of 3 speed variables mass out of the game5 nerf to overdrives snakes speed hardwirings and skirmish warfare moduleswhew so just to be clear any ship that ever undocks will be affected by this nerf rather than going through these changes and explaining why each is less than optimal or just horrendous in some cases i will say this to all of you especially ccpthe game mechanics in their current state tranquility are probably as good as they have ever been there are many people that would be perfectly happy with playing the game as it is for years to come no one person is complaining that for example nano megathrons are overpowered or that a t2 speed fitted 65kmsec interceptor is broken so why nerf these ships i have heard ccp devs say before that the smaller the change the more desirable it is when it comes to fixing broken aspects of mechanics so lets fix these broken ships huh lets think for a second straight math if the average speed of a nano gang were to be changed from 45kmsec to 35kmsec the maximum possible speed for interceptors from around 30kmsec to 15kmsec mind you this is with 5bn invested in a 15m hull and the maximum speed of ships such as the vagabond from around 15kmsec to 7kmsec then i think wed all agree that that would do most of what needs to be done to fix current mechanics it was never your 4kmsec ishtar that you could not kill if you really put your mind to it it was that 8k rapier or that 12k vaga or that 10k machariel or that 20k ares
lets not get caught up with whether this is perfect or not though this is merely an example of how the few ship classes are broken can be brought inline without a nerf to eve in general if you need any more proof look at tracking look at missiles the devs know theyve broken these things on their test server so are forced to come up with a new missile formula even though nobody ever complains about missiles nowadays and who knows about tracking theres a 25 page thread that the devs have commented on with numbers and graphs galore proving that the nerf will also nerf many other aspects of the game not to mention the isktime people have put into things such as deadspace mwds implants or command ships in closing think about this a bit thats all i ask thanks
scripted webbers along with a couple of other additions would leave killing nano in the hands of the playerswhere it should be
supporting this nerf stupid speeds but dont go too far
personally dont really care much about nanos although speedfits imo should be a viable option although id probably say polyssnakes need rebalancing certain hacs completely rely on this anyway and are perfectly balanced on current tq mechanics eg vagabond interceptors need their current tq speeds to avoid being suicide machines what they did to interdictors for instancethe farreaching changes to all ships in eve and all combat which obliterate entire ship classes and playing styles however are the problem on sisi there is no reason to fly a interceptor short of producing t2 killmails most nonsniper hacs are just badthe massive devaluation of solo tackle bothers me a lot slowing down all bigger ships by the mwd nerf and direct massspeed nerfs bothers me even more total shift of balance which utterly shafts shortrange ships which already on tq are limited in usefulness is insane the missile changes on sisi are a joke as they do nothing to help smaller ships as long as you fit a tp and prevent you from damaging ships of same size fully without a tp  the suggestions that people should fit abs for speedtanking on anything except frigates for solo lol kills is laughable and only applies to killing solo targetscurrent iteration of sisi and seeing theyve failed to change anything meaningful is a major letdown and there were good suggestions even in the flameridden feedback threadbasically ccp ignored all important feedback and just decided to pursue their own vision of new eve combat tq mechanics gistii b  poly sabre meets artycane and artillery really has utterly horrible tracking result 20s later 35 mil worth of easy loot i dont live in 00 but i dont understand people whod use a 100 mil dictor which is such a horrible deathtrap
i agree with op there are a few things that could be done to mostly eliminate ludicrous speed that would not have such far reaching consequences to eve pvp as a whole i actually think eve is very close to wellbalanced right now so almost any change is going to be bad
op is obviously correct supported
support lets not nerf the fun
why ask for a vote if you dont accept nay votersi disagree recons seems very solid in taking over gank pvp but with far larger risk then nanos do as it should bea concern i have is interceptor survivability though
im not a fan of the current nano nerf speed tanking as a whole as well as unrelated ships blaster boats are changing bordering on extinction when only a few changes need to be made to poly rigs and snake implants a serious rethink is needed
i think it has something to do with the fact the missions were made before t2 battlecruisers and t3 battleships i might be wrong but if not then it is simply an oversightfor the sake of shooting rokhs abaddons hyperions and maelstroms i support
im pretty sure an overview of npc ship types roles and effects is needed and this should be a part of it
in fact a groundup review of the way ratting and missioning is structured is urgently required
tier2 bc need adding as well
signwhat makes eve a lil unicolored is the never changing environment i would love to come to a place that changes personally id love to see a situation like a foreign race from a far distance galaxy wants to invade our galaxy and should turn the so beloved hisec into a partially fatal and dangerous area so taht corp claimed systems get the chance to become an island of safety deep somewhere in space that would be great but i dont think that the game engine would give a chance to do something that brings more variability into the worldnon competitive games are kinda vanishing from the market i hope that ccp makes eve more competitive than it is right now
no
hehe nice idea problem is that those players doing escalations then are nothing but cannonfodder of course i would love to have more chances to pvp and i would prefer that all of eve is pvp area fully but since the game engine isnt really developed for pvp this would just bring problems and would be kinda onesidedin general pvp in eve is in comparison to other games a bit boring pirates only attack when they have a safe win else most flee that brings up those gankings and suicide gankings from lowskilled players with just the wish to post a kill somewhere high quality 11 exist maybe in the dreams of some developers but not ingame as long as it is like that it should remain as it is i prefer pvp but not by being ganked when ever possible
all that will happen is lowsec ones will get declinedignored
training is playing if you want to play you should pay
how do you make the thumbs up and down just wanna qoute dennis leary  stfu next 
you are correct i only have 29m sp and have been playing every day im off work since making my charicters just because you are a new player do not think you can not do anything
it is annoying to see the service  pay argument all the time when in the real world there is also some counterexemplesin france mobicarte and others cards permits to emitreceive phone calls and have a number phone for a limited amount of money but if you use all the emit credits or dont use it you still keep your number phone and the capacity to receive calls with for six months without having to pay anything more after 6 months you have to pay or more earlier to be able to emitit is unfair about all others persons who pay a monthly subscription to emit and receive phone calls isnt it no this is business this motivates to buy new creditseve online did this too we paid to be able to play but if we stop we still have some skills points but not able to play do missions etc so this motivated to return to eve online after a small breakccp decided to retire it instead of doing a compromise and did a really bad communication about it calling implicitly all users of this maybe unintended feature like cheaterssorry but this is difficult to accept thatif i remember correctly i can be wrong ccp say that after the account is expired the skill point progression will stop within 3 days it is possible to do a compromise of the suppression of this feature as the infrastructure is online like stop it but after 1520 days not unlimited make more difficult to do some abuses but this keep the capacity of eve to remotivate players to come backbecause you play and have fun when you see the progress bar of a skill gain a nanopixel curious definition of playing
excuse me my first account dates back as early 2004 messed up attributes abandonedthis account is from 2005 ive quit eve a total of 3 times including this time im anything but new so you should probably get your facts straight before poastin k
in all honesty i think it is fair for ccp to stop providing service to unpaid accounts however they should realise why there are so many alt accounts the limitations of the skill system or in effect the silly long real time it takes for skills to progress thus forcing people who like to enjoy all content of the game into having multiple accounts
and everything in eve revolves around team play again to promote multiple accounts
not really sure how this works buti have ran a corp for about 3 years now and one thing that has seriously annoyed me about eve and i have no clue if others have this same frustration but if so id like to see it brought up to ccp or if not maybe an answer so i wont be so annoyedim ceo and i recruit someone i give this person a role and this person then steals i now have to put up with himher for 24 hours before i can boot them because he had a roleanother issue i recruit someone and they happen to be in space they start acting like idiots or something and i have to either hunt them down and kill them wait for them to log or dock before i can kick themmy question is why as ceo i shoudl have the power to kick anyone from my corp at any time for any reason i should not have to wait 24 hours i should nto have to wait till they dock i should not have to have a vote if they have alot of shares as ceo i should just be able to kick them outwhy i cant this has frustrated me for years and i have never found a legit answer as to why just the ceo cant boot at willwhat do the rest of you think
a corp theft dont be so trusting thats your responsibility not ccp or anyone else 24 hour timer is not going away eitherb i was under the impression you could kick any one member as long as you had them in your address book and right clicked there name so youll have to wait for confirmation on that bit
you cant kick someone in space due to obvious exploit being obvious war kick them right before they get shot other side gets concordokkened
yeah makes perfect sensenotshakes head
im kinda new to here my first post in this forumwhat i miss is some kind of ammosetupmenu since weapons require a lot of swithing ammo some kind of menu where players can define their own preferred setup for ammo config would be great how do you think about thatikonia
umm i really dont think that is a reason to not let them
it wasnt a reason per se it was a counterargument but at present the rule is that no cloaking device bonus of any kind means no black ops bridge  eas is hardly the first ship that should be changed for
i ran in the last session on what was essentially a no platform platform i think weve all learned a great deal this session about what the council actually is and ive personally learned a great deal about when and how to present issues and what to expect that being said in this round of elections i am actually going to have a platform which will include a few items which i find to be of some importancecurb the stagnation of 00  while my alliance is going to do their part to spice things up i think theres a lot to be said regarding the current state of affairs in 00 massive powerblocs stale gameplay lag boring and tedious pos mechanics and a distinct lack of benefit as anything other than a merit badge all rank high on my list of things i find to be inherently broken in 00 today id decided on a tiered approach to this issue as it occurred to me that the best way to make headway with this problem was to obtain some consensus many of the solutions proposed in the last council to some of the problems of 00 warfare were rather shortsighted and proposed seemingly out of ignorance of the realities of the current state of affairs because of this i proposed to ccp that we establish a pair of roundtables at fanfest focused specifically on 00 one for those actively engaged in 00 warfare and another for those who do not currently the goal is to try to glean from those who are currently engaged those things that they like and dislike about the existing system and to obtain from those who do not partake some sense of why and what could be done to improve that the basic idea being that i am just one man with one mans skewed opinion and ideas and i felt this was the best mechanism to obtain input from a wide variety of people each having different opinions so that we may work together to chart a better future for a game we all love i am happy to say that this proposal has been accepted and i will be working to craft a series of proposals from what i hope will be a fun and successful dialogue with others at fanfest i also hope to see a greater variety in representation of the 00 alliances in the next councilcontinuity  it is my belief that having a few of us from the original council carried over to the second can help to alleviate many of the growing pains we experienced in this first iteration of the csm im not sure who else is running at this stage of the game but i know that many are not and i believe that a mix of new and old blood will ensure the most optimal configuration being on the council does require a bit of getting used to and i think it is best for us to have a few council veterans return for the 2nd goroundcustomer servicepr  i believe that ccp and all its employees are wellintentioned i also believe that there are times where they could use a bit of outside guidance in understanding the perspective of their customers there are a number of cases where simply communicating better would make people feel a lot less emotional about certain things and i have been and will continue to try to offer some guidance in this regardthose are my 3 biggest ticket items i want to stress that while my personal focus is towards pvp and 00 that does not mean i have no compassion for players in other aspects of the game i think those who have any concern in this regard can take a look at my voting record to see that i was in favor of many of our industrialcarebear proposals i believe personally that a good council member should be objective and focus on whats best for the game itself rather than selfish personal motivations i have quite a bit more to add but ill reserve that for a second post
so who is darius johnson i am sean conover a 30 year old computer forensic analyst for a major company based in new jersey usa my work for years has involved leading and engaging in internal investigations for large corporations running the gamut from employee misconduct to the commission of crimesi am currently the ceo of goonfleet the largest corporation ever to have graced this fine game goonfleet is also the executor corp of goonswarm who happens to be the largest alliance ever in eve i dont want to delve into a resume of accomplishments but suffice it to say managing a 3000 member corporation and a 6000 member alliance takes a great deal of effort and organization goons are involved in every single aspect of eve and it is our responsibility as leaders to ensure that their path to fun is as clear and unobstructed as possible this is often a great challengei happen to love eve online it is the greatest mmo i have played since i was a member of the lut guild in ultima online i believe in a sandboxstyle pvp environment and no other competitor exists being that uo lost its way a long time ago i believe i offer a semiunique perspective in that my primary focus is on preserving the balance in the sandbox between risk vs reward i believe that the spirit of eve must be preserved at all costsbut darius youre a goon and youll already get a billion votes im not wasting my vote on you that is the argument of a man id like to call the cynic the reality is that you should cast your vote for the person you feel will serve the best regardless of any preconceived notions you may have on the amount of support they will receive i expect much greater turnout this cycle and more hotly contested election and i will require the support of as many of you as possible in order to continue our fight to preserve and improve this great game
1 what is your stance on the current implementation of the skill system like the turning off of ghost training and what not and do you have any suggestions to put the storm thats raging as a result to rest2 do you have any prospects or solutions to also help sort of the issues surrounding high sec space like the war dec system and the intentions of keeping the industrialist strong and ever growing in high sec all the while to encourage movement to 00 space without the ever ending loop of greifing because we want to make them move to 00 but ignoring the side effect of squashing any particular chance of such a thing from taking place due to continued harassment and of course maintaining the freedom of the sandbox environmentps im likely to vote for you anyway  o  but i dont see this discussed at all other than large rants im curious as to your viewpointoh and to everyone else not all goons are alike o 
werent you in the first csm
didnt you read his post o ps thats a yes by the way
hello i hereby announce that i will be rerunning for the second cycle of the csm my main priorities remain smallscale 00 pvp and game balancing in order to achieve greater fairness you can find my idea background and programme on my campaign site you can read about my ingame history in eon13 if you are lucky enough to have a copy of it evemagcom has recently made an interview with me you can read it here
i am throwing my hat into the ring if nothing more it will provide the players of eve a source of great amusement feel free to ask any questions below and ill do my best to answer them ill field any topic relating to eve edit i suppose i should include a short platform i wont write nearly as much as i did last time but here are the sticking points in terms of prioritymore communication the past week has been a good example of what we should expect from ccp i aim to do what i can to keep it that waylimiting entrenched interests there are a lot of entrenched interests in eve from large alliances to wealthy production asset holders to highly skilled players all of them need to be taken a peg down when the differences between players are lower hegemony can succumb to competition without it stagnation will end up ruining the gamecompetition in all sectors i want to make sure we as the csm promote systems that foster continual competition in all aspects of eve you should not be able to rest on your laurels after attaining the top spot without someone else coming and taking it from you to ensure that everyone no matter when they start has the opportunity to become a powerhouse
hi goum havent seen you around on the forums much in a whileheres a questionhow much of a threat should a gatecamp be how necessary should a scout be for travelling when otherwise alone and how easy should it be to mwd back to a gate in the event of a storm on the other side
1 it depends on how big the gatecamp is for the majority of ships a significant gate camp should be pretty much certain death if we are playing a game with nonconsensual combatand i think we are then landing on the same grid as a bigger and more coordinated force means youre going to take losses if there is only one of you losses pretty much means that youre toast the only ships that should stand a reasonable chance of running a significant camp are force recons covertops and blockade runners that doesnt mean getting back to the gate is out of the question2 it depends on where you are if youre deep in hostile territory then a scout should be necessary if youre a small force if youre in friendly territory then it should be less necessary this dynamic is more a result of player actions than it is of anything inherent in the game through and i dont think it will be changing any time soon 3 it depends on how specialized the gatecamp is if theyve got recons and inties youre probably not going to make it or at least one of you isnt going to make it i doubt this will change much prepatch to after patch nor should itthere are really nasty ways of making a camp that is more or less impossible to run without a cloak or to even get back to the gate without relying on the other side messing up17km web 34km scram w 5000 scan radius is possible atmeve is a dangerous place and gatecamps being an entities ability to enforce its terms on anothers travel is important to ensuring combat occurs everyone has to get somewhere sometime and i think that that should difficult and should usually entail shooting people
dont forget to add my issues to the listfactional warfare complex spawn mechanicslack of focus and goals in factional warfarebreak mission monopoly obtaining standing through different meansstanding recoveryskill queue and 30 day gtc now that ghost training is gonesee mail and internal communication
the problem with the hauler is that you have to get it out there and back as well you arent informed indirectly when its destroyed i think its much better to actually put the assets directly into your holdaccount even if that is in lowsecempireif you have to leave it and come back then that seriously advantages large alliances since only they have the assets to protect these things for periods of time that is why i was harping on the fact that the profit has to be made immediately without it large entrenched organizations gain more production from the ability and if you want to shift power away from them that production ability has to be even for all individuals
one of the things im also putting on the docket are decoupled structures for markets etcoffline presence in something other than a station market structures especially you can log in a big empty system but you cant for love or money sell something in 00 without owning the station or finding a friendly alliancenpc stationcargohold size of the device should be small a few hours that kills the income stream when players arent around but is still much less grind than mining etcmarket structures and the interbus might be a workable solution thats very close to free deliveryas primary consumption takes place in 00 market structures would cut the need for empire markets out of the loop for these goods anchorable structure with a maximum capacity not station and a goods depositretrieval system that doesnt involve docking sentry guns from hell that respond to any attacks of any kind can place orders just like a regular station market limit one per system or so
interesting but it kills the primary function of sovereignty which is to serve as that logistical and power control structurethe solution to your problem is to try and start a utopia like the goons failed to do with the free trade zone or like cva is kinda doingthe problem being that no one wants to live there less than that they have bad policiesbeing able to enforce these policies via stations is what makes 00 a reasonable game i dont think circumventing that is a good idea even if i think its a good idea to provide pressure against entrenched organizationsi mean we want new entities to come gain power and cooperation and build stations right any hard assets should only be means to take space rather than to ignore the way that power is handled
think i had a palinean slip not anchorable constructable i mean requires sov like a much cheaper version of a station minus everything except the market and storage capabilities add neutrally aligned guns to enforce your free trade zonelet the maximum broker fees go a little higher maybe up to 10 owning alliance would be well served to put it out in the boonies so that their own activities wont interfere with the profitable tradethere are times when you wish more than anything that you could do the trade in 00 and not have to deal with going to empire even if it meant trading with an enemy the structures would be useful in that respect too sling a jump freighter or rorqual through pick updrop off stuff under cover of massive sentries jump outcan trade with everyone in 00 without opening up the station can make money off of trade even from enemies and passers by increasing volume always makes prices better well oiled economies are better at building shyt for pvp
why not just have limited access docking rights that you can assign cant we do that alreadyso if you want anyone to be able to use the market you just turn the market on public and let people dock and use itbut not store items repair etcthough it might be logistically easier to erect a new structure
yeah sure even a renting system with a mechanic for eviction aka jettison all their shyt out the hatch add a statistic for eviction rate to let people judge if the owner is likely to exploit them lots of stuff could be done cheaper would be good limited capabilities but much cheaper than an outpost to drive development of more infrastructure for supporting neutrals might even spawn an alliance business of taking over remote systems to put tradingdocking systems down and reap the income without worrying about the local influx of neutsas it stands not really a good way to open your systems to neuts without reducing security no real guarantee for alliances that things wont go sour and no great way to deal with the problems access that can be enforced would solve a lot of the problems that are introducedend up saving a lot of trips to empire for a lot of people and provide the two things most essential to playing in 00
i was just saying that i dont think that we need a new structure to do that we just need more control over existing outposts is there any reason why we would have to use a new structure i would love to hear iti think that the free trade model has a lot of merits i know a lot of people have tried it with some success and some not big blue cva and ftz are the largest that i am familiar with i think the cva model has the most merit from a security standpointeveryone is neutral until they aggress anyone for a illegitimate reason at which point they are set red and kos to anyone who cva and anyone who wants to shoot them the ftz model is too hard to administer and the big blue model is too prone to losing combat effectivenessdo we have a list of what we would need to add to stations to more easily allow this sort of activityseparate permissions for dockingall station activitiesrentingwith each one allowing a charge to be modified from 0 to fully blocked for all entitiesyou would need hundreds of slots each as well to allow contract type enforcement where so long as the station does not change hands someone can buy rights for a period of timefor an individual or corporation for a set rate and have that contract enforced you would needrented timed hangar access whereby hangar use is limited per item in the same way a can is if you dont remove the item after x amount of time where x is a variable set per corporation by the owners the item is confiscated the ability to pay for more hangar time to the owner of the stationetc etc etcthe contract system so long as it was enforcible could provide a very easy vehicle for negotiation and sale of these rightseg lets say you have an owner and a possible renterthe owner puts lists his price as 1mday 1 iskhp repair so if you want to use the service you pay a flat rate plus more for each repair then the buyer can accept that contract for say 30 days it gets sent to the owner and once both have clicked agree the station itself enforces the conditionsfake edithave you come around to my thinking regarding how your anchorable asset generator has to get assets back to the owners
if the assets go back to the owner in their own space that means a trip to empire to do something with it and also brings empire into the loop if you dont have a friendly station somewherethe isk method would be a little too artificial rats are already very artificial i like shooting drones more than rats simply because the income feels meaningfulextra market infrastructure would probably be the easiest solution that would be realistic and would close the loop inside of 00 for the most partbuilding an outpost just to support trading or housing for the neutral traffic would be a very large investment a slimmed down market structure would present something that could be fielded away from capital systems without as much risk and would allow the owners to tap into the revenue and production stream without getting their hands all the way into the cookie jaron the flipside such slimmed down structures might present a stepping stone on the way to full outpost prefer calling them stationsmakes 00 sound like a tourist destination for davy crockett or station capturethink ccp is probably considering something to that effect already albeit via the pos system probably not markets but for offline presencein truth a simple module for depositing goods in a common neutral site is all thats needed contract system can take care of the rest
makes sense but youre going to have to have some sort of docking mechanism otherwise item transfer is going to be a paintrue but i think the downsides that you have to go somewhere else to make use of themsay they get put wherever your clone is is easily outweighed by the advantage that large alliances cant get the same efficiency boost in hauling protection that they can with moons over small alliances as well it reduces over all the effort required to maintain the systemsmake them autominers that automatically mine the roids in a beltonly anchorable in lowsec and 00 andor attacking them never flags anyone would make it even more so since there are few refining and production slots empire autominers would be able to refine and produce in the same station while 00 station holder would need to move the assets at some point to effectively bring them to market
what if you could turn it all almost directly into t1 ships and lootim tossing around the idea of having a very fast responding production system based on the same kind of selfassembling structures as a counterpart on the high end structures that can produce factionesque bpcs and are much less efficient with the loot but produce shinier thingsimagining an anchorable structure safespotable that you add a few hours of planetary goo to and it finishes itself off into a low level form thats capable of churning out meta and t1 goup thats directly useful for pvp etcnot a well rounded out idea but basically something where the lowest common denominator of 00 access is that you invest tenmillion cleverly and within a few hours your outfit becomes a cloud of zerg with ships upon ships to burn upgrade paths would be nice and cool but initial production ramping should be of a fast pace that makes entrenched infrastructure unnecessary and provides the necessary ships to try zergrushing against the neighbors and prepare for sov level combathave a feeling large alliances aware that t1 is not the best way to go with capships on the line would be better served by more quality goods in an environment where patrolling is involved these quality ships are less useful and more a liability due to intermittent zergling attacksadmittedly dont have it rounded out but thats what ive been throwing around
then its only good if youre being attackedsince you need to get ships out there you already have one have a place to store them which means they are just like minerals anyway or you have a pos something we are trying to get away from neeeding and still have to find a way to protect them with these assets as someone runs you overi dont think directly into ships and loot will work unless youre tuning it directly into ships and loot at a station of your choosing it would also cut into tech 1 ship producers profitswho run on thin margins already and so could only be reasonable if there was some other production system implemented that would allow production with competitioni think its too heavily slanted towards organizations that already have stuff in the area i mean do you know how much fun goonswarm would have with something like that we have carriers dedicated nearly entirely to bringing frigates back to the front lines so that goons can get in them once they get blown upnow you want to give us cruisers and frigates et all with even less logistic work something that even our small gangs can use yea i dont think that is conductive to the general power balance in the gamenaw they would do it both if there was a fight on established alliances would zerg the  out of whatever they could anyone that wasnt podded would get back in a ship as fast as possible and have it out a ship in the fight  a better ship 10 jumps outfake edit i was working hard to get that plug in
going to read your production plans sometime this weekend got through the first page and sounds like you understand why its a kinda broken mechanic compared to lots of thingsshameless plugs are always okay when its a relevant good idea d

edit typoits official i candidated officially for csm  ccpafter fanfest i will drop all my leading roles within the alliance intrepid crossing irc and within my corporation eye of god eog this in order to be able to function 100 properly as csm for the eve players communityno more details will be given so far until the campaigns really kick offi ask all my friends that i have met in the 55 years that i play eve to support me by giving me your vote also votes from people i dont know but theres a fair chance you may know me to vote on mei ask all of you friend and in game enemies for your support as being csm is a neutral position serving the eve players communityextremeo
firstand my vote 
wooohoooooo
why are you dropping roles if youre unbiased having them wont matter and if youre biased dropping them wont matter unless your intention is to drop corp and abandon all your friends permanently youll still have effectively the same ingame interests for that matter the only way to avoid having ingame interests is to quit playing and i dont think thats what anybody wants in a csm rep
what i said is that i drop leading rolesirc alliance and eog corp has very good leadership and great staff so yes i can afford to drop my leading roles in effort to spend my time 100 in function as a csm delegatein my opinion it serves the community best to serve the whole community by declaring my self neutral i dont ask of anyone else to do the same its just the way i like to do businessin no way i will leave eye of god nor will eye of god leave ircextreme
proposal revision to moon mining and exploration  randomness
will we finally get an answer soon even a to bad guys to bad you trained a minny dread would be nice at this point i have been checkng this post ever day for like 3 months now and every month they say they will look into is next meeting but i see no meeting mins or anything
though i think losing the ghost training sucks i never really did understand how one could get benefits from the game without paying for it howevera skill queue is only fair now please everyone go to this link and voice your support for a skill queue if you are also upset about the loss of the ghost training
1000 skill queue
the only difference between what you guys are doing and the current american administration is that the people in the us cant even exercise their freedom of speech let alone get their leaders to give them what they wantplease ccp make our enjoyment of the game about logging on to play as opposed to anything else why else do people sign up anyways
i think 5 skills is sufficient
yesterday pleasesigned
this thread is relevant to my interests
nerfing the socalled ghost training was a stupid action and the dishonest explanations added insult to injuryim not sure whether a skill training queue would calm me down but its absence is an obvious failing

dur bring it back
if you didnt want to do it ccp u shouldnt have started it every new alliance has the same right to have an in game logo as the old alliances
this needs to be fixed
thisgood for noobs  4hr  6 hr takes care of workschool etcnot so noob 6 day  15 day ok kids time for vacation in yellowstone oldtimers  23 days  45 days did i forget
it absolutely disgusts me the way ccp has handled this ghost training thing if i dont see some forum of que in the winter expansion i am going to be very displeased at this point if any one asked me what eve was like i would tell them to not even think about wasting there time with this game
yeah i agree those words were insulting when someone who has to get up to go to work sets his or her alarm to change a skill in the middle of the night theyre not going to settle in for some eve time ive heard of quite a few people doing thatbut ccp is solidifying their position and reputation as spinmeisters ive been in eve almost 212 years and ive about had it i cancelled nine accounts well eight because one is on a gtc thanks to another ccp stupidity  bugs in the credit card processing an issue widely reported in the forums they will all be reactivated after they suspend but after varying periods calculated to cost ccp some money
there are a couple viable tactics that can make use of the stealth bombers as a bomber limited numbers of hostile bombing dronefighter blobs suicide bombing you can launch more than one bomb with your ship before dying too go at it with 2 or 3 bombers so not all have to die and you have the recipe for a nifty battlefield cleanup alternatively one of the bombers can carry a lockbreaking bomb to allow the others to escape it now becomes a question of timingoverall i agree though with your first point fire and forget cloaking should not hamper the ability of a bomb to deal damagethe issue now becomes that your ennemies have basically no chance of getting back at you considering your lack of cloaking duration penalty and minimal signaturealso have you tried using an ab instead of a mwd so as to minimize your signature while getting away x5 locking time because of a mwd doesnt help that and put some tank modules it is quite easy to quadruple your effective hp if you can be bothered to fit for it this puts you in the same position as a dictor pilotthe range issue i dont necessarily agree with its a bomber not a sniper this is debatable give a longer flight duration and your targets have more time to leave too so youd end up having to get up close anywaythe last point i disagree with while bombs are indeed terribly expensive they are one of the few area of effect damage available with smartbombs and dd the others all have their disadvantages one has very high cap cost and limited range the other requires a titan but on a damage dealt to isk ratio theyre not bad at all considering they have an immense alpha and a huge area of effectoverall i agree that stealth bombers need looking into though
no this is a stupid suggestion unfortunately ccp already made the absoinglutely stupid decision to nerf socalled ghost training funny i dont recall ever seeing it referred to by that mildly pajorative term until they decided to nerf it
oh yeahabout freakin time too
i dont know why ccp even think they have to ask
without getting into the debate about rulesprizesparticipants etc i remember getting up at 3am to watch the first couple of alliance tournaments they were that enthralling the newer players should get the chance to witness them toothey should be a constant fixture ever 6 or 12 monthsi definitely support the pvp championships

no need to ask just organize it

yes please
hell yes

get a move on nova new tourney
agree
as long as the make it completly differnt with a good prizemix it up with something new and crazyoh and for prices have something like faction titan im sure it wouldnt be hard to wip up one with the whole faction war state against state thets get some state issue titans
i believe 50 is too drastic however i would support a 515 reduction in training times this would allow some of the newer players to catch up to experienced in their chosen specialization before you go asking how it allows newer players to catch up i will make it simple char a is 4 years old and has maxed out all ewar skillschar b is new and wants to go ewarchar a is off training something else while char b maxes out his ewar skills 15 faster than char a did
fyi there are rumors of new learning skills i think getting something to help speed up learning a bit would be nice really how can you be against it but 50 is a bit greedy
i dont think this idea is good for the gameyou get a shiney new ship without gaining the knowledge of how to use effectively people will skill for the ship get creamed and quithow do you plan on reimbursing the players who trained on the old skill timesif this was implemented it would cause a massive rift between newcomers and some of the older players
that already happened when new pilots got more sp to start out with 
just be like everyone else and sit through the time with 50 reduced timetitans would be the next battleships

something i used to enjoy doing every week was getting to watch eve tv every week to we what was going on outside the systems i called home myself and my corp m8ts would all watch and talk about what was going on and it really made us form our own opinions about diff alliances ext but my point is bring it backi propose that is should be a once a month thing maybe with a special episode or two if something big is going on in the universe please discuss other ideas the main focus of this thread is just bring back eve tv in some form of a regular thing
supported
haha yeah i miss evetv
yes this would be a good thingtm
you know i just realized that this thread isnt about being able to jump into to lowsec or 00 than back into highsec because jumping to a lowsec system right next to highsec is basicly 0 riskthis is about lazy people wanting to jump around in highsec and completely avoiding jumping 20 jumps to take stuff to market or visa versa they just dont want to be scanned down and ganked after people see whats in their holdhint courier contracts
try reading before posting pleasethen you might have something useful to say
it would be idiotic to allow this just one more step towards complete immunity for haulers
as a jf pilot myself i dont see the point in this the only dangers in lowsec or 00 cynos is to the cyno alt itself for a jf jumping to a friendly station npc there is no risk the only time a jf can be killed is the following1 using gates in lowsec to reduce fuel consumption lol yes some fools actually do it2 jumping into a system with no station and getting jumped3 undocking and getting ejected outside docking range then an infinipoint heavy dic prevents you from jumping4 being bumped out of docking range while waiting for the session timer to change after jumping into a systemall of these can be avoided by using common sense and if you do the worst case scenario is that your 4misk cyno alt gets killed while your 4b isk jf docks safely after that just undock warp to 0 and jump into highsec nothing can stop you once you are in warp to the gate unless you ctd when clicking on the gate the latter actually happened to me once but luckily there were no pirates very stressfulpart of me wants to agree with the op just so i can save my cyno alt and jump without worrying about local checking for pirates before jumping choosing the best station for undocking etc etc etc on the other hand using a jf is very safe hell i remember having to use a freighter to 00 and lowsec and yet i didnt complain just be happy we got jf from ccp and stop whining about being 100 safe
historically eves economic focus for market movement has been on the direct production and trade of player made and mined materials for other players consumptionafter looking through the dated but still relevant first quarter economic newsletter which was released this week i feel there are some growing issues with the model which might want to be addressed in new ways both from a standpoint of virtual economic growth and game play enrichmentgiven that only four percent of the character population in eve was in a state of continuous production of goods we may be faced with the following condition that it was only profitable for four percent of eve to be in a state of sustained manufacturing if we make an estimate that between fifteen to thirty percent of these industrialist were not producing goods for the market but were producing for internal alliance corporation or self use to replenish stock piles fuel expansion or missioning we are left with only 36 to 28 of eve finding it profitable to be producing and selling to market all the timewhat id like to propose to help such a situation if it exist and to add to the enjoyment of the game is a new way to convert the stored purchasing power of isk cash to longer term investments that would help to make room for greater development and complexity of the eve economic model with the development of a planetary asset system along with a revamping of the eve npc trade goods marketa planetary asset system would consist of a way to buy a lot of land or a production facility on a specified planet that produces a commodity the types of commodities should be based on those which currently exist in the npc trade goods marketthe idea would be that a character in good standing with the faction or corporation which governs a specified planet gives a character the ability to purchase a virtual asset from them this assets price is determined by the commodity it produces and in what amount the asset is taxed weekly based on its profitability and the characters standing with the fraction or corporation that holds sovereignty over it asset should produce the same commodity as the sovereign corporation supplies in the npc traded goods market additionally by investing significant isk and resources into the asset over time the character may increase its productivity and worth but the amounts of time isk and resources in the form of other npc trade goods to do this should vary by the planet and randomness asset development should also be a long term goal taking much higher amounts of isk and resources to increasingly develop with a rising tax rate and upkeep expenses to match an assets rating should not be done on a level system but instead by a less quantified indicator with an efficiencydevelopment rating that goes from 0 to 100 and it should be an estimated rating as far as players are concerned as this will introduce a real world like risk mechanic and make the appraisal of assets more subjective to individuals own perception of its worth and knowledge of how to profit from the produced commoditya stagnate system of level based prices should be avoided for an active trading market with healthy volatility based on changing conditions with the asset and linked with supply and demand for the commodity it produces on the open market
in my view this opens up a whole other area for economic opportunity but stays in line with eves theme assets also make for a more natural place for ccp to take isk out of the economy that missioning and over mining dump in with a mechanic that can fight inflation and deflation and bring players an enjoyable new challenge i would also strongly encourage that as little new art assets and other visual resources be used for this and that it blend as seamlessly into the existing game as possible with a simple interface which stresses the raw figures but random common events that would affect a commodity such as floods for wheat slave uprisings or industrial accidents should be addeda factor besides the economics of owning an asset is the reshaping of the npc trade goods market this can usher in it would make it easier to introduce mechanics that instead of artificially limiting the npc trade goods profitability it would instead make real fundamental and technical analysis of the markets possible and allow those whom do research to profit from pure hauling and trading in a new way it also introduces new levels of risk and reward along with laying down market mechanics for things such as stocks and futures trading which the player base or ccp could expand upon but most of all it adds another milestone which players can work toward even if profitability from owning an asset was a somewhat lower percentage gain then straight trading after the taxes improvements and upkeep for the asset are paid i think players would still invest the idea of owning land or a factory or a landfill even is a draw it would give players and corporations another tangible thing outside of bigger ships and net isk worth to develop around
planetery based interaction including some of what is mentioned in your post has been on ccps todo list for quite some timei do like the thought of the efficiency system you are talking about tho  but i wonder how you will get around the isk faucet issue yes you spend money initially and continually to upgrade but surely people wouldnt bother unless it was profitable and as its a continuous income the profit will either not be high enough for people to bother or too profitable causing isk to flow into the economy that wasnt there beforeif that can be balanced it would be a great addition but im not sure how that is going to work to make it worthwhile for people to stop trading with the secondary market and invest in property insteadgets a thumbs up for raising the issue tho
well to be honest this is really a first step to properly address the isk inflation and deflation issues requires work on ccps part and them allowing the market to be what it should unpredictable and based on the sways of bullish and bear sentiment toward it adding what acts as a real estate sector to the market helps quite a lot to add volatilitya next step would be putting in place a stock and futures market i have read ccps stance on the subject and can see their point which was the concern wed have only a system that makes a select few ultra rich in isk but my reply to that is that is real life and what people love about the markets the overwhelming majority of people whom enter into the market lose their initial investments yet they try several times with the same results however the markets are still there and growingi believe ccps stance from an eve designers view was completely correct if they were worried about fairness however like what happens so often with a programmer mindset they did not see what the end user was actually looking for here instead they evaluated the situation as a problem for them to solve or consider ie they were thinking how do we make a proper securities market the simple answer is you dont and you simply make a market platform peoples market sentiment and what they will bid or offer at is what makes a market people do not want a fair market they want to try and be that slim majority that flourishes and gets rich as someone whom works in the technical side of the electronic futures industry i was guilty of this myself several times when i first started outbut the securities market is another idea post for another timethe real way this specific step helps is restrained investment and productivity something not truly in the mining and industrial side for example say wheat is the hot product everyone starts buying up wheat assets developing wheat assets driving the wheat npc trade good up then pop billions and trillions of isk lost on a bubble burst even more so as your formerly billion isk worth asset is now considered overvalued in the extreme you have to sell it at a monstrous loss because its development upkeep cost and tax base is completely towering over what it is now worth but so are every other characters leading to a natural market collapse and a great deal of isk leaving the eve economy for good even worse will be if you are unable to sell the asset your stuck holding and keep paying the upkeep and taxes or do you let it downslide and loose more possibly even foreclosure the risk factors here can make for some very interesting market dynamicsit does not cost you anything to store stock piles of goods in eve you simply sit on them till the market is back up it is a factor for why the economic model has problems similar to certain industries in the real world however here to hold onto your investment it does cost you isk so we finally have a dynamic for bubbles and crashes along with booms that do have proportional effects to bottom line and ccp through a little work can use that to correct inflation and deflation not by playing god but by making sure the market model booms and crashes with what traders and speculators do when they go to extremes
you mentioned that only 4 of players are in continuous state of production but you didnt mention how using planets as factories would solve that problem and more importantly why is 4 of the total population doing continuous production a problem in the first placesecondly everybody got lots of money as soon as ccp makes planets a tangible asset itll be all purchased up you havent stated how a piece of land would be used to turn into profit its like that stuff you brought off the late night infomercials ya just gotta have it but not use itmy thumb is down because planetary interaction for the purpose of production is useless wont change the overall percentage of manufacturers in the game no reason to own a planet either itll be another form of isk sink
im going to stop you right there no reason to post another thread about stock market or mineral reserve simply because there is already a stock market mineral reserve trade etc theyre all third party corporationsoftware and i do believe that ccp stated that they wish that the market is player driven this part is already achieved and no reason for them to get involved
stupid comment tbh
personally i like the idea however a few questions maybe im just not seeing as this is your modelwould there be chains of production or straight production ie would an item be made by various properties working together say mechanical parts would need say iron carbon technical prints and construction blocks forgive me its been almost 2 years since ive played in the trade goods market or would you simply own a factory that produces mechanical partsi know this could get incredibly complex quickly but i believe if any game could sustain that its eve the other thing that id like to know is how many properties would be allowed on a planet as well as would the more properties drive down the productionquality of the items coming out of the property we all know people would try to get to jita and buy properties there for ease of sale after all yet someone who goes into a forgotten region like solitude might reap a massive production because no one wants to move goods that distance the ebb and flow is interesting as well and i believe it would make people lose as well as make fortunesthe one thing i cant stress enough however if cpp reads this do not let this idea become like moon mining concentrations ie if possible we should not have dyspo and prom planets where only the biggest factions snark them up and the entire market is buggered im not 100 sure how to combat this problem without isk faucets like omber zombie said but hopefully it can be combated one other thing that might want to be considered will security status of a system effect if a planet is able to be interacted with much like moon mining and pos anchoringthe empires basically keep 08 to 10 systems for themselves i believe they might do the same with this idea however nations thrive and grow when more and more people can get into property ownership as such maybe this would start out in any security and expand to even 00i like the idea and give it a good thumbs up kara
another thought that just occurred to take money out of the system the empires would charge a 5 to 25 based upon a new trade skill transfer tax when a property is sold between players its not huge but it would be another sink just a thought
to be honest i think id waste a lot of time trying to explain some things here from economic theoryso ill just leave it with this rather then over simplifywhy do people buy a home beyond just the need for shelter why do people do home improvement why are people so badly hurt financially by real estate value collapses why are home starts and permits such an important economic indicator why in the us are mortgage rates so closely tied to the ten year treasury note what factors strongly tie the manufacturing retailing and real estate sectors together if you are unclear on those relationships i implore you to go out and take time to research them dont just google a simple answer but actually read over a few wikki articles and government websites i think once you do youll better understand exactly what i am asking to be introduced herealso to answer your question kara i am not sure if it should be a circular supply chain in that certain npc goods are needed to produce other npc goods my gut instinct tells me yes but free trade tends to promote peace and stability something i am not entirely sure goes with ccps plans for eve given the tone of ea and factional warfare as for amount of assets per planet that is more tricky id say the majority should be in low sec and 00 though and that those planets be able to sustain far more assets but as for quality of goods given a planets total volume of production id be inclined to not have that but to certainly think on it as a future factor to put in place if characters drive a planet to over production on a regular basis and keep crashing the marketbrock i know there are third party securities and sadly i wouldnt give them a single isk this is a place where ccp shot themselves in the foot royally you cant say you want players to develop markets but then say you want players to be reluctant to trust others in investments as a core component of the game anyone following the most basic risk management rules would never invest in eve given that situation some regulation and securities protection needs to be in place in the real world government over sight does that here it is ccps job whether they like it or not and until they decide to take that responsibility securities markets in eve will not have volume or liquidity
well you through alot of words at the subject i can appreciate that but on this one area i think you are daft out of your mind i like having such a deceitful  paranoid environment it allows an honest person like myself to thrive and excel on that honestyif some sort of securities oversight were introduced good character ethics and integrity would be instantly devalued id say the mistake that is common in people like yourself you try to trap people into being good instead of letting people be whatever they are call it laws say it is for the common good whatever you want to say all i see is someone trying to place controls on my life
uiliamim not totally understanding what you are proposing it sounds like you are proposing a stock market or investment of planetary assets and productioncompletely made up which means everyones isk is completely at the benefit or harm of the gm working the associated system
it does lead to the interesting situation that npc goods can now be produced by players and perhaps that production of these npc goods is cappedheres my take before a player or corporation would be permitted to have such a franchise they would need to have considerable standing with the faction and corp that controls the planet that should raise the bar a bit further the player leases this franchise perhaps an auction could occur near the end of the lease to determine who gets it next timeadded for my purposes i propose that a planet with stations maybe just stations in the system can produce a list of goods each good would have one or more as yet unspecified units of production and each unit of production would have a station associated with it a player or corporation would purchase a lease on one or more units of production paying a monthly rate for production this is the franchise i mention above once obtained the leaser uses the proparty for the length of the lease until it expires rent for franchises would be just another payable expense in addition the leaser can use the property for the extent of the lease and make improvements to it
calling for simplified oversight on securities is trying to place controls on your lifeso say i suggest if ccp institutes a stock exchange system with a simple margin system and that players have to deposit to an account and maintain it in proportion to their current investments by some percentage or they get called and the position is liquidated to make sure there is mutual party coverage and that it remains a zero sum gamethats trying to tell everyone how to liverelying on a good ol boys system like you seem to be suggesting has never been good for anyone except the good ol boys in that club all ready what id ask for opens up trading and hauling in eve what your wanting keeps people outso whom is trying to control others here really
yup you got me im well known for my cartel like dreams and desires ill just leave you to your betterment for all though ill reiterate its bs and will never happen even if it was notwhen you go thinking up ideas why not think of things that are possible as a suggestion
the way it is now sucks eve is an mmo and youre only vulnerable to unrestricted wardecs if you leave the npc corp people shouldnt be penalized for thatnot to mention the fact that the current system strongly discourages smaller corps from formingyes wars should still exist but not in the same form change wardecs around and change the way npc corps work and problem solved
then i will basically need to create two more characters and constantly log in to micromanage their skillset if i dont then im going to be at a huge disadvantage because someone else is going to be able to do everything under the sun in eve andor sell his characters off for extra iskno specialization is good
supported
i agree honestly i think its absurd that all 3 characters cant train at the same time it makes the other two chars useless except for use as scouting alts please make this idea a reality
i doubt it you would have everyone a production and market alt most likely you still have to pay for skills books the guys who currently do production for making isk to support their pvp habits can close the other accountthis really only works for things where you want both people at the same time if you had a mining character and a separate pvp character you arent hurt anymore than having to buy all the skills books for two accounts
this has been suggested numerous times in the past and the answer from ccp has always been a very firm nothe reason is that this would hugely increase character farming and make training much easier for isk farmersif character trading was removed i can see them reconsidering but not otherwiseit would also further inflate the number of capital pilots something i think most agree is not neededso all in all bad idea
since ccp is hell bent on making multi accounting more expensive for us upping the price on gtcs removal of options of gtcs and killing off ghosttraining i now see no other way but too fully support this topic i would not have done so if the changes mentioned above had not taken place
many players are dissatisfied with how ccp has handled the ghostskilling nerf and of course with the nerf itself dealing with this issue unequivocally comes under the csm remit to representso reps please represent us please press ccp to 1 unhide the complaints thread2 stop locking discussion threads on the topic3 respond to customers complaints4 provide supporting detail for information to date that is perceived as disingenuous4 reconsider the feature change in the light of customer desires and expectationsthank youvk
ive already put it on the csm agenda for tomorrow dont worry we read locked threads too
that was fast thank youimpressedvk
i cannot believe they locked a thread  way to go ccp or should i say cccpoh i forgot i support most of the points i would prefer having a alternative suggestion than bring back ghost training like a skill que or a cool down feature where the training continues for a short while once a sub stops like a week or 10 days or something
i have already dispatched a mail to ccp saying that its unacceptable i hope it will be back open very very soon
not only does this topic deserves a thumbs up but so do you guys
this is one of the most stupid things i have seen ccp doi cancelled nine accounts they will all come back eventually but i will make sure ccp suffers economically in my accounts from this stupid action and lying explanations
has my full supportalso offer money back to anyone who signed up for the power of two promotion and who wish to cancel their accounts in light of the removal of ghost training this will remove any perception that ccp obtained money through deception and may go some way towards mitigating their terrible customer relations on this issue
ad 1 achievedad 2 unable to judge lets see what happens to this threadad 35 still missing nice to see its on the csm agenda at least
all the posts about ghost training have been locked or misplaced how long is this going to be here
i knew i voted for you for a reason
although having accepted ccps decision i still think this was very wrong and shortsighted of them they have clearly did not tell the truth about the reasons behind the removal of the feature and attempted on many levels to simply suppress the outcry if they have admitted that the decision was motivated by business sense i bet we would still have ed but at least accepted on some level that it had to be done lying to the community repeatedly and just blatantly pretending that we are all idiots is what most infuriating about the whole thing so if csm could make ccp issue a public apology for blatant lying and to give us real reasons behind the cancelation other than data base issues and unfair advantage i would probably consider that a great success
fully supported lying to the people is bad form and leaves bad taste in ones mouth
nice to see the csm sticking up for the player base

i dont like to be one who shouts profanities andor emo rages over something thats done however if some basic questions by the players can be answered i believe it might go a long way towards smoothing this over instead of hoping it will go away
op has it right
op is on the right track
we all know well that capital ships are the most expensive lucrative and powerful of all ships in eve they have a strong history of making low sec dwellers run in fear or organize in an attempt to take on the challenge of putting it downpilots whom face such massive ships and have no capital capabilities themselves all fear yet respect these powerhorses any sane man will think twice before attempting to attack a capital class ship on his ownwe all know of the great battles in 00 and epic capital vs capital fights we may hear about them by word of text ventts or even in caodfor those of you that recall that very first titan that was destroyed you may know the pilots name but what of his ships namei feel that capitals and super capitals arnt given nearly enough credit people have proposed over time that we should have some kind of stat keepings of each ship while i would give an arm and a leg figuativly speaking for this kind of spice i feel there is one first major step before adding any kind of ship statistics tied to every single shipthat step would be to make all capitals or at the very least supercapitals have permanent namesthis will in effect make owning a capital a much more rewarding feeling knowing that you are about to take hellokitty your hellokitty themed kestral into fierce combat and you know she may never come backand if you do lose that ship you will think back to what all accomplishments youve done with it and all the battles and kills it has soaked uppermanent names would give the ships more personality help make eve more immersive and indepth and make chosing a name a much more difficult task hell for me it would be almost as bad as naming my ferretsi finally settled on booger and goober p
this post gets tridiks seal of approvaleven though its a dumb ideai just like the op
meh im in iraq and bored what did you expect p you know i lub ya trid i saw what you guys did in fwthe united officialy won eve with that now to be on topic yeaits more of a rp thing i suppose
i proposed something similar half a year backbasically the idea was for all ships to be able to be named once per assembly so that once you assemble it and rename it from its stock name you cant rename it again unless you disassemble and reassemble itthe whole point of the exercise was to have stat tracking for each ship so that individual ships could have a record of how many fights theyve been in what ships theyve killed how much damage taken and output etc etcthe reason for doing all of this is to attach some meaning to seeing a ships name on the overview if some horrible pirate flies around in your area with an abaddon named dead puppies and you see it on scan you know for sure that its the same ship that ripped your buddies apart last weekyeah its an rp thing and its a lot of work probably but it would be cool
personally everyone should bother naming there shipsit just seems generic and rather boring seeing joe gamers hurricaneive seen some hillarious names as i cruise throughout high secyou got my voteme signed
titan graveyards plz
in reality what you are asking is simply to change some npc ship skin as the ship statistics and even weapons sometime have nothing to do with the player piloted shipsthorax firing missiles serpentis ships dominix not launching dronesamarr ships with weaknesses against emand so onthe npc ships live in a different universeon a bright note if you read the blog about the future optimizations it is cited in passing the beautiful idea of doubling npc damage and halving rate of fire in theory it will keep npc dps at the same level in practice i suspect we will see a increase in the number of ship lost to mission loading lag as the npc will have a large alpha so npc apparently will change how and how much is jet to be seen
situation moon exploration and mining is both unrealistic and unlike asteroid mining in that once discovered a moon is productive of minerals foreverthis makes each moon with valuable minerals something to be owned and operated in perpetuity by whichever corp can possess and defend it  by force of arms or negotiation or whateverby now every experienced player in eve knows that every moon in every system has been probed and all minerals have been discovered major deep space corps and alliances keep databases of the minerals on each moon and seek to expand their databasesby this means the moons that are worth seizing are well known and the only issue is whose fleet will be largesti suggest and propose that this entire situation be changed as follows1 moon exploration be changed to a probability driven mechanism each mineral might be assigned a partly random probability of being found lower probabilities for rarer minerals if any mineral is present on that moon at all moon probes would draw a random number partly driven by the owning characters skills and the probing equipment being used can you see t2 probes how about t2 launchers or a bonus for using a specialized ship or having specialized t2 booster modules to determine if that probe finds that mineral comment a moon is an unbelievably large volume of rock ice and dust several orders of magnitude larger than the asteroids we mine  expecting one probe to find all minerals no matter where they are hidden on the moon is just short of plain sillyif the mineral is found a certificate of location is generated see belowunder this revised mechanism a character would not be certain whether his probe found nothing because there is nothing to find or because his searching wasnt lucky this time which is much closer to real mineral exploration i expect that players would tend to use multiple probes per moon however the optimum number isnt easily determined nor is the optimum combination of skills and modulesmultiple certificates of location would be possible for a particular mineral deposit on each moon they might be held by different corps or multiple copies by a single player certificates could be sold or traded by players like any other object but can not be copied2 the certificate of location for the mineral found on a particular moon would then be required for moon mining to be effective works like a script  load it into the moon minercertificates could be stolen or destroyed if the pos is defeated based on the usual random chance mechanismmoon miners without a certificate would fail to operate or might find only the most basic worthless of minerals3 moon mineral deposits would have limited volumes and would after that much has been mined be gone the deposit quantity might be generated by random means when the deposit is discovered for the first timeeach time a moon mineral deposit is exhausted the eve system at next downtime generates a replacement deposit of same type and not yet known size somewhere in the accessible to moon miners eve universethis would limit the overall value of a particular moon it would also force the corps owning valuable moons to continue exploring for minerals since they would know that their present moons will one day be exhausted remaining size of the deposit might be reported in the moon miners screenand it would offer an incentive to every player and corp to keep looking  that elusive technetium moon might be the next one you probeimprovements requestedthank you for your time reading my thoughts todayive been ingame since beta and have operated moon mining reacting and material sales since shortly after they entered the game
i like this could use a few kinks ironed out but supported by me

your proposal would only lead to chaosunreliable provision of moon minerals will lead to unreliable provision of t2 components and hence market instability on that frontalso its already a nightmare enough to manage poses having to change what moon mineral is mined after each downtime is not an optionyour proposal also fails to take into account that not all moon miners are part of the large alliances individual corps and small alliances also partake in that activity and your proposal would render their investment voidif your objective is ultimately to lower the barrier of entry to production of items requiring rare moon minerals there are better ways to go at itheres a suggestion that does not disrupt the current investments and achieves that goalassign a presence factor to moon minerals in a given moon on a scale of 1 to 100set all existing moon minerals presence in a moon to 100randomly assign new minerals at moons on a 199 scalethe amount of mineral mined on each moon per hour is equal to that moon mineral presence factorthis proposal is of course not without its drawbacks oversupply of minerals leads to a price decrease especially for rare minerals the ones worth mining at less than 100 presence thereby making the investments of r64 moon owners moot valuable systems suddenly become less valuable too the investments people have made in probing moons over the years also lose all their valueultimately increasing the supply of r64 minerals decreases their value to the point where all minerals end up being worth the same ie the pos fuel it takes to mine them t2 items become cheaper thereby decreasing the value of industrialists investmentswhile the current situation where a limited few have a monopoly on supply is not necessarily desirable the alternative is probably worse

currently hulk invention takes 8 mechanical engineering datacores and 8 gallente starship onesi think it would be fairer for it to take 8 mechanical engineering datacores and 2 amarr 2 caldari 2 gallente and 2 minmatar starship engineering datacoresthe reasoning behind this is that hulk invention drives up gallente datacore prices so all other t2 gallente ships become more expensive doing this would lower gallente datacore prices and increase the other datacore prices and force people to trade for all the cores they need and reinvigorate the datacore market i guess you could also make it so you can use any ship data interface to invent if thats possible in the coding if not i dont particularly mind if its just kept so you have to use the esoteric one
TRUE
mining barges and exhumers are based on gallente technology so it makes perfect sense the way it is
eeehh im gonna wait a bit first before i respond o 
i dont dispute that it makes sense for them to be based on gallete technology but the result of that is a massive distortion in the datacore market which results in an inherent unfairness to those who wish to fly t2 gallente keeping the esoteric ship data interface for invention allows it to stick to its gallente roots whilst splitting the datacore cost between the races evens things out
unless you make them using different decryptors the difference is moot 8 datacores are nothing special but the difference in price to the gallente decryptors imposed by the hulks invention was staggering and is still high
isnt this one of the reason why gallente ship data interface is pretty ship compared to others
it would be great to see local only show you if you speakall for changing it
if i may speak from a none pvper point of view herethe only people that this would benefit are those that are actively seeking combat and wish to hide their numbers and general presence from other people in the systemi dont think that would be very fair to the poeple that just want to go about their business without being ganked all the time by people that are actively looking to do suchi know that happens anyway but with instant local at least people have a chance to get away or whatever they want to do calling for a nerf to catch cloaking isk farmers is really just cloaking the reason behind the thread

i agree with you there should be random concord patrols in low sec based on the security rating also there should be some kind of marker that shows up either as a message broadcast to all players in system or a simple c added to the security rating 03c vs 03 that shows that concord is in system
 all who dont see a problem with this stating if you wanna play payits just not that easy cause eves design is different you dont gain ep you just skill over time in all other mmos your free to make a new toon and bash monsters and experience
please keep the discussion to the relevant thread here
look at how stupid the op is
thats nothing its going to get much worse in the next few daysguaranteed
you guys in goonswarm should copyright that remark i have never seen it bandied around to discredit bad as well as good posts until goons came to the game
how does it feel to be a cheerleader at least op is talking and raised some valid points all i see from you are oneliners like you are on stage performing a comedy act or just bumping that certain aspect
is it a crime to agree with a goonoh wait your typecasting and applying stereotypes im sorry i guess i assumed you had the intelligence and rationality to look beyond thatill have to watch what i say in the future thenepic fail
no actually it is not even though i do not like goons in general i find myself agreeing with many of them quite often well we can leave the herd behaviour out of it for a moment i do think it is a crime to pretend not to have an opinion which what you seem to have shown in your last couple of posts just posting a quip and glib remark does not cut it i personally want to hear what you think  rather than a quote of something relatively amusing and you know why i want to know what you think even though you are a complete stranger to me because i think that for the most part part last csm was not very effective because i think this is last time i will give csm idea benefit of the doubt and i want to see how they do on the second session and because i think it really affects everyone in game including you so do not pretend to be an idiot and actually give your opinion out
for me to express my opinion in such terms you could understand would be a waste of my time not to mention everyone elseyou already made your mind up your beating your war drumwhy bother
i have a few questions for the goons 1 wtf is the deal with the musical instruments why did you waste csm and ccp time with that when so many more issues as apparent from your post exist in game at this point 2 what about general statement by goons on number of occasions especially during threadnought surrounding the shrakbait incident that they are aiming to destroy eve and ccp and if they can the will do so from the inside do you think that you are pretty much working toward that purpose to make a joke out of csm ccp eve and generally will try to muddle things as much as possible 3 please tell us what you have done while on csm what vital issues for eve have you supported do not forget the musical instruments now 4 how would you rebuff the accusation that as a leader of goons and a member of the goonswarm you are actually not trying to damage eve and through it the ccp frankly i think ccp needs a kick in the balls allot of kicks but damage to the game outweighs my personal issues of how ccp handles their customers
hey guys and girlsim running for another term on the csm the first csm was a bit of a rollercoaster but im here looking forward to hopefully making the next csm work much betteranyways whom am iim charlie eriksen from sunnyhah denmark i have been playing eve since late 2005my main profession is piracy however im most well known for my heavy carebear interest where i have been doing my own investment schemes all which has been paid back to the investors i then helped building up ebank which is now worth over 1 trillion isk i have enjoyed talking to a lot of different people and i have always accepted a convo if people wants to talk to me about csm matters i hope to continue to communicate as much as possible i will be posting more thoughts and things like that over the coming weeksi hope to see you all at fanfesti will be posting tips of the day on a regular basis heres a list of all of them thus far1  how i would like to see csm improve2  my first campaign thread and my writings about the econonmy of eve3  in the media4  behind the scenes computer science is fun5  yarrtastic6  live debate on eve radio this saturday7  going out with a boombest regardscharlie lavista eriksen
most people would agree that lavista is one of the best of the current csm he really does care about issues effecting the community and trys very hard to represent and raise our issues with the devs the way he represents us is an example of why the csm was founded and should be an example to all future csm members of how to carry out the roledefinitely worthy of a second term thanks lavista keep up the good work and good luck on reelection 8
i would also agree that despite his age the boy has done well on csm and one of the rare few who took the time to come out to the forum and keep the community informed as to the progress on number of issues this does not mean that i would not hound him or that he could not have done more lavista vista could have done more as most of the other csm members to oppose the idiocy of musical instruments for eve also there was a number of issue that csm simply said yes masa to ccp  you guys on csm have to bear pressure on ccp that is why you exist to softhanded approach not being aggressive enough with your time spent with ccp allows them to push csm over to the kerb lavista vista needs to do better than he did before not be a push over to ccp but he still gets my vote since i did not see many others do squatremember that at the end of the day you work  even if arranged by ccp  for the players of eve and not for ccp i honestly feel that csm was more of a shield for ccps recent actions in game and csm did not do enough to protect player interests as opposed to being ccps mouthpiece 99 of the time answer me this thoughoh and lavista what would you change about yourself and would you be a different csm member than you were in the past because after recently viewing your response in the dead horse issue thread it would appear you actually regret communicating with us the players some of us maybe pushy but that is how people get results not by being meek so elaborate go read my response to you and then elaborate with your answer
i would probably like to try and represent and communicate more with a broader aspect of gameplay styles i think my background is pretty well balanced but by no means perfect i have as a result of csm tried more gameplay styles in order to represent more people for instance i was never a fan of pve however when the issue of exploration ships were brought up i started doing exploration in lowsec and now im trying in 00 to see what its like i would also love to have more actual productive discussions on the forum however its not something i can change aloneand i would like to respond less to trolls but hey more perspective is never bad however nobody is ever going to be perfect but thats not an excuse not to try make no mistake however i did release information about the specific issue because you were being pushy about it not that its a negative thing however it might have been wrong of me to post as detailed an update as i did because none of the other issues had anything like thathowever i must admit i wasnt very pleased about the general attitude i was met with hence why i wasnt proud of what i had actually written while i stand by what i did write i could probably have communicated in a better way in order to have prevented it so dont get me wrong if i could i would have communicated with the players about the response we got right away but i got squized between the fact that i have an nda and i cant really talk about things before the minutes are out and the fact i dont want the community to feel ignoredits a hard balance but i understand that the current pos system is awful and that the dead horse idea looks awesome but theres not much more to say about that
much love for this guy  voted once and will vote again
quoted for truth just not the love part
there i will just paste it in
ok omber other than the fact i tried to pay to have you delivered to my hangar me hangs his head in shame tell me1 i feel csm has been very soft with ccp in other words they appeared in most cases to just buckle under ccp pressure and not investigating more when ccp refused to give answers or was evasive what are you going to do about it 2 whom do you work for ccp or players of eve and what happens when ccp tells you to bugger off do you say thank you sir may i have some more or do you fight them and demand more answers and clarification i think recent csm has walked away too many times when they could have stayed and fought the ccp if it is an issue that you feel ccp is trying to just not deal with what do you do3 what about other player communication i think last csm failed miserably at being open to the player community 4 and finally how do you feel about musical instruments in eve and do you think that we should trust a membergroup of players who have vowed in the past to do their utmost to destroy eve
should have paid me a decent amount and i would have delivered myself i agree to an extent with that sentiment you have to realise though that some answers as presented to the eve public are heavily sanitised due to nda requirements some issues fell into exploit areas which cant be discussed others fell into areas that were already addressed and were waiting on being announced by ccp basically a lot of the issues which got a simple public response were for those type of reasons as for haranguing ccp into giving more complete answers  imho its a major part of the job for the csm and when the log for the last meeting makes its way to the forums youll see pretty much everyone in the meeting badgering the devs about things at different points in the meeting if you need an example both lavista and i instantly asked questions about why the qen hadnt been published when eyejog logged in and hey presto 3 days later we have a published qeni guess its all about getting an answer for the public that covers enough detail to satisfy the request as well as allowing ccp to have some wow factor when they announce thingsi work for both im there to relay and argue issues from the players to ccp and to pass the information from ccp to the players as i said in the above wall of text  sometimes the answers you get arent able to published so what may look like the csm walking away isnt always the case im all for arguing with the devs tho if the response they give is unsatisfactory completely agree but with the caveat that it wasnt entirely the csms fault i think its a joint failure on behalf of the csm and ccp next meeting should be fun after they read this  on the ccp side until recently the csm hasnt had a ccp secured forum to discuss topics which as an alt i still dont have access to the internal communications have all been hosted by serenity cheers mate the minutes section of the eve website hasnt been updated and the assembly hall voting system is shockingly bad no negative votes is a major oversight from the csm side i think a there has been a real lack of explaining the csm decisions  yes minutes of meetings were posted but none of the csm members have cared to clarify their positions on the issues they voted on some of which were highly contentious and other than for pet projects none seem to want to go out and see what the average player thinks about what is and isnt being raised and voted on granted that is what the assembly hall was supposed to be but there are plenty of other forums on this site let alone outside of here scrapheap comes to mind i probably should register an account theretldr  more communication is definitely needed and i think pretty much everyone involved with csm agrees
damn character limiti think i actually voted yes to that one not because its something that is absolutely necessary to eve but i am eagerly awaiting walking in stations and think it would be a nice addition considering i run a live music venue in rl one of the things i continually point to when people ask me why i play eve and not wow or some other mmo is that the community here is highly creative and any way for people to express that creativity as part of this game is a good thingas for who raised it  yes the goons have said they want to destroy eve in the past so what  they failed eve beat them sorry goons they came to this game attempting to break it in the end eve was such a great game that imho it has effected them more than they have effected itshould you trust them up to you i guess i personally look at the issues rather than who is bringing them up  if i think it benefits the people that play the game im for it if i think its harmful im noti hope that answers your questions if not please feel free to ask more
so far you have oz although i think i might have to attribute your vote for musical instruments to some really strong aussie cannabis at least for my own self delusion sorry no shakes head emote on forums anyway you should make a platform and post it as i am sure others will do as well i am sure it will get hairy on these forums pretty soon
elaborate and in detail otherwise this is just allot of bull talk no hot air specific examples as to what you are referring to or what you consider to b the entrenched interests i am wealthy in game and i have allot of assets and i am also highly skilled player  so what exactly do you propose to do when you take all the veterans  down a pegfurthermore eve is hypercapitalist game and fundamentally any capitalist system is unfair as such eve is fundamentally an unfair game where someone will always have an advantage or will be entrenched to the point where there is nothing anyone can do about think about it this way in rl we have banks and rich people have their money there so we can not go and just take it what do you propose we try and rob the bank in eve i think also what you call hegemony is actually a fully egalitarian system very much opposite of what you think it is where you have to work for what you got so you would think that it should be ok for someone to surpass me in my skill points through what means how do you propose to cut my isk by hacking my wallethow do you propose to curb my purchasing power or my ability to make more isk with the isk i got through the market and thus always staying ahead of the guys with less isk do you wan to make eve into what exactly
before i start out i would like to say that i am definitely and old player i have 33m skillpoints and am near full specialization in the area that i enjoy when i play i play with an organization that is able to give me pretty much any ship that i need to do a job with any reasonable fit for free i am one of the players whose advantage has become too great over newer players edit i was typing as you edited writing another post for youthe issue is one primarily of player retention eve is a game which gains a lot of efficiency boosts as player density increases but currently the game is set up in a manner that discourages players to continue to play past their initial play time if we do not address this eventually we will get a system where new players do not want to join the gamethe crux of the issue is that the difference between old players and new players is too large and ever increasing as ccp adds new vertical advancement opportunities one of the founding concepts of eve is that additional play time would not increase specialization significantly that there was a realistic limit to how well you can specialize and that after that in order to gain significantly you would have to branch out into other areas this meant that the prime difference between a relatively new player and old player was only a few percentage points in their specialized field with the old player being able to specialize in more areaseve has moved away from this setup and it means that there is a gulf between the haves and have nots while these gulfs are important to foster combat and strife key features of eve if they are too big and of the wrong type then the have side never lets up ground to the have not side and the game becomes stagnantwhat does this mean specificallyit means that we need to reduce the item requirement grind achieving tech 2 qualification is a big thing for players but is also means that the gulf between a player has a plateau before where the differences are huge and after which they are small a good example of this is tech 2 guns the difference between tech 2 and tech 1 guns is not only the initial advantage in skill7any extra specialization but also 5080 range andor an extra 15 damageand more depending on item availability due to the fact that named items are not as abundant as tech 2 now we have on top of that thermo dynamics for another 15 damage 50 speed 10 resistances in some instances 15 repair rate etc etc i dont think that plateau should exist the item grind should be less dealing with primary statistics and more with secondary money experience and skill are plenty enough advantages for old players to exploit especially how they work together to make an advantage even larger in short it needs to be easier for people of all strata to knock the king off his throne when the king is knocked off his throne fighting occurs and that is what we play this game for knocking down entrenched interests doesnt mean changing the way the game is played for them but changing the rate at which players achieve the level that they can be a challengethere are pretty much three areas that this exists production sovereignty and individual skill i have already discussed the problems with individual skills there are some interesting ways to foster competition in production here and sovereignty is a whole other bag that needs to be addressed mostly dealing with the power of capitals and supercapitals the proliferation of pos the difficulty in removing them and the lack of realistic secondary objectives talking about that is a whole nother post but i would be happy to do so if you wish parts of that issue can be seen discussed here with nande yanendid i fully answer your question
you have to understand that eve is fundamentally a game and because of it there are a number of fundamental differences between it and the real world as well as a number of fundamental similaritiesone of the fundamental differences is that in the real world there is no overarching entity that can make changes another is that in the real world the goal of any individual cooperative actorie nations is to gain the greatest benefit for its citizens usually described in wealth in eve the goals of individual cooperative actors are to have the greatest benefit for its citizens but in eve its described in funthis means that talking about eve in terms of how the world is doesnt make much sense in eve if someone were to rob eve bank no one could do anything about it but try and shoot that person in eve we dont have a fractional reserve banking system with the full power of the state to enforce loansps real collateral backed loans would be awesomethis also means that at the end of the day in order for everyone to have fun you need players hegemony is a state where one side dominates this is bad because that is when the game ends someone has won people go home and leave the game people having fun in eve is more a less a function of the number of people playing you can produce more there is more competition for goods and services you have more targets etc fostering this is good because in the end everyone has more funnow i am going to talk a little bit about power power can be more or less described as the ability to coerce force or induce actionpower is a zero sum game this means if you gain power someone else must lose power if we assume that you have more power over your own actions than a newer player then every time a new player joins the game so long as all influence is evenwhich is a necessary assumption to make this example make sense your power increasesif only very slightly as the newer players get better they take back that power and your power decreases but for the most part they never catch up to you your power is maintained at a higher level for each new player that joinswhile this is not true in the specific case because of variables it is true in the general sense in that as new players enter the game the power of the older is continually expanded the ability of new players to have any power increase is entirely dependent on newer players joining the game the goal is not to take anything away from old players but to make new players capable of controlling more of the game this contracts the above system and reduces the amount of power that older players have the power of older players will always be higher than newer but less so and so variations due to player skill organization smarts and gumption will make a larger impact on the end result of the system than they do now

ill be voting for you as youve done a good job last time on the csm as a standin alternative and werent biased to one group or alliancegiven the resent issues with ccps lack of communication on gtc and ghosttraining we need people up there making sure that the peoples voice as a whole is heard and ccp need to understand the impact of their decisions because at times it feels like a oneway stream
remind me why id ever want to undock in my helios againfixing one ship by obsoleting another is not a solution
things i really really like about your production plan arequite a few this is my creative posting timei think an easier mechanic would be for having only bpcs for the high meta stuff just say that all ships are manufactured nowadays with nanite production molds nanites are molecularly programmed to guide the assembly of many components at the material level before final assembly in the factory a new set of instructions like ship dna so to speak are required for every production runthus we have only bpcs and all production degrades if new bpcs arent produced maybe they derive from t1 data blueprints the only bpos and are produced themselves with nanotooling much like dies have to be manufactured with special equipmentback to actual game mechanic stuffrolling production anticreep and systems that require constant reinvestment to stay competitive are good because they erode the top end and keep things churning regardless of player agecapital and research aheadnesssomething i was also thinking about was instead of increasing the real uberness of highend gear increase the coolness one implementation could be to have dummy items that reference an existing item in the database but have a customized name ie goonswarm i core compensator etc paint pallets for ships maybe crossfaction hulls with nerfed stats down to t1 ship specs just ways to soak up excess income into nonbalance affecting valuethe conclusion i had in my acdc threadrant is that the only value in 00 that ccp can sell is fun so if you add style at the top end you can soak up excess wealth and increase fun adding value without doing anything to upset power balances
bpcs doesnt work to have competition invention isnt a mechanic that simulates making new items to out perform your competition its simply another input to production it is economically the same as a tech 2 bpo just with a different barrier to entry and different fixed costs for productionthis is why you need to use bpos because otherwise you will not be creating competition you will just have another production tree to climbthe problem with that is that you have to have dynamic creation of items in the database it could work if your dummy items didnt change stats at all but then all youre doing is adding a name to an item and it definitely would not be easy since youve got to vet and implement new art for all the paint pallets
money supply in eve is tightly controlled with price floors and ceilings as well as isk and item faucets so worrying about that isnt something worth worrying about there will be a general decrease in price levels so long as it doesnt hit the floor since you are adding another good and not adding more moneymoney becomes more valuable prices fallnote if prices rise its because of a quality increase not inflationat the bottom end of the spectrum will still be tech 1 and now tech 2 production tech 1 will be more ultra cheap corp specific stuff except for ships tech 2 bpos will eventually fill the market to the point where they can reasonably be sold on the open market their price continually decreasing as people amass more and more eventually you might need a mechanic to remove them from the game but im not worried about it yet and it should be pretty easy to set up npc buy orders if you want prices above a certain level
so the basic feeling is that hegemony needs to be made more or less impossible in the beginning it seems cap ships were designed as a sponge for wealth the idea being that concentrating your power as a single pilot gains diminishing returns and is harder and harder to maintain since dreads cant receive aid during siege they could be zerged and life should have been goodhowever a couple of things break that mechanic carriers for one via the mechanics of the capital circlejerk just will not die to zerg the dimished returns for each pilot are wholly counteracted by the synergy of this action arguably second relevant mechanic is blinged out nanos with snakes and billion isk mods get on top stay on top an undeniable third mechanic is the titan but i have a feeling thats headed for a nerf on account of its problems in many contexts last as you have addressed so well in your proposal for production the tiny bonuses of highend modules add up quickly so they dont act very well as wealth sponges and instead reinforce the uberness of full faction fitsthese mechanics work to reinforce hegemony because if it takes a lot of t2 ships andor capitals to zerg a few other capitals the victor scoops the loot and the attacker goes home with jack shyt titans obviously make zerg a completely unworkable mechanic for large fightsfor large sov fights there are definitely advantages to going huge and expensive if you wipe the opponent you take few losses and get lots of loot there is definitely a motive for those on top to go for the landslide victoryin the context of regression that route has a further financial load if you regress implants as well you hit pretty much all routes to staying on top and everything requires reinvestment fix carriers and titans and the zerg attacks will return to full effectiveness in stirring the game upcarriers are really simple dreads dont get their industrial sized damage without going into siege where they are vulnerable carriers as well need to require triage for their industrial sized repairs bump up the bonuses on triage modules and reduce repper effectiveness yay for packs of t1 domis zapping carriers into hardenerless suicide capital purges
requiring a carrier to triage in order to rr would go a long way to breaking up capitals onlinetitans should go to capital killers with a big couple million damageor more blast every hour or so and even that would go a long way to killing the rr carrier circle jerkspeed nerf is probably a little harsh what needs to happen is a mechanic by which smaller ships can get under the weaponslaunchers of a larger ship but not so easily run away from the fight not sure how the speed nerf is going to play out it has a long way to gohegemony of the rich and hegemony of the old yes remember there isnt anything you can do to stop hegemony of the many once you fix the problems of hegemony of the rich and old hegemony of the many is the least likely but if all of empire banded together and decided to wipe some 00 entity off the map its not like we could stop it and its not like we should be able toeditwhen taking systems the loot is more defined in 1 high end moons2 the stuff that the enemy doesnt have
at this point i feel its time to show some support for space whalesbut seriously im starting to have hope for 00
speaking as a carebear who will try to get into piracy before january ghost training fiasco i completely disagree with your proposal ive lost ships to my own stupidity and ive enjoyed it many preexisting mmorpgs have worked the model youve defined and some have been ruined by making the introductions youve suggestedwe already have a system for consensual pvp  highsec space and fast ships ccp has already appeased large swathes of players by making concord a guarantee that youll get out safely i disagree with this idea
you have my vote ex i know you will serve eve well will be sry to lose you as ceo but if this is what you want ill support you all the wayrap
extreme we had a probem a long time ago but i think it was a misunderstanding any way i think you would be a good csm rep you will have my vote i was in eye of god at the time any way you have my support for what it is worthi have been paying for about 45 years saxsusdragon power and mrs lacky
i will ask you what i asked the others 1 what do you think were last csm shortcomings2 what do you do when ccp says no and there is nothing to discuss3 what are your passions about the game you must have something you specialize in  that will of course influence your leanings 4 do you think eve is fair do you think eve should be more fair less fair is it fair enough elaborate
once ccp officially published candidates i will start my campaign before that i will take your questions but will answer them once the official campain startsa statement will be made by me once the official candidationlist has been published by ccpim sure this will answer alot of questions beforehandmeanwhile please keep sending your questions these are appreciatedextreme
in a word nobut id say this is because the csm as it was envisioned by both ccp and the player base never actually came to fruitionthe ideaa council of people elected by all the players of eve would offer an unprecedented means through which ccp and eves player base could communicate the most prevailing issues to the player base could be more effectively identified and addressed by ccp then this would lead to a better player experience and a more profitable eve for ccpthe realitya popularity contest was held with nowhere near the population of eve voting and some people got a free trip to iceland then petty rivalry and power tripping between certain players has made it as efficient as a one legged sprinter and when an issue is identified and put before ccp it is usually given lip service treatment at best mostly because the issue was not all that pressing and in all honesty was usually just a petty gripe about eves design at the end of the day things are back to par for the course as the only real winners are forum moderators whom get a new sense of job security as nothing has been fixed and more than ever people are posting about itchange out a few things above and ccp has made a shockingly accurate reinvention of the united states house of representativesthis first round of the csm was not a waste of time it was a learning experience for everyone from ccp to the player base we rolled the dice and saw our system for working the craps table was just flat out wrong and that is all right we try again and we perhaps get some better results next time or we choose to ignore that it is not working and learn its short falls even more which really would be a wasteso here are some of my suggestions to make it better the next time aboutone everyone stays homeyes a free trip to iceland sounds really awesome but ask yourself how serious of a person is it that can drop everything in their life to fly off to the top of the world to debate a video game this requirement basically cuts out the type of person whom makes an ideal csm candidate a responsible one i want to vote for a person whom is highly intelligent knows how to organize things and can deal with obligations in a responsible manner sadly such a person is not free to run for the csm because they have actual career responsibilities family obligations and ambitions in the real world outside the game im sure if being elected to the csm meant only making the time to join a few online video conferences with ccp staff and one another to carry out the responsibilities of their office that they would do it on a weekend but expecting a person like this to maybe give up their one week of vacation a year to sit around with the ccp staff and work out the issues with eve wouldnt happennow let us look at the alternative do you really believe that someone for a fictional world that has the week to spare and zoom off to a foreign nation to basically talk about said fictional game could ever have your best interest in mindfinally for ccps considerationseveral web cams 30 usd eachseveral usb headsets 20 usd each several next day air delivery changes on shipping 15 usd eachone game where the community is represented by better qualified people pricelessplease save the money from air fare and everything else and put it back into developing eve
but what is a better qualified candidate they are one which will ignore what the mob wants and work toward what they need even though the mob has no idea what that is a qualified csm candidate should be able to filter through the assembly hall forums and look at the issues that need attention they shouldnt have to cow tail to peoples christmas wish list of complaints but they should be able to come together and work out why is it an issue what is the under lying cause and mechanic what realistically can the csm suggest to ccp regarding it the csm is an advisory board not a complaint queue so they should spend most of their time as a representative in learning to see the bigger picture of what is actually detracting from the eve player experience not dealing with the flavor of the month being nerfed or a policy change by ccp to eliminate ghost training ccp is a game design company and they seem to have had a little bit of success at it im sure they didnt just decide to annoy the player base by changing this or that lightly so it is pointless for the csm to go over these issues the pros have made their choice the arm chair quarter backs should accept it anything else is a waste of all our timein closing the eve player base needs to lower their expectations of what the csm can do to fix their personal gripes with eves design by a factor of about 260000 they should instead look to have more qualified people represent them and then let them do just that with the belief that the person they elected actually gives a damn about them eve and ccp and wants to make it better for everyone with a reasonable donation to us all of their spare time
from our point of view csm candidates should do a whole lot of work and data gatheringreformatting to present to ccp its a perfectly reasonable demand but why the heck would anyone volunteer for it the pay is crap  nonexistentfrom ccps point of view all suggestions  topics are useless unless theyre triaged and formatted by someone with knowlegde of programming and specifically of how eve is structured and i think that ccp feels the average player cannot get that unless they sit down with a few devs and have things explained and see things for themselves thus perhaps what would be better for the csm is for ccp to get them to iceland as soon as theyre elected train them up  give them all the ndad behind the scenes view and then send them back home and let them do work and submit issues electronicallyin any case theres a lot of work that needs to be done that falls in the realm of telling the playerbase we cant do what youre suggesting in issue x because its just not possible to code with the backbone we haveccp just wants to hear ideas that are technologically compatible with the current code and the playerbase wants feedback on every idea submitted but nobodys doing the work of sorting out and answering the thats impossible cases
i think csm played nice doggie for ccp for the last six months they were largely ineffectual and rolled over for ccp pretty much every single time which is exactly the opposite of what they should be doing just because ccp paid for their trip to iceland their obligation is to the players and not to ccp and i think some of them have forgotten that pretty quickly i just hope next csm grows some balls and gets some teeth because sure as hell ccp needs to answer some questions
is your sole purpose in life to flame and attack the csm and ccp with every word you utterdo you have anything better to do then destroying the hard work these people dopeople who make mistakes just like everyone elseive not seen one post from you today that offered any solutions only insults attacksand deconstructivenegativesyou must be a very very bitter man
its the same problem like with any democracy the ppl you would like to give your vote are not up for election the best what you can get from such an institution whose members have no power whatsoever dont really know what they are talking about and come with their own personal agenda is a nice show and you cant even watch theseif a forum doesnt last out for a company to keep in touch with their player base that company got a real problem the need alone for the csm showes there is something wrong big time maybe it would be best to switch the company sadly nobody got the balls to be competitive when it comes to online games
actually if you do little research you will find that i am very much pro csm and have been from the very beginning i am however quite appalled at how ineffective they have been so if me stating that fact and thus making sure that future csm members are more aggressive with ccp then mea culpa do little research ok the new csm has to be much more forceful than they have been that is what i am pushing at
you cant demand a change of companies you cant even stop a company from making decisionsthe only thing you can do is either keep playing or just flat quitthe quit part means you dont flame or attack you just stop paying for your account and walk awayif enough people do that then youll get there attentionotherwise your just throwing mud and not doing anything productive
excuse me what you suggesting makes no sense ccp was never so onsided before ccp has never been so harsh and inattentive before and i believe that one has to fight for something that one cares about whether is ones country job life or in case of eve a hobby you quit when there is no hope you quit when there is no other way if you think that calling previous csm ineffectual and calling ccp inattentive to their customers  mudslinging in your book then i suggest you reevaluate your personal dictionary if enough people speak the hell up it will get their attention as wellactually you are the one who appears completely dispassionate and nonchalant about the csm i read all your remarks and you appear to be an alt so if anything i would be suspicious of you mate
thank you for proving my pointtootles
how about the game design or informationcommunication technology students running for csm debating video games is what we doim not the only oneschool gives me study points for it i already have 12 extra ects but whatever and it gives me experience that works out for me postgraduation this is my last year if the csm business would have started a year later i probably wouldnt have had the time but until then im all yours youll see when i reveal my secret graduation project at fanfest
fact is csm is good for eve they have done allot but they could have done more i bet you all of them would agree there were too many times when csm were not able to get over themselves and get behind something and really push hard for it at least that is the general impression i get i understand squabbles and i understand disagreements but i am worried that csm as a whole were generally awed by the ccpcsm dynamic to be really effective their first term and give all they got to the players if anything i would reelect them all for a second term now that they have gotten used to the whole thing and see if they would do a better job at it and would cover lack of communication  or perceived lack of communication the lack of ccp customer attunes to their players and a slew of other issues that have been plaguing the ccpplayer base relationship it is people who are passionate about things that usually shine so personally for those who care i would suggest to either vote for the existing csm who have done a good job or for any alt csms who have been through a process and know what the deal is even for darius even though he is a goon and i do not trust him as far as i can throw him  but if you like what he did then keep him in chances are now that they have been around the park they will probably do a better job than before and probably realize what the shortcomings in the process are
absolutely correct its entirely irresponsible of me to spend my free time doing something i enjoy sorry what define intelligent  is there a minimum standard do i need an iq score of 100 what organisational skills do you require csms to have should i have a mba i assume dealing with obligations like taking 5 days holiday to fly to iceland is not what you are talking about when you mention can deal with obligations in a responsible manneri have a career im pretty successful at it imho my family can get by without me for 5 days and i have my rl ambitions which include starting an all electric dixieland band that plays the music of britney spearsi obviously dont exist i obviously dont want to join the csmoh wait i doyes but as we have established already i dont countanyway thanks for your concern ill be sure to send you my iq test results brain scans professional resume bank details medical history family tree credit rating and a live recording of me singing bon jovis living on a prayer at the local karaoke joint so that you can look me over and i can possibly meet your approvaloz i probably wont send you anything but the recording of me singing but im not sure you really want to hear that and i dont want to waste your obviously valuable time
and lots more
look at how stupid the op is
thats nothing its going to get much worse in the next few daysguaranteed
you guys in goonswarm should copyright that remark i have never seen it bandied around to discredit bad as well as good posts until goons came to the game
how does it feel to be a cheerleader at least op is talking and raised some valid points all i see from you are oneliners like you are on stage performing a comedy act or just bumping that certain aspect
is it a crime to agree with a goonoh wait your typecasting and applying stereotypes im sorry i guess i assumed you had the intelligence and rationality to look beyond thatill have to watch what i say in the future thenepic fail
no actually it is not even though i do not like goons in general i find myself agreeing with many of them quite often well we can leave the herd behaviour out of it for a moment i do think it is a crime to pretend not to have an opinion which what you seem to have shown in your last couple of posts just posting a quip and glib remark does not cut it i personally want to hear what you think  rather than a quote of something relatively amusing and you know why i want to know what you think even though you are a complete stranger to me because i think that for the most part part last csm was not very effective because i think this is last time i will give csm idea benefit of the doubt and i want to see how they do on the second session and because i think it really affects everyone in game including you so do not pretend to be an idiot and actually give your opinion out
for me to express my opinion in such terms you could understand would be a waste of my time not to mention everyone elseyou already made your mind up your beating your war drumwhy bother
i dont think that is correctad 3 afaik ganged storyline missions will only give a faction gain to the person that acceptsreturns the mission the others will just gain personal and corp standingsad 2 this is not correct verified with a friend ingame as soon as you have 2 faction or corp or personal standing you wont be able to use any related agent no matter what your other standings are eg 2 amarr standings  5 kador family standings  no kador family agents available or in general unable to use any amarr empire agents no matter what corp  personal standings you haveso basically empire factions work the same as pirate factions i would have been very surprised if there would have a differenceas soon as you reach 2 faction standings the only chance as it is now is to get derived faction standings by running important missions for a faction that is liked by your screwed factionassembly hall issuestuck faction standingsold thread locked eliminate stuck faction standings
afaik this isnt true unless it changed fairly recentlyhow much is a set of full snakesslavescrystalsits because doing missions is hard in low sec 00 once you add in the fact that most people totally ruin their pirate faction standings mine are all like 10 we cant do anything in 00 for missions the even worse fact is that when u do missions for them your standing with empires drop quick and often make it impossible to return to high sec which is bad because most people who go out to 00 eventually make their way back to high sec for whatever reason
ccp are slow as hell more news at 11
i agree
add the skill queue cos logging in for 4 seconds does sod all for game play
having no skill queue is really silly it always has been for someone who works 13 hour days getting skills done when i want them to without a queue is a huge pain i dont like having to babysit multiple accounts on my hours off just to keep skills training
signedeve is big enough now this is an idea that deserves a place at least 3 to 5 skill queue

they already are they do not destroy wreckssmartbomb damagerofcap is all finebut capital and range are very bad ideas with faction and officer weapons they are already very powerful giving carriers a cheap factionofficer alternative and a range bonus on top of that is simply unacceptableall you would be doing is changing the supply line factiondeadspaceofficer sbs are already capital class smartbombs the production method is simply not as player driven as the player buildable itemsnow it is possible to create player buildable capital class items which have the proper cost as to be nontrivial when fitting carriers and be limited to capital class ships but you would need either a monopoly type system or rolling monopoly type system in order to get that done
need overhaul
agreed smarties need more skills dabout capital smartbombs taking out citadel torps what about giving the capital smartbombs a longer reactivation rate too have a few holes where you can squeeze in your missilesmaybe not much more dps then large smartbombs but a lot higher burstalpha
like i said earlieruntil the smartbomb is changed from emitting from the edge of the entire ship to the center point then i can support capital smartbombs but as long as they are as current a smartbomb on a capital is already just that a capital smartbombnow for accessory skills yes i can agree there needs to be more of thatincrease damage energy use reductionnot for rapid refire as smartbombs current skill should stay as is that of a refire durationand not for smartbomb range as was stated earlieri dont want to get into giant overhaul buffnerfreworkings rather i would like to see just a small tweakbut you get my lil support thumb on this because thats what ccp will look atmaybe a variant of the current smartbombs longer range for smaller dmg
i absolutly agree they are in dire need for an overhaul
something needs to be done giving bombs to stealth bombers just hasnt given them a role as it stands atm
big yes please
nerdiest thing i watch its awesome
full 200 support
omg yes 100 gogogo i want it asap plz
i want my eve tv
sure if they get new staff to host it
you fail gone the staff were great and funny bring evetv back
supported
i think you failed to see posts from me almost from page one there m8
originally by evangaas i read this you dont know you can jump from out of high sec to low sec ccp could build in a restriction of not being able to jump from high sec to high sec my point is to be able to jump from low into high sec nothing more periodall that was asked for is the ability to jump from low to hi sec not hi sec to hi sec
curently ecm isnt stacking paneltized so runining mulpiple ecm on 1 target gives great results without stacking panelty targets even with 2 eccm are jammes 50 of time  relock time so bs will shoot like 1 time per minute ecm should get stacking panelty
ecm is chance based and does not stack so it does not have a stacking penaltyif you activate your first ecm it does not reduce the resistance the target ship has to the second ecm you use if it fails
i should have been clearer on that sorry what i meant was make the underlying model tuned to react to how players move the market say they determine here is what supply or demand for a product can be sustained by the npc corporations if the human trading market violates that by some percentage the npc corporations buying or selling of the commodity collapsesi would imagine it works out like thiswheat has a demand figure of 005 so for a rule the supply of wheat that the npc trade goods market could handle in a given day would might figured out like 05 x 15 and from there you say no more wheat could be supported by the market then yesterdays supportable amount  75 so if the human market pushes wheat supply in the market above or below that we get a bubble forming that may become a crash what forms a boom would have to be looked into more carefully another generic formula could be applied the same way for the figure of supportable priceso ccp would not have to constantly watch the market as the model of the market has a boundry built into it does that makes sense
i simply threw back at you what you threw at meive helped developed real time charting applications of market prices those are much more complicated then this and you can get that with just a graphing api and javascript in a web browser most of the things to do this from what i see are all ready in the eve system the market history and charts the market table all this really requires if it is kept simple is a new window in the game client like the markets so basically a browser view a database on the server side and the coding to allow the deduction and addition to characters accounts and items all that is needed after that is to develop the application that manages this and updates the database based on the market
i think that leads back to what i see has a problem for the eve economy in how moon mining and research and production are done though i can see the merits of it this way but it takes away from the asset holding mechanic and also does not allow a steady liquidity to build up with the market for assets
failedhow about posting something other than stupid with your main
planetary assets certainly sound interesting id need to see the idea fleshed out much more to support it thoughim 100 against ccp created stock markets they should be player run ccp is there to provide basic tools to allow players to create things not hold our hands in the scary universe
where is the riskthe asset cant be lost taken blown up and can be held by an alt that never leaves the stationif you really wanted to push this it needs risk like a pos can be blown up can the asset be taken by force why not restrict the asset with corp faction standingsbiggest problem i see is the asset with no risk of loss its the same idea as why ccp doesnt have a ingame faction bond as any form of a guaranty could hurt economy
personally i think planet interaction should be done a little different at the moment in highsec there are moons with poses all over them i would propose that given the right standing and enough isk you could move your pos to planetslets say you need an 80 with faction to buy landyou also need an 80 with the corp that has a station around the planetadd a new station server  planet managementyou need an office on the stationyou also need an office on the planetyou buy up pos mods like labs etc and install them on the planeteach mod raises the planet office rental up so no one could just throw 50 labs down but they could if they had the iskuse the stations interface to interface with the mods you have on the planet planet mods like ammo ships components etc are done at a 95 material needs to cheapen it a little over the pos anything made on the planet is deposited into the corp hanger at the stationpirategriefers will turn that down as the corporations assets are nonattackable so its not the most perfect idea but i tell you give people an unlimited pos like this the database will clean up real quickhowever the only time highsec poses really fall under attack is if they are at war war could be personal could be contracted doesnt matter the fact is not many poses in highsec get blown up just for fun too expensive to attack takes too long etc so really i cant see any difference between a highsec pos and moving all the mods to a planet with an interface instead of a pos helps ccp and the users who can afford it out more then anything else
i like the moving poses to planets approach presented by sencnes thereim also dreaming of an endgame element where people could buy really expensive planetary assets of the sort that couldnt really be used to make profit but that would give all sorts of bragging rights and epeen benefits that would attract people mansions with cool graphics would be one obvious thing and heres another idea a bit more unusualplayers could pay a large amount of isk to become a mayor of a large city and they could invest additional isk to various projects that would make their citizens happy various cool competitive scoreboards could be included but the major epeen element that would motivate players would be getting loyal npc followers  these would be npc citizens that have become really impressed and admiring of the billionaire benefactor of their city and could visually present themselves in space as small npc fleets cruising their home system and in various ways flying the flag of their benefactor for all to seewho wouldnt pay tons to have a fleet of 10 npcs cruising jita in cool ships flying your colors for all to seeand competitive scoreboards of who has how many loyal npc followers on which planet and in which star system would be really cool the few ones actually flying npc ships could be just a tip of the iceberg another cool element would be the followers of various players competing as political parties on their planetsthis system could be expanded in all sorts of cool ways like people sabotaging each others mayorships and so on there could be an entire simcity subgame but the major initial elements would be1 getting a couple of cool npc ships cruising around their highsec system advertising the greatness of their generous benefactorleader2 the mayorship system should be such that it couldnt be used to make isk it would cost a lot and people could perhaps liquidate their positions for 80 of original investment or something like that but in no event could they make large isk profits even though they were paying a lotone expansion would be utilizing these npcs to run missions as your companions but the isk costs should be very large compared to this benefit so it would essentially be done only for the coolness of it
the risk is constant price exposure on the assets commodity if you spend a billion isk to develop an asset and are paying the taxes and upkeep based on that but the market has a meltdown for the commodity it produces that is very high risk also if you cannot pay the upkeep the asset loses value cannot pay the taxes it is foreclosed i all ready did suggest that the ability to buy an asset be tied with faction and corp standing i dont think requiring an asset to be outright destroyable like a pos is needed or feasible as that would require ccp putting changes into eve for ship on planet activity
im always disappointed in skills that dont serve a purpose at all skill levels jury rigging 5 battleship construction 13 and 5 etc for battleship construction and all other construction skills id like to see a reduction in production time per level 5 per level would be reasonable so id saycapital construction 5 reduction in capital shipmodule production time per levelbattleship construction 5 reduction in battleship production time per levelcruiser construction 5 reduction in battlecruiser production time per levelindustrial construction 5 reduction in industrialtransport production time per levelfrigate construction 5 reduction in frigate production time per leveloutpost construction 5 reduction in outpost platform production time per leveli really dont think that this would have a significant affect on the market and would make sinking sp into these skills a little less annoying
well 25 less time is 25 more production so its probably quite a large increase in market saturation however i do think those skills ough tot have some use its very poor design that they do nothingperhaps a smaller bonus eg 2 per level
agreed no skill level should ever be useless im not sure what effect they should have though your proposal seems sensible but they should have an effect
sure i am voting yes just to see this idea shut down and killed by ccp in about 15 seconds dont get me wrong i think it is sensible thing to ask i am certain however that ccp will veto this wo any discussion from csm so yes just to see ccp exercises their veto power and unless they will pull the sorry it will disrupt our database shtick he he he
aye
vote
even if ccp gets a boost of income now it will result in a loss of income in the long term assuming each player has 3 accounts made up  after ccp gets their bonus they get 13 of their previous income
nofirstly no other mmo does allow parallel training as you have suggested you need to log off one character to log the other on and train thus you can only train one character at oncejust like eveit will also promote character farming which i dont really agree with either
i dont support this as it will only crash the char market let this one lie i understand the mob is out with torch and pitchforks from ghost training im with you on that problem but the fact is 1 char 1 training time infact i would like them to fix the ability to set a toon to train a long skill transfer that char to another account and then let that char train simultanously as the other char that was training already on the account
i agree with this since the beginning of year ccp have made bad choices for the gamers getting rid of 90 day gtc and 30 day gtc wich majer increase in sales for 60 day gtc and the ghosting is a good idea but has its bad ideas and then nano nerf same again good and bad which i dnt think is taking place and other things that have stopped us from having fun and making us isk farme all the time this is needed for people to come back or stay in the game
this everyone who is supporting this is obviously not engaging their brains
this is a terrible idea and not only is it a terrible idea but the rationale used to support it is terrible too  it would do the exact opposite of a b would seem to be exactly the sort of cash grab players owuld thoroughly despise and i really couldnt care less about the type of envious whiners youre holding up in c on the bright side i can safely assume itll never happen
bolded the reason why its a ty idea also the cost of skillbooks for most things is trivial
sorry to say but this is a really bad ideain some mmos this may work but not evewhats to stop me creating an industrial alt that can fly hulks jump freighters rorquals etc etcand all you gotta do once youve trained a character is transfer it to a new account and youve got a character that you basically havent paid for i think ccp would sooner bring back ghosting tbhmaybe a split training an equal  to each slot with a skill running but not this not signed xailz
bad idea they made it this way for a reason its not going to change
im not good at spelling but ill ty and do my bestso my account has been in active for 35 days now for the simple fact gtcs have leapt a high price and are still raising if you looked a few weeks ago they were 400500 mill now they have creept to 500600 mill now the avergae smart gtc payer doesnt want to spend the isk on a gtc so people like me ask for one at a resonable price 450500 mill but the sellers have got greedy and started selling them at 500 and are sticking to that i looked at the timecode bazzar other day and sore there are way more gtc wtb than there is wts and sellers carnt keep up when we had all the gtcs sellers had a more choice if they didnt have alot of cash they would buy a 30 and then a 60 if they had enough and so on but now if the sellers havent the cash they carnt buy the 30 so they dont buy at all  less wts and more wtb wich is causing a problem as the fact that ghosting is going to be banned the time it takes to get a gtc will run into your account expired which leads to all stop on training wich will lead to the buyers thinking ahh what the hell i cba any more with this which is less sellers and buyersless cash for greedy ccp or marketing sidenow i suggest ccp return to the marketing side of them and ask are you sure this was the right ideas im sure you are loosing more money than your making and the fact that they thought 60 day were the future to soon must have crippled the game a lot i suggest bringing the 30 and 90 day gtc back would be the best idea for ccp now to keep there players and keep getting moneyi now this has been mentioned loads of times but i would suggest everyone post there thoughts maybe i am wrong if so tell me now plzo and i no people have been saying iski farmers are a biggest problem for ccp right now but are you sure that is a problem for ccp i mean think about it as long as they are still paying for the accounts and ccp are getting money from them why ban them its a exploit that ccp have found they said they would take action all i have seen is buffing the isk farmer problem not nerfing it all they need to do is ban the odd one and say we are doing our best and they get away with easy cash and no problems
obviously if gtc sellers are selling at that price people are buying them at that price supply and demand my friend and if you feel like its not worth 600mil to keep yourself in game for 2 months then go spend real money
or quit and save me the hassle alltogether each way is good tbh 
if youre not willing to pay the cash and youre not willing to pay the isk so that somebody else will pay the cash then thatd probably be your best solution ccp doesnt do this for free nor should they
according to ctrl  f there were a grand total of 3 periods in that entire walloftext granted i cant be assed to try to decipher it im just going to say the op needs to learn what supply and demand is and needs to get a job
i support this initiative but i doubt itll have any impact just look at the 30 90 day gtc removal a while back all we asked for was giving up the options even if we paid the new higher price and ccp still ignored it if you manage to get them to change ghost training itll renew my faith in the csm you do a great job dont get me wrong but ccp doesnt seem to listen to the more sensitive issues
this i have no expectation that they will reverse their decision but it would be nice to get an apology for the way we were treated and an assurance that the lesson has been learned and the error will not be repeatedccp its your game shape it how you want but just dont bull us about it ffs the bald unpleasant truth is a hundred times less provocative than a stupid obvious lie
assuming we cant get it back id like  sorry we lied to you  well give you a couple of months notice if we ever do anything like this again  well go and make you a skill training queue now for fks sake
the funny thing is that we can basically see how useful csm really is on this topic alone ccp does what ccp wants and doesnt care what the csm does
well id like to see a converter for mineralsit taking 2 tritanium and sort of bpc or device and cooking 1 pyeriteor taking 2048 tritanium and bpc and making 1 zydrinethis is due to some minerals could be missing in certain locations and converting them into each other will make prices more stable the same true for moon mineralsand one more thing if bpc is just a paper why not to fax it to certain station could npc corp offer a sort of faxpostal service
your first idea would wreck every market in eve and your second one would change a few things pretty dramatically  most notably utilization of lowsec research stations and logistics for 00 groups also its a bit simplistic  blueprint can just as easily include scale models and prototypes which cant be faxed
it wouldnt wreck markets it would just provide new price ceilings and floors as once a mineral became too expensive it would be converted into anotherwould do the same thing for moon minerals
true wreck would be a shortterm thing it would drastically change them however and remove a large part of the complexity in the current markets which i regard as a bad thing

the proposed cure is worse than the disease
supported ludicrous speed has got to go but the proposed changes are a complete disaster
would definitely like to see some actual thought put into the consequences of the current change rather than just tihnking about the actual change itself examples include blasters autocannons battleship mobility interceptor survivability hac usefulness compared to t1 bc as well as missile laser and drone balancetheres been almost no attempt to preserve balance of other parts of the game while balancing nano no thought put in
support of the op ludicrous speeds is whats need nerfing not a complete gamechange to make the game static and guerrilla warfare a joke
i propose this because i am in part not convinced that stability of supply and therefore price is either realistic or desirable the present system has limited supply  as the real life situation with oil demonstrates when demand begins to come very close to supply the price will shoot upas youd expect this will cause the needed reduction in demand  as well as causing increases in the prices of all t2 components made with that mineralby inventing a mechanism to add supply when a moon is exhaused another is added ccp could choose to increase supply by quietly increasing the number of new moons supplying technetium or whatever without telling anyoneas for your small holders and alliances all of them are at risk of being drafted into one side or the other of the major alliances wars the mechanism is simple  join as our ally and supplier or be conqueredi think small holders would be better served if valuable moons were constantly being discovered  this would reduce the value of the moon mineral databases the majors maintainthe probabilistic method of finding minerals would also mean that even if someone other than the moons current tenant probed it there is no assurance that what the current tenant is mining is what the character doing the probing has found thus uncertainty is increased and other corps have less reason to conquer that moon  they dont know what theyd get and without the right certificate cant get it anywaythis would tend to protect the small holders and alliances from arbitrary exercise of power by the big boys
i like it
limited resources on moons means that mining pos no longer become a valuable target for operations especially since you cant know how long you will be able to produce forall you would end up doing is having everyone put pos on all moons after generating the certificate that they wantend effect1 less conflict over moons2 more pos as moon mineral wealth is spread out3 moon scanning becomes tedium as each scanner will be looking for 95 confidence in material composition4 increased logistics as pos have to be moved when resources dry upthat is 4 negative effects and no positive effects
this would be too much of an imbalance to the game not supported even though i would love to see it from a pew pew perspective
current state of affairsoften someone either randomly goes through systems scaning and opening plexes and never gets back to them for whatever reason up to and including getting blown up before they enter the plex or a group of defensive plexers will flip a system uncontested and one two or more plexes remain open and visible on the overviewdefenders get no points for closing a plex in an uncontested system and defensive plexing is bloody boring enough as it is however leaving them open gives an advandage to the next wouldbe attacker that comes alongproposalif a fw plex in an uncontested system is opened but no one starts the timer on it the plex should disappear from the overview after a set amount of timedespawning the plex probably isnt necesicary but the possability should probably be looked at by the design team and either considred or rejected depending on their evaluation
ive already put the spawning mechanics on the agenda and will add your specifics to my document
forums ed up on me today didnt let me post to the thread i hoped forplease delete
what have you accomplished as far as ingame changes and are there any pending changes that you have brought forth yourself that you are able to speak about
dear jinx here come my answers 1 csm being bunniesas i have been receiving most of the communications between ccp and csm i can ensure you that the first csm was not as evasive as your impression based on the forum might show unfortunately they were not allowed to disclose their complete communication with ccp see eula but i can ensure you they squeezed a lot more proper answers out of ccp than what ccp originally answered you also have to understand that csms options are limited csm in in no position to make ccp do anything as csm cannot fire ccp nor take their money as for what i would be doing about it continue the modest pressure csm has been putting on ccp even that we did not communicate this very well and hope that there will be a better turnup on the next election as the csms power depends on community support and community support can be best expressed with the participation on the elections 2 duplicate of the first questionsee answer to first question apart from that i would be working for the community and if ccp tried not to deal with it i would rerequest an answer and ask for a better explanation if ccp does not want to deal with a topic they can veto it so it does not get on the agenda at all so if they already agreed on an item to be open for discussion i feel that it is completely okay to push them as long as they say something acceptable definition of acceptable differs from person to person as for me i usually stop asking when i get the feeling that the peer is simply not able to provide a better answer in the time available for replying but go back to the topic at a later time 3 csm and player communicationi agree with you communication between the playerbase and the csm could have been a lot better if i get elected i will try to improve it as in the end csmplayerbase communication is the reason why csms achievements is not perceived at all by most of the players leading to questions like most of yours 4 musical instruments and destroyers of evei personally like musical instruments i think eve deserves more musical instruments i had the chance to step into a place of a csm rep when the topic was on agenda and i definitely supported it as for the other part of the question i trust individuals not groups of players i do trust people by default until they do something to lose my trust 5 fairnessthere are nothing thats completely fair eve isnt an exception its not fair either i do value fairness however it is not something that can be descibed easily if eve would strain for total fairness then new players would have same chances as old players and everyone was flying in the same ships using the same modules having the same skills an there would be no thing like money and assets well i definitely do not want eve to become so fair but i do think that players in similar situation similar age having invested similar amounts of time and money and effort into the game should have equal chances
helloi am happy to announce my application to the csmif i am elected my focus would be the the little guy those folks that remain independent or part of small corporations i have a definite industrial focus but see that there is also a lot to be said about the fighting side of eve i had created a statement before some of the recent anouncement medals and market inprovements for example but have left my thoughts about them in my statement you can look at that i had provided when i applied atissler dainze csm statementill try and closely monitor this thread and respond to any comments or questionsthanks for taking the time to read this and hope i can interact with many of you in the days to comeissler dainzeceo tadakastu obata corporationfounder of the honda accordnote i have not received a response to my application yet from ccp but i expect it is in order does anyone know when they are going respond to the applications
i havent received a reply either so youre not alone i imagine it will probably be sometime next weekalso i want to wish you luck i read your statement and it seems quite interesting i hope we have the chance to serve together
why thank you garion i look forward to some interesting discussions and i also wish you the best of lucki see some candidates have choosen to reveal that they actively play that mmorpg game called rl i admit i have dabbled in that game and would be willing to describe the toon i made when i started playing i find a lot of pilots i encounter in eve play rl regularly some play too much for my tastes in fact if it is important to enough people i will be glad to tell you more about michele my female tech worker toon that i play on the seattle server maybe some of what i do when i play rl is relevant if you think it is ask away and id be glad to tell you moreto be honest though i find rl to have some serious design flaws the leveling system is terrible and some aspects of the game mechanics leave a lot to be desired it doesnt take long for me to be tired of the limiting enviroment come on rl developers shouldnt we have the flying cars and life on the moon expansions you have been promising for decades by now and man talk about some sorry looking avatars so anyways ill gladly answer any question you might have even if it has to be about that dumb rl game some of us play i hope however that most of the conversations will be about the realities we face right here in the eve universe we face some big challenges and i hope i can find a way to help us all find our place in this great big verseissler
industry lowsec and roleplay oh myive been thinking lately thinking about what i think could be better about this game i figured that now that we have this csm maybe i should tell my ideas to them and then i realized that the csm elections were coming soon maybe i should not only present some ideas to the csm  maybe i should run for the csm after all we have two expansions coming that focus on things that i have ideas about  even if my ideas wouldnt make it into those expansions its a good time to raise them when topics of industry and roleplay are brought into the spotlightso here i am running for electionlet me tell you a little bit about myselfin eve my primary jobs are to be an industrialist a diplomat and an administrator  i run a corp take part in alliance leadership and administer a mutual nap treaty between several alliance and a number of corporations in several lowsec systems my hobbies include mission running racing exploration and pvp and i also spend quite a bit of time roleplaying and immersing myself in the eve universe my alt thulla icin is a member of eve university a corporation that teaches newer players more about eve and helps them find their feet in this gamein real life i have served on the student senate in college which i believe is an experience that will be of great value in preparing me to represent the players of this game to ccp in the student senate i helped represent the concerns and issues of the student body to the college administration  now i shall help represent the concerns and issues of the players to ccp and any of my fellow senators can tell you that i am an asset to any meetinglet me also say a little about my ideasmy slogan is industry lowsec and roleplay oh my which should give an indication of the kinds of things i intend to focus on  though i hardly intend to exclude other issuesin regards to industry i feel that we must make sure that our attention to industry includes not only something for those who produce the goods but those who use them  the combat players changes to industry will affect them as well and we should be sure we have input from the consumer  and new things for industrialists to make means new things for combat players to use and destroyi also believe lowsec needs a boost recently we had an update the empyrean age which made lowsec a battleground for the forces of factional warfare what we have not seen however is meaningful improvements to low security space that would give nonpvp oriented players more of a reason to spend time in lowsec offering rich industrial oriented rewards in lowsec would be good both for those brave and cunning enough to exploit its riches  and for the pirates who prey upon the less cunningfinally the coming of ambulation puts the immersion aspect of eve into the spotlight while i understand that this is not important to everyone it is very important to a number of players and i suspect that while it is not the most important aspect of the game for the majority of players i think the majority would agree that it adds something to the game i intend to be an advocate for this aspect of the game while keeping efforts balanced with other aspects of game development and ensuring as always that there is something for everyone to enjoy  more events for example that will lend a sense of immersion for those to whom it is important but that might still offer some interesting combat  or interesting rewards  for those less interested in immersionif you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask i have a blog for the election that can be found here please tell your friends i hope that you will support me but regardless of who you vote for i encourage you to get involved find out about the candidates and votethank you
i think you can count on the festival for this one gvote garrion vote for lowsec
thanks my friendhmm    that could be a good slogan a vote for garion is a vote for lowsec i may have to make some sigs with that on them

okay meeting 11 is delayed again at 1500 hours we had jade constantineomber zombielavista vista tusko hopkins ank dierdra val we waited 1 hour for a 7th delegatealternate darius johnson arrived at 1600 to make it 7 but since omber had to leave in 30mins we concluded that the meeting wasnt going to work in the 30min slot therefore were going to do something a little different this week  and all the issues on the agenda will be voted on offline in the csm discussion forum mondayfriday  and well minute the commentsdiscussionvotes for next weeksorry about the delay again but we appreciate everyone has a busy life and sometimes even csm delegates and alternates have trouble making these meetings each week all the best
i tried to make it back from real life stuff but the gods intervened car problems anyway its a pity more of the csm members didnt show for the meetingbut at least it gives a chance for the csm forum to be used for voting etca quick question how will meeting logs assuming forum dicussion on issues and voting be reported to the playerbase for this methodalso alternates at least me in any case has no access to the csm forum as yettake carearithron
i was thinking about what you said about gs zerging likewise in the event of a fast t1 or t1esque production chainwhile gs would benefit from this tactic and obviously enjoy the hell out of it as would i its not hegemony of the rich or hegemony of the old that would be operating but hegemony of the many which weve already stated isnt something that can or should be removedsecond of all fast t1 production works to level the 00 warfighting field t1 ships are easier to fly at max or near max skills so getting zerged back doesnt really advantage the old all that much when it comes to capital ships and t2 ships if the zergly production chain cant manufacture them then that advantage is going to wear thin over the course of a warbattle as welllastly while the effects on an extended battle are rather obvious we have to ask is this not what we want should pilots not fly ships time after time though large battle may begin to resemble a giant rts game with some people flocking around in one constellation running a production system and another group trying to ninja the opponents local production operation all while fighting a huge as battle or series of battles in nearby systems how can this possibly be a bad thingso while the system will advantage the rich and old as much as it advantages the new the fact that the rich and old have to take the same route to utilizing it pretending to be poor and young would in fact have a leveling effect across the galaxynow for how to not affect the t1 system or at least keep from tearing massive holes in the economy
the reason i was mentioning it as a possible problem were twofold1 t1 production means cutting into t1 producers profits this can be fixed2 zergy production chains benefit entities that are better able to protect them more there is an efficiency advantage for space holders in this respect not saying its a bad idea but it is not one that necessarily will benefit the small guy
the way im looking at a potential solution is to make it the kind of thing that evaporates the first time someone shoots it and fails to be productive without pilots in the system no stability and no passive value from minerals to final products no step can run for more than a few hours minutes maybe even without some inputshortening the time interval would create the pos effect similar to having to run all over the galaxy to deliver fuel limiting the ability of one individual to run a gigantic system however while people are in system and micromanaging things production is through the roof small volume increments of high value stuff that fills up a very small silo or bay would be desirable i thinkhave a question about your last post going to ask it in a very uneducated way on purposeif a system requiring stability benefits alliances and a zergy system also benefits alliances what doesnt tip things in favor of the oldi guess when were talking about the hegemony of the oldestablished it boils down to the things that allow a twoyear old 00 alliance advantages over a similarly skilled and directed twoday old 00 allianceto keep that level of the action stirred up all thats probably necessary are paths for day one to get a solid enough footing to have offline presence and production goingin the event that sov goes to a planetary system there will end up being more slots open or weakly defendednot cared about at moons for alliances to set up shop if the pos is given some measure of offline presence albeit nonpermanent and vulnerable to getting steamrolled and bubbled into ashes a fully fleshed out production system is all an aspiring alliance would need to make the move to 00 on any day of their choosingin my current situation those are the only two things i want for my corp if we can produce ships and modules have some other sources of income to get stocked up for war and keep from getting scanned down and blown to hell were fine we can find a system with the right location and political situation we can beat enough people to win some breathing room thats really all we need to get started in 00everything after that would depend upon our ability to build successes into momentum and avoid costly engagements while trying to disrupt our target system holders economic activity to get them weakened and overexposed next comes system sov and maybe outposts etc etc
almost nothing the issue here is a nonlinear advantage given to larger alliances now i was not saying that the mechanic proposed would necessarily do that just that its something you have to be careful of to understand what might or might not add to the power of current power blocks lets first start with corporations in the real world when corporations become big their influence in small areas of the economy dwindlesusually the answer is not because they are too unwieldy to partake in those endeavors but because the amount of capital they have is enough that they would not be able to utilize all of it if they went in that direction such small corporations can spring up and pick up the slackoftentimes with the larger buying a portion of the smaller if the large corporation in its own entity were to go into the niche markets they would have to create an extra layer of bureaucracy to deal with coordinatingin eve that extra level of bureaucracy is unnecessary alliances are more likely to operate like oligopolies where there is a loose association based on some common ground geography in eve and production type in the real world this means they gain all the efficiency bonuses of noncompetition and none of the downsides of increased overhead to deal with coordinating everythinggs works this way we have ops and generalized directives and subsidies but for the most part you dont have to go on any ops and the subsidies and directives only serve to inform those who arent where the best profit opportunities are then we all benefit from the lack of violent competition between us and go have funbecause of this the advantages that you can glean for most cooperative actions rather than increasing linearly increase exponentiallywhere n 1 and because of this power is pushed more towards those who already own the space and have already gotten the noncompetition agreements in placemechanics that buck this are mechanics that increase linearly in power which can pretty much only be personalnot exclusively but closea system by which people can produce close to the front might be better for the little guymore likely for the aggressor since they allow an attacker to reduce his logistics chainwhich is especially important for someone who doesnt have a logistics chain more likely for a small guy than a bug guy but its still something that has to be looked at carefullyi think it would be better to limit the number you could use per system make their production require no logistics but have the resources produced fill up a small bay and stop when the bay was filled so there was a rate at which you could produce but a max amount that could be in reserve at any one timeare there really enough people wanting to get into 00 that cant or is your corp one of the few to really make a dent i think you need to have make individual production much higherand dense as to lure more people into the space
lol wellbeing that i enjoyed clones without having standings ratting up a few hundred mil on a moments notice dodging gate camps the increased market opportunity for a trader having stations yes im more than ready to get back to 00ive basically only lived in 00 and still havent adapted to empire life im a mission noob and feel like rambo getting paid to work a carnival shoottheclownwithawaterpistol game yeah i can still make money trading and pretty much everything in front of me melts in missions but its boring its dreadfully boring it feels like every other godawful mmo and i cant understand why there isnt an exodus happening in five minutes with twenty thousand pilots carving up a huge free trade zonein fact i dont actually have a clone in empire right now im like a homeless wanderer in 00 with skills and cash learning to solo regional economies because im not civilized enough to fit into empire lifei go around in empire and im like a sheep in a grassmunching frenzy sheep and wool flying everywhere and everyone trying to shear as much off their own backs as possible entire pastures turned to dust and still there they are scraping around for roots thousands of sheep sitting in the homeless line at the mission runners desk for a free meal because theres nothing to be had in empirethis is purely my own selfish view but could we please turn empire off its a disaster a fing disaster and im glad i came to empire because its been an eyeopening experience this is what people have been doing since i left after a month of off and on missioning in a catalyst and getting blown up in thoraxes by any random lachesis i thoughti thought that people would move onim in a position now to lead a tiny band of fresh blood out of this disaster with skills in hand to turn them all into expert nomads and zerglings in no time and save them from this disaster by and by i have come to understand why people think eve is such a dark game and also why im thinking of myself almost as a humanitarian to do something about it
assuming nandeyanen is nande yanen i was asking whether or not many people were wanting to get into 00 rather than just a few
yeah thats my go help noobs in npc corp alti dont know what the proportion is no idea really i dont understand how it could possibly be too low i think a lot of people lack the experience needed to know just how shy empire life is that and the clear direction you see yourself in a tiny corp or a tiny alliance and arent sure and have a few bad tastes from the experience of getting pawned at the hands of a megathron rr gang with barely 850k spwhat is probably in far shorter supply than workable mechanics are simply good leaders and recruiters who can put together a smoothly running corp and find it a good alliance for a homewhatever barriers to finding the drive to move to 00 exist are probably more mythical in nature than not ill find out soon
i think it has a lot to do with the fact that individuals can make as much money in empire after grinding up standings as they can in 00pretty much after the risk
true that i have no great standings and desire no further standings still is the game about achieving a huge level of bling or having fun thats something i cant understand at allhow do all these empire ppl get rid of their isk give it to the pirates and nanogangs i dont understand that at all there is no level 70 stop grindinganywayfor sprucing up 00 we need more income and spacebling back to the whole idea of putting stuff at the top and at the end of the rainbow darius was pretty dead on when he said theres really not much to go for in 00 once youve blown up and put down enough space sticks you get a flag youre done sure youre rich you have outposts that look like every other outpost but then whatcheck this idea outsay that these new spacerock planet eaters or whatever produce two kinds of goods the first is useful for the production of all sorts of zerg friendly goods that are needed to support an upandcoming war effort and quickly bounce back when the fire blows over the second is used for the followingalliance named goods yes dear ep33n they go from meta to faction and require the alliance ticker in order to fit it an additional fitting stat that just checks if youre in alliance have to melt it down or sell it back when looted using dummy database entries as i was going for earlierfaction crossfaction and pirate ships several flavors available and built in with the regression system mk iv mk i is a lowstat version thats probably closer to a tier i ship and has fewer slots but hey its really cool looking and probably has neat bonuses mk v is the uber expensive faction ship that soaks up wealth and removes it by getting zerged but were all rich so people will build themimplants of all kinds also built into the regression system and requireing some kind of cool invention system archeology etc can be used to pick up technology from all these cool pirate factions and leftover jovian crapnew alliance structures that are neat landmarks cooler stations capital structures etc etc exclusive access and having their own environments once we get to the whole ambulation thingmodular finite and nonlinear database entries and customizable new artwork with support for pallets structures for everything from towers to stargates maybe not the little stuff but definitely the big eyecandy partsmonumental structures that can be anchored at unused gravity wells limited purpose but what the hell its cool eh coolness has value construct a monument to a special occasionmethods for defacement and destruction that require appropriate levels of pvp pwnage accomplishmenta neat side effect is that if you cant process the stuff you sell it and get isk that you need to get more capitalized whenever a large battle is lost that had a lot of zerg production involved theres probably a stack of the highend assets in store somewhere that you might be able to capture and convert into spacebling to commemorate the win yes smart players will dump it out into space and let it pop or ferry it home when things go bad but occasionally this loot pile will get captured and there will be much rejoicing
two things1 a lot of the people producing in empire play in lowsec and 00 people who make enough money to pvp off of are rare its impossible for everyone to make enough money to pvp off of someone has to lose out i know i cant do it even if i didnt donate my proceeds absent communistic organization people need to make moneythey do this in empire because empire is the easiest and safest way to make cash many players will have jump clones or alts in empire that in a time of low war declaration they can jump back to and run missions this is less true in gs but certainly true the other thing you have to understand is that there is a lot of bling that can go around faction fit cnr will set you back a pretty penny up that to an officer fit cnr and its even more people play just to finish that line viewing level 70 as maxed skills with a faction fit same concept different means of attaining it a lot of people do the same but with carriersdeadsmotherships being their ideal ship and so like anything else they grind to itdarius is right in that there is nothing to do once you reach the top but as a game that is just going to be something we have to accept what other end game content can there be in wow its a loot grind in eve its a loot grind that is why eve stands out as a pvp game because once youre on top its about staying on top people end up playing for the experience and not for the grindregarding your specific idea all that is well and good but aside from the research input good you can just use minerals the production method doesnt need to be created anew the research input good needs to be separate so you can more easily balance the rate at which research occursand to make exploration more competitive
perhaps i misunderstood you are you dropping roles because youre trying to have more time for csm business or are you dropping roles because you think it makes you more neutral
greater than 1 less than 100in what terms economically see heres the problem again you keep generalising whats important to one person might not necessarily be important to someone elseno im perfect if i told you i was a brain surgeon how would you be able to disprove me surebecause i am sick of people like you who hide in anonymity sniping from the shadows when you dont even have enough courage to run for the csm yourself you open a can of worms and question the value of me i will question he value of you im not a punching bag do some research about the csm and the people running for it before you start throwing out insults
so asking some rather straight forward questions of you in regard to what i feel is important for a csm is unacceptable for you while at the same time im supposed to do research on the candidates part of which is question asking but when i do i get a bunch more defensive responses and find myself trying to be made the issueso basically you want to run for csm but you dont want to face any scrutiny and anyone who does scrutinize you as a candidate well there is obviously something wrong with them
no im happy for scrutiny you just seem to not want to do any homework everything you asked of me is available in my blog
then why did you not simply state in your initial reply that i could find how mistaken i might be if i went and looked at your blog
i thought it was more entertaining this way besides i got to plug my dixieland britney project
could we maybe get a cover of oops i did it again posted in a mp3
i prefer toxic  much nicer twang to it
what csm needs is brains and someone that will stand against ccp and say no instead of saying sorry we wount say anythin again im sorry ccp csm start kissing ccps shoes

training an account that you dont pay for is cheating imo im glad ccp removed this way for you to gain an unfair advantage over people who actually pay for all their accountsimo csm should congratulate ccp for taking this action and ask why they didnt do it sooner
nice to see this has been unlocked  thankyou
editwill have to consolidate accounts if this change continues to be implemented 
as i said if this goes tro 2 accountsi always come back  cos i like this game but its bs that it is a bug after 5 years

dumbest idea by ccp since gtc price hike
ghost training will lose ccp money not get them more
i doubt the true effect of this farce will be known for 1 to 3 months once people have stuck 30 or 60 days on expired accounts waited for 29 days then transferred chars to other accounts
im deployed an have no issues paying to skill whether i can play or notim all for the removal of ghosting it was a great move and looooong overdue should have been in effect before carriersmomstitans
i have never used ghost training a phrase which didnt exist until ccp recently invented it on either of my accounts i never had any intention to do soi do however see the merits of it and it seemed like a great part of the service  another thing that set eve apart from all the other gamesin order for someone to gain any benefit from ghost training they had to resubscribe these are repeat customersi think the decision to remove it was bad overall but that is as nothing compared to the way ccp handled it in some ways similar to the handling of the t20 incidentin this case they do something very unpopular which effectively downgrades the service people were used to for five years then they pull any amount of garbage from thin air to explian why they did it bug unintended a balance issuethen they massively censor anyone who tries to complain about itthis is hot on the heels of the gtc pricehike that was dressed up as being more efficient to have only 60 day cards which suddenly cost more than two 30 day cards but thats because eve is a premium product apparentlyin neither case gtc or ghost training did they mention trying to maximise revenues  no hint of that at all
it wasnt so lets penalise those that havent trained up carrier 5 yetbtw anyone wanna buy a char with carrier 5 fighters 5 adv drone inter 5 command ships 5 to name but a few of the stupidly long ones trained
this was quite a interesting post on the blog thread by gutta percha post no 4572quotingits time to put this bug crap to rest once and for allas a programmer of 45 years i can see very clearly that this was never a bug in fact it had been the simplest most elegant implementation of timebased training possiblefor the type of training eve has had several fields were added to the char info in the databasecurrent skill database key of the skillcompletion datetime datetimeany number of individual skill records subordinate to the char store the id of each skill and the sp or percentage of progress the subordinate record for the current skill tracked in the char info doesnt have to be updated until examined at the next login and then either set to completed or 100 and then only if the skill step has been completedif a skill is not actively paused the static completion datetime means that a waiting period is being imposed the skill step can only be used after the waiting period has expired in reality its not training  its a wait and not even a game wait its an outofgame calendar waitnote that an entry in the database of a completion datetime requires no work there is no actual ongoing process of training rather in the mechanics of the game the training completion is a foregone conclusion that will be discovered at some future time when the eve client connects and discovers that the datetime for completion has passedmeanwhile the apparency of ongoing training the countdown and progress bar in the char sheet are illusions created in the eve clientthis mechanism for managing training that works by calendarclock time instead of ingame actions is elegant it requires no work or effort on the part of the servers in fact the server cluster could go up in smoke a new cluster could be built over the course of days weeks or a month and in the end no training will have been lost because the training is not a process but merely a recorded completion datetimenow an elegant mechanism like this is automatically going to train while you are offline and yes while you are unsubscribed nothing is given away for free everything needed has been paid for and done under an active subscription and only the calendar waiting period must run its course before the skill step can be used and then only if you actually log in againthis elegant mechanism was designed this way to minimize the impact of training on the servers its beautiful anything different would be inelegant and probablly horribleso now they have broken that elegant mechanism by the addition of new code code that forcibly puts a skill into the paused state when an account is marked as inactive this is more work for the servers than before it is more work for the database than before it is less elegant less perfect and wholly artificialccp is now penalizing us for something that formerly cost them nothing and in doing so are going to extra effort going out of their way to set training steps to a paused state in effect they seek to charge us for a calendar waiting period for a skill we have already paid for and had to be active and online to initiateend quote
i didnt use this feature but it is one of the things that separated eve from every other ty mmo out there and made it a unique experience
thanks for unlocking this voting threadwhich means ofc directed to the posters please keep this thread free of discussion on the topic because thats basically why it got lockedccp wants the discussion to be kept in the according thread here which should be obeyed they even managed to unhide it so please do them this favor  even if you disagree with the change andor the communication of the change
a big and sound no to the ghosttrain nerffrom my point of view they just robbed me of my hobbyedit for the hard readers i absolutely support the reinstallment of this feature
as a net solutions architect among other things i have to agree with the post two above and indeed if it was written any other way it would be simple to merge the solution above into the current codebaseand if ccp are too thick to do it that way it explains jita
bad pr by ccp  both in removing the trainingand in the way they tried to bull about the motivesand in the way they have dealt with people complaining about it
please give the skill que and a way to access skill training from browsers out of game if i travel it is sometimes difficult to access eve
a que would be really greatif not a que then the 75 primary and 25 seconadary skill training idea where if either finishes the other carry on at full training speed what you never had two books on the go in rl
i can see no reason this has not been implemented long long ago
signed
i totally support this idea after 5 years its about time ccp add a skill queue and have no reason not to now ghost training has gone
a skill que of like say no more than 35 would be excellent allows for those of us going on vacation or away for business to be able to set a few skills to train in our absence

i didnt know about this until just now  and this really effects something i just paid 15bn isk forthus this whole fiasco and preparation ive been doing  this is a significant  problemsignedfix this immediately ccp
capital smartbombs reallyas tusko noted in another thread the main applications for smartbombs are on capital ships however i do not agree that these are applications which should be having a lower barrier to entry fine if you wanna officer fit your super capital fine but i still dont agree with smartbombing on gates killing frigates and pods without the ability to get awaysmartbombs are also wellknown to cause more lag than normal weaponswhile i like variety i dont think smartbombs are all that good to promote ccp should spend their on balancing capitals rather than making them overpowered with giving them more smartbombs
while i agree that smartbombs arent exactly as smart as their name intends and could do with some work to make them more versatile im completely against the introduction of a capital sized smartbomblooking at the footprint of a capital ship its sheer size effectively gives any smartbomb it has fitted a range bonus due to the way its aoe is calculatedfor their purpose capitals already have sufficient firepower in terms of fighters for carriers and turrets with siege mode for dreads if the argument is that they cant defend themselves against smaller ships or swarms of drones and fighers then its a moot and completely void point due to the fact that capitals are not and should never be solo pwn mobiles theyre designed to be deployed with support to defend them and in multiple numbers to assist eachotherlooking at supercapitals ill say the same about them as the standard capitals again theyre not designed to be deployed solo the benefits of owning and deploying them such as a clonebay massive hangars sheer hitpoints remote logistics potential and invulnerability to just about every flavour of ew out there far outweigh the distadvantages and the main offset is that they need to be babysat when deployed into an engagementlooking at it simply theres one type of capital that already has a capital smartbomb with four flavours for your intended race of training thats powerful enough and restricted enough with its anchoring effect on the ship for 10 minutes and its inability to be fired in lowsec to be balancedcapitals and capital gangs have never been about the little guys theyre designed for terratorial disputes theyre designed for big space claiming entities to show their muscle and support their fleets in sieges on static structures such as stations and control towersfrom what i can see in their design although theyre being used and lost in such a manner its never been inherent in the way theyve been thought out for them to be a platform to support a small gang on the field perhaps from a distance assigning fighters yeah but not on the front line where theres little to no direct supporti cant see how adding a capital smartbomb would be something that would benefit the capital classes at all there are already tools there for the defense of capitals nullsec alliances have proved this time and time again by pulling them out of the a agree smartbombs do need work what would i like to seea standard vanilla module in the form of a micro small medium and large smartbomb with their current ranges per size that do a limited amout of all four damage types a lot less than the current hit that a damage specific bomb will doadd the ability to script it in two ways to boost its range and give it a larger aoe while maintaining the same relatively weak blast of all four damage types or to focus the module to produce a single damage type with a magnified amount of base damage traded off for much higher cap useagehow would this be useful and balancedthe increase in range is offset by the fact that the damage is relatively low however there is still the possiblity of stacking the modules to create a larger effect if you want to sacrifice the highslotsthe increase in damage for the focused module means that a pilot can focus his damage types against the targets hes tryin to destroy however he has to have the knowledge and ability to micromanage his targets and know what the hell hes doing or his scripted modules are worth nothingid far rather see this over the introduction of a rack of highslot modules for a capital ship that is effectively a pwn buttonno doubt ill get flamed as usual and accused of being biased and posting only to troll you as usual but the plain fact of the matter is that i simply think there are better alternatives than jumping in feet first with an xl aoe weapon
against the nerf passionately it kills close range combat roaming gangs and renders fragile ships useless alpha fodder
against so if you have no ideea how to pvp just make a blob and win yee for the lag that comes with numbers i agree that snakes schould be nerfed but the this is way too much that a noob in an insured bs stays and only activates modules this is the pvp you wonti certanly do not and will not
cruise missiles even with the speed nerf still cannot hit anything the things it can hit has so much effective hp that stealth bombers are utterly useless and easily defeatedbombs are roughly 1520million per bomb it takes 3 to kill anything so you literally are spending nearly 100mil just to get kills thats just totally nutsnext bombs are very hard to predict you are plausibly going to kill yourself or your friends along with the enemyi dont know how ccp are going to adjust bombs but honestly the cruise missiles need adjusting to make them alpha kill virtually all untanked frigates or drop cruise missiles entirely and give stealth bombers citadel torps who then are used in antibscapital warfare which is big value and not overpowered 30 second rof with only about 10000 alpha dmg only able to effectively hit battleships or larger
bombs need to be improved to increase usage also has anyone noticed that the sbs have 7 bonus two for class frig two more for cov ops and three for role yet still not alot of players fly these ships mainstream very very niche ship that is outclassed by other more capable and cheap shipsi would like to see it given either warp while cloaked or the ability to target while cloaked whilst also having the missiles damage while cloaked i believe this would give the ship the survivability edge without boosting hps would also encourage a wolf pack mentality thus grouping players together in order to kill larger targets
1note about rl naval warfare dreadnoughts like the malaya that fought at jutland were fazed out a long time ago because they could be sunk by smaller cheaper units like the torpedo destroyer and submarine eve currently has an arms race where dreads ar
sorry no the question is nonsensical theres no tradeoff the interests to which you refer are not supported at the expense of anyone else sp and rp are not zerosum mechanisms look up the term most of the things nonthinking people think are zerosum are actually notyou fail again dont try to design things you dont know how to design a simple rule would prevent the problem you mistakenly believe would occur keep absentee training as it is but the queue doesnt kick in while youre suspended that would give us a queue but keep unsub training just as it has been for 5 years see how easy that wasyou also seem to be confused about what constitutes playingi wont go into rp as it isnt my thing but training sps are bought and paid for the moment you click to initiate the training step there is no ongoing training activity  its an illusion there is only a completion datetime which only means you cant use the benefit of the skill step before that time and whether you play or not in the meantime is completely irrelevant therefore whether you pay in the meantime should also be irrelevant
two words come to mined sod off 
nope we all have the ability to do it ok 1 of the 2 stated at least
i hereby propose that the logoff timer when aggrod be increased to 23 minutes i dare say 35 minutes would be more appropriate but increasing it 23 minutes would be a significant blow to the log off tacticdiscuss
supporting anything to get rid of logoffski bs
all true and good however there is no way to gauge if someone has logged off or has a genuine ctd until such time that the server can differentiate between logofski and ctd how can anyone support this
how can you not support a fix to an exploit used by so many every day
signed all for the exploit to get fixed whether its regarded as one
if you ctdsorry not my problem fix your computereve is a pretty stable game and internet lately is also quite stable if a few people end up losing their ships due to a legit dc a very few to stop this exploit then its still worth it
thats the thing i agree that if the bugger logs off he deserves the best spanking he can get but you cant say fix your computer  especially if the client is defective i play on a mac now and mac client has stability issues and it is certainly not my mac so it happens that the whole client collapses into a heap and i have to restart the computer to start the client again which is plain weird thats the problem i have i want to punish those who do it on purpose and at the same time i want to be protected when the genuine issue happens to me or to others what do i sign then and how do i vote

i like the idea of planetary assets being about production and consumption npc trade goods optimal production chains should be spread across regions on planets in multiple systems got to give company haulers independant traders and pirates the opportunity and demand for trade goods should have components that vary randomly across time and space  from 48hour fads to 3month fluctuationsthe new system would need to be iskneutral in the long run the theoretical ideal profit from the whole system produce  and  sell  back  to  npcs cycle minus the asset taxes should be zero or slightly positive whatever ccp thinks is a good isk source levelmaybe a wellorganised group of players would be able to set it up as an isk source but theyd be pulling the isk from other players who arent doing so well players might actually want to subsidise unprofitable ventures just for the fun of it which would create an isk sinkso if its not guaranteed to net you any isk why would you do it boasting rights and roleplay you would be the governor of a planetary region amarrians could aspire to be holders minmatar familyclan leaders caldari megacorp installationregional managers gallente regional senate representatives or local leaders and out in 00 players can call themselves whatever they like in lowsec it could be related to fw by only allowing new types of regional governor eg amarrian holder to aquire assets when the appropriate faction is in control of the system in nullsec it could be related to sovereignty levels or whatever they get replaced with
there are some really good concepts in this thread but there are also a few problems1 would the trade good be based entirely on npc demand if so people could somewhat justly claim favoritism by ccp for modifying the market in a way that is not in their favorthe answer to this is to make all trade goods from reports to exotic dancers usable in the game in one fashion or another people could use scientists if they could train them up using special reeducation facilities and frozen food as will soon be posted on my website i sense there are some major manufacturing changes coming from ccp in the next patch so well have to see2 can the planet become a dedicated producer of t1 items or even named t1 items this would open the market up greatly as somebody with enough research isk and time could start manufacturing x5 webbers throwing a massive fork into the gears of the ccp economyi think the stations should be able to be taken over but in a completely different field maybe by bribing the officials of the city with luxury goods spiced wine and longlimb roes for instance this would create a whole new form of piracy and a new career in the game as it were
ive advocated for years changes in the markets for fundamental npc goodsmy original quest was to rationalize the items purchased by npc stations so that the items purchased are reasonable inputs to the items they produce example producing robotics should require electronic parts as an input related effect if no one brings ep to the station to sell the station should cease producing robotics and it should raise the price it is offering for epwhile the buy a planet based enterprise proposal addresses potential increases in output via the expansion and efficiency improvement routes it does not discuss potential increases in demand those demand increases should be necessary to avoid increased output driving down pricesas i see it we capsuleers are a very small minority of the overall human population in eve each populated planet in eve likely has between 50 million and 20 billion human inhabitants plus those who live in nearby spacethus the total volume of trade by and between the planets should be enormous the few convoys we see are only the tip of the iceberg  all npc corps must have fleets of freighters dedicated to hauling goods between planetsthis suggests that prices should be quite stable  the volume that capsuleers can haul even in a freighter is small compared to a systems likely total demandpopulations tend to grow or shrivel based on factors which are not modeled in eve at all economies grow in per capita output and demand as well these are also inputs into volume and pricing models and thus markets technical analysis of markets may become possible but fundamental analysis will not be
absolutely
agreed actually im a little surprised that the skill level doesnt unlock the ability to build tech ships by tier for example look at battleship construction you dont need the skill at all to build a dominix megathron or hyperion but you do need it at level 4 to build a kronos whats up with that doesnt it seem more plausible that youd need level 1 to build a tier 1 battleship dominix level 2 to build a tier 2 battleship megathron level 3 to build a tier 3 battleship hyperion level 4 for the tech 2 battleship kronos  yeah yeah its a marauderso in line with other posters id say a small time efficiency bonus 2 sounds reasonable per level plus ability to build the corresponding tier shipsbut i may be reprising something that someone else has already beaten to death  i confess i havent scanned the topicsmdd
yup
very farmerfriendly not necessarily fair cant say i want
then remove it if i can train other characters i wouldnt have to buy them and i disagree about the capital pilots along with some other noncapital pilots i imagineno other mmo has a single shard universe either are you suggesting they should change that in other words i always thought of most people do this as lame argumentand what is character farming and isk farming and how is this done and how is this affected by the requested change saying character farming 10 times without the how and why isnt going to convince mewhy would i want to stop youwhat we are not talking about ghost training herei could live with thisi not sure why but im getting this the bottom line is money nobody gives a vibei mean it is possible to train 2 or more characters and have all the benifits of iskcharacter farming and being able to do everything you only have to pay for it so only poor people who only have one account are not able to have these benifits which kind of goes against one of ccps concepts of equality regardless of real world wealth like it isnt enough that people who pay morehave more accounts have more votes for the csm democracy
youre right using a most people do this argument is lame notice how the op is using it i was merely pointing out that the op is wrong in his statementcharacter farming is paying to train a character up and then selling them on for isk one of the accepted methods for trading rl moneyin terms of the time taken to train for isk having multiple training on accounts would allow everybody to theoretically farm 2 of these characters for free and of course as pointed out absolutely everybody and their dog would be able to train an industrial alt mining alt cloaking alt invention alt etc whatever happened to the multiplayer element of mmosedit cos i fail at quoting
well i can see both sides of the argument hereand i think i have a more palatable solutionhave one character flagged as main that character trains as normalalt1 and no alt 2 would train at half speedalt1 and alt 2 would train at 25 speedthis keeps characters down in skill points rather then boosting as the other person suggested which should make ccp happier it will still keep the alts under control and should stop character farmers from going to nuts
they can do what ever they want with this game they own it butif you create the csm for beter communication with the player base and then dont use that tool for this kind of things it becomes a liewhe can argue about ghost training but its there call but the communication style lieng and cheating that is what should be stoped by the csm
wait what what kind of logic is thisthe csm hasnt had a chance to get together for a meeting yet in order to discuss ghost trainingyet you deduce because ccp hasnt changed their mind that the csm is uselesswow awesome logic seriously
i was thinking about the way i used to ghost train i have a main this one who i have subscribing almost continually for the entire of the chars life just oevr 4 yrs and i have an alt who i sub when i can afford itnow what i always did was sub for a month train in a specific fiel duntil lv5 get in a few small sills and then set a lv5 going and cancel the subyes am sure alot of peopel did this but with having that lv5 skill trainign it always gave me sumthing to come back to at the end of max 38days so far now tho i cant afford to continually sub the char and with the skill not training i have nothing to make me sub again after a month or soso what happens is i had a contnual main and then i semi subbed a char for 6 months of the year now tho i may only sub it in a coupel months time when i find a reason to or maybe even just selldelete the char all together so ccp have gone from having 100 sub and a 50 sub to just a 100 sub and maybe a 1025 sub losing UFFFD135 from me losing 9 months subs if that happens with 500 people then the costs soon start to mount up UFFFD67500maybe allow us to have a certain cut rate price for an alt account linking yeah liek power of 2 but maybe summat continually so ccp still get more cash and those that used to be as fair as possibly can with ghost trainign can afford to run an alt too
training an account that you dont pay for is cheating imo im glad ccp removed this way for you to gain an unfair advantage over people who actually pay for all their accountsimo csm should congratulate ccp for taking this action and ask why they didnt do it sooner
actually i think that what will happen when csm delivers its questions to ccp would really decide for me and should for you what csm is all about until csm actually does something we cant say whether they were effective or were ignored the only gripe i have with csm is that with the exception of couple of members csm has been very quiet on their interactions with ccp whether as some say due to nda or other issues the appearance is there that the wereare ineffectual this is what should change with next csm i hope as far as the issue reflected in this thread csm should make a joint statement  all members together  as to what has been discussed with ccp unless of course ccp invokes the nda thing again or vetoes the discussion outright till then they should have a benefit of the doubt
i have two accounts one for mining and one for combat skilling i have been able to maintain both by buying time codes with mining isk and it had been working fine now time code prices have climbed past the 12 billion mark and continue to rise and my plan was to ghost train one account for 20 days to catch up but obviously now thats not an option what is left as an option is to combine my mains into one account and try to maintain eve is becoming more like a job than a diversion not fun
the game has evolved over the last 5 years and with it many concepts have changed and the play of the game as also changedi think it is past time for ccp to put a team togeather and go through the ships and better define the roles of the various ship classes and the ships themselvesmany ships had certain roles in mind that they just dont do well at anymore or the role itself is broken or uselessit is time for a good hard look at each ship class and role and make sure every ship fits somewhere and has a purposethere are many ships that are just not flown or are flown so rarely as to be non existiant in the gamethis should be looked at ship by ship and fixed so that every ship has a role and abilities that assist that role the roles should be based on what current players use them for and what ccp wants them used for not just one side or the other

that does not make any sense at allcan i mail you some lead and you turn it into gold for me very small change actually not often done though as far as i was toldwhat you are asking for would require full scale matter transformation and if that existed in eve there would be no need whatsoever to take anything specific you could make tritatium out of air dust rock water or orange juice
it would be nice if poss could be fueled by orange juice much better tasting then plane old heavy water
actually in all 00 regions you can get some of every mineral from rat loot you just cant mine it all drones drop everything of coursemelting down 1600mm plates may not get you enough megacyte for a bs quickly but dont underestimate its effects especially on low ends rat loot is a larger source of minerals than mining
what have the csm accomplished so fargiving us an actual rundown of what the first csm have done for us would make us more or less inclined to vote for a 2nd council
are you meaning things which has maked it into the game is that what you want a rundown of
actual changes or planned changes or features yes ccp being aware of your concerns means very little to the average voter
well when you try to use that kind of logic you immediately hit a brick wallthings dont happen over night ccp has said this times and times again it might take another year before the features we have requested actually sees the lighthowever several things already made it onto sisi minifreighterits model is there but the full ship will be here by the winter store fronts ui fixestons of themand theres probably more to come as we see the full extent of this expansion
until you take credit and credit is confirmed from ccp people not in the know on council or in close contact with those who are will think nothing substantial has come from it and election figures will be even less than last time around
i frankly agree we did discuss with ccp about adding a small icon in patchnotes for all items which were raised by the csm it seems like a great idea to mehowever they later refused that because they thought it would become a ing contest
simply dont put any names on it just add the csm stamp
i must assume that would certainly be the case however you could get into a ing contest by comparing who had most csm items in the patch notes during their termi still think its a silly argument
i dont see a problem there something to work towards then improving the game as much as possible im sure people can settle claims of solutions that are not exclusive for one csm and youd both get on that golden killmail
im more than willing to give the csm time to make changes for the better considering the stubborn non approachability of the gms etc change for the better takes time and considering the pit the powers that be in the game have dug hemselves the work involved to rectify must be enormouscsm keep up the good work i really appreciate what you are trying to achieve
attention to suicide ganking  even if they already had changes planned us putting it on the agenda certainly pulled it forward several monthsmaking faction warfare missions easier based on the feedback in our documentsalliance participation in factional warfare should be there soon theyre definately working on it now
dont settle for commenting on this thread it needs to be out there in the election repeated over and over as to notify the voters that things do happen
actually meeting notes for all meetings should be posted players can see what issues were voted to ccp from these although i am pushing for a clearer record of issues escalateddiscussed in future there are still a number of meeting minutes missing which is not desirablethe trouble with highlighting csm issues that make it in gamethe csm doesnt really act as a cohesive unit when it election time comes near youll see csm members reeling off their raised issues that made it into game trouble with this is that many issues were brought to csm attention via forums or were issues that have been about for a long time and may have been already in the process of being fixed also it required more than one csm member to vote it through additionally candidates that havent been on the csm or alternates have a distinct disadvantage for the elections if this occurs especially for new voters looking through campaign materialsnow you might think this isnt major id agree with a csm stamp etc if the csm membersalts agreed not to use it in electioneering afterall the csm is there to serve players not further individual intereststake carearithron
i dont care who tries to use the results to further their own campaign what im concerned with is that results are presented as to give the voters an incentive to vote at all
thats what meeting minute notes and effective communication is fortake carearithron
im still working on that wiki which contains all our issues our votes the status of the issues and what ccp has been doing with it and im sure ill have it ready before next voting round starts
at best they have helped push eve further in the direction of a mostly pve empire based game
ccp also share responsibility for posting minutes and one csm member shouldnt be responsible for such a wiki alone as its a large job that could be shared outtake carearithron
youve got proof to support this outrageous claim
i name most of my ships my mission running dominix is named  stargate fcku my cnr is named uss mudkipzthis is because i really dont have strategic need to name them anything specificif i were in low sec i would use default name for my 2400 omni dps tank myrmidon i would cruise around in belts ratting waiting for pirates to attack me my gang would then jump into the belt and have fun with them the myrmidon ratting in belt 1 jump from high sec looks aweful newby and on top of that my ships name is default crappy named juicy and easy kill is plastered all over the screenso i think the default name is best
i like this idea

the topic pretty much says it alreadythere are so many cool ships in the game that we cannot fly because they are not available it would be great if more of them were available as faction ships since the models are already there it would be little effort to make them available to playerswith the significant presence of tech ii ships it would also be great if there were tech ii versions of the faction ships
i just want faction battlecruisers and destroyersthere was sum talk that more faction ships was going to be introduced but all weve seen so far are the new navy versions of the osprey omen exqueror and scythediscussion has been going on for bout 2 yrs now of more faction ships tho
i believe we did in fact discuss this with ccp just a little over a week ago please keep an eye out for the minutes from this
ah hell faction myrmidon and faction drake ftwsigned
i think faction industrial ships are in order like imperial freighters or something anyway more faction ships  good whatever they are

for now your best source of information is this devblogfor the candidates running the jita sparker corner is at this point your only source of information however i imagine that a list of candidates will be posted soon by ccp
dev on jita park has called for candidates to link their thread into a sticky official list will be published soon but there are already info threads where you can see external site links platforms and ask questions of candidatestake carearithron
not so fast pls suppose the quantity of mineable minerals is in the high hundreds to low thousands of hours there are about 740 hours in a monthas soon as you put up a moon miner and begin production youd know how long you have on that moon but no one else would knowis this still a valuable target yes if youre practicing economic warfare and it probably is if youve been watching know the moon miner went up recently and therefore the deposit remaining is likely largebesides who said the goal here is to make things easy for would be attackers as it is things are already easy for them  each pos is a target they have unlimited economic life and they cant move all you have to do is bring up enough dreads to defeat any weapons and then outwait the limited amount of sc the tower can hold if you can defeat the oppos fleet  you have an assured conquestas to putting pos on all moons  unless youre trying to assure system sovereignty this is too expensive even a small pos with defenses costs seeral hundred million isk operating just one small one costs on the order of 7 to 10 million per weeknow maybe your outfit can afford to spend some billions to cover all the moons in a single system and can keep them running at a cost of 350 million or more isk per week im thinking that most moon mining ops cant begin to make that sort of income and so people wont do that

i always viewed this csm thingy as a pure pr stunt if ccp was genuinely interested in knowing their customers opinions it would simply require adding the pertinent frontend to a databasedriven polling system and bang they could have their crossreferenced stats on as many subjects and how often it would be deemed opportuneif ccp was also genuinely interested in eve players grey matter an equivalent system could be put at disposal of the community to allow polls on players issued proposals in the spirit to perfect or add new features to the gameinstead they came up with the principle of a consultative representative body well representative bodies are just that an imperfect snapshot limited to the opinion of those positively interested since you dont get the option to vote against the csm with no implicit guarantees that the peeps you vote for will act as you wish the consultative part is even more cute basically this means we might listen to the csm in areas we dont really care or view as criticalthats why i consider all this crap a monument of futility  deception but maybe im wrong hence im interested not in who will get elected but in the participation rate imho i expect the number of voters vs the number of active accounts to be lower than the first timeonly time will tell
i think you are right i really hope that we see an increase in actual  voters of the userbase however at this point it seems like we have dont have very many candidates at allmaybe people realized its not an easy task to be a csm member however if there becomes less and less people who wants to run for csm we might have a problemim sure we will always have enough interest in the csm to make it relevant i and several other members of the council have taken initiative to get onto things like eve radio podcasts and even places like evemagcom in order to increase awareness i hope it pays off and we will see at least 15 turnout
i personally dont agree with changing the skill system given the information that we have its been that way for a long time and i think that the people it will impact the most will not be some evil cheaters out to game the system but returning players and casual players taking a break who legitimately want to return to the game and now will be less likely to do socould there have been greater reason than what was given in the blog certainly however the communication made by ccp was lacking in details and the amount of notice was inadequate it was a change that was slammed down hard and fast with no opportunity for people to prepare to digest the bad taste in their mouths before receiving the consequences and thats a terrible place to leave a customer id posit that its the exact opposite of what youd want a customer interaction to befirstly i dont think that rp aside anyone griefs because they want to make someone move to 00 that would be silly getting your things destroyed or having your fun ruined isnt going to make you want to leave your crib it is my firm belief that people will move to 00 when it becomes worth it to them right now the reward vs risk is completely off there is simply not enough money to be made at least by the casual observer in 00 to make it worth their while for the people residing in empire to move it is my belief that 00 needs to be incentivized in order for that to happen people will band together and take more risks when the payoff makes it worth it today the only payoff is a spot on the map for the most part and marginally better ratting space and asteroids woo hoo
firstly there wasnt a lot of csm time spent on the issue it passed with a relatively low degree of feedback secondly its a forgone conclusion that walking in stations is going to occur if we were asked whether or not it should occur i may very well have said no considering the status of various other aspects of the game but the fact is that it is going to occur given that we will have walking in stations fairly soon what is the harm of proposing something interesting to do while walking in stations the developer time is already being spent on it and if it wasnt playing music they were coding in it would just be something else neither goonfleet nor goonswarm have ever officially stated we wish to destroy eve least of all from the inside there may have been statements made to that effect by individuals in the heat of anger but that certainly hasnt been a motivation of the entire organization as i said in my last election thread our intention is to play a fun game and hopefully improve it for everyone our motivation is to play a good game as far as working towards making a joke out of the csm or ccp well i think that my fellow members of the council and ccp reps would have to agree that while we may have some disagreements about certain things and some differences in how we choose to express them ive been a valuable and contributing part of the process ive done nothing to earn a mantle of disruption i want a fun and engaging game to play thats it and thats allive supported a number of issues which made it through the last csm as a matter of fact i supported a large majority of what was passed my major concerns are of course always going to be the aspects of the game im most heavily involved in pvp and 00 warfare however that hasnt prevented me from supporting and providing input on other issues a singular accomplishment that i could point to would be the 00 rountables which will happen at fanfest after seeing the way the discussions were going and how 00based solutions were getting to the council it occurred to me that the only way we were going to get any headway was by forming some degree of a consensus i thought that the best way to at least begin this process would be a pair of roundtables during fanfest so i sent a letter to ccp stating exactly that and im happy that theyve decided to add these roundtables to the docket i had proposed that we have one for people currently living in 00 to express their gripes concerns and desires and one roundtable for people who arent in 00 to express why theyre not and help gauge what types of changes would make it more attractiveill continue in an additional post as work is calling and im almost out of room
to answer this ill simply point to my previous answer regarding your similar question the idea that we want to destroy eve is a rather oft repeated propaganda ploy nothing more while they certainly cannot weigh in or express their support in this regard i think anyone whom ive dealt with at ccp would attest to my devotion to the cause of bettering ccp and eve onlinewhile i have made the mistake at times of using a hammer to solve a problem which could have been better handled with something lighter ive never shown any indication in any way regarding my status of a csm of anything other than the best intentions were not always going to agree on the solution to various problems but a part of the exercise is to be able to voice those opinions have them heard and to have a dialogue about them
my visionon november 14th of last year i was logged in to change skills and update my research lines when a corpmate mentioned a new dev blog about something called the council of stellar management i had no idea what he was talking about so i went onto the website and looked up the dev blog inside i found a 20 page chunk of political philosophy shoehorned into the mold of a computer game in it also lay the soul of eve i do not believe that ccp set out to make a game when they designed eve and i do not believe that they think in terms of making a game today of course they do so superficially but at its heart ccp has built a world for us to play in rather than merely a game for us to play with market share player enjoyment and all the rest matter but theyre secondary to building a world that feels real and that makes sense as a world concessions to gameplay exist  infinite supplies of enemies respawning asteroids in belts 50 km wide and so on  but they always feel like its a guilty failure of vision not like its a gleeful attempt to fit within the mould laid down by others so it was here ccp did not talk about player input into the game as a feature they talked about it as a natural right of individuals living in a civilization their goal was to create a deliberative democracy to allow the will of the people to express itself to the government of course it contained the usual ccp excesses  a grand document they spent huge amounts of time on with promises they still havent delivered on a year later wikipedia footnotes and halfcompleted proofreading  but in this case it truly is the thought that counts the thought in this case was the thought that makes democracy a functional system of government in worlds both real and virtual individuals tend to be intelligent and thoughtful often making better decisions in large groups than even the best individual can and they tend to work for their own good and the good of those around them the csm is an attempt to harness the power of democracy to improve eve and as such it is one of the more ambitious experiments ccp has ever attempted but given the experimentally observed effects of democracy in the real world it also has the potential to be one of their greatest successes it is our responsibility as players to ensure that this potential is not squandered because of us not merely because some would consider it a moral obligation but because we will be the ones who benefit from a game that harnesses the power of democracy to better itself if we care about the future of the game we ought to get involved in shaping that future as best we can we should become informed we should be active in the political life of our society and we should try to use our powers of reason persuasion and voting to attempt to enact the changes we see as being the most beneficial we should stand up for what we believe in because we believe in it this is what i have attempted to do as a member of the eve universe ever since the council of stellar management became a reality this april i gathered information read the platform of every candidate who had one and cast my vote for the candidate who i believed had the best vision to take the game forward i have been involved in the csms processes from the beginning being probably the most active player in the csmspecific forums and having done what i can at every point to aid the csms internal processes participating in everything from the keeping list of topics raised updated to creating archive threads for past csm information to participating in virtually every discussion of how the csm can improve its ways of doing business
the only way i have not attempted to participate thus far is by being a candidate standing for election and now is the time to change that i have a strong agenda for the future that i genuinely believe will make the game a better one for everybody and i believe that my vision is shared by enough other players that i can make a real difference in eve going forward as such it is time for me to take that final leap and stand for election as a councilor my slogan is a simple one  experience dedication clarity  but it encapsulates the core of my campaign and my beliefs i have more experience with the csm than most other candidates in this race having been as involved as a nonmember can be since day one and having a significant amount of experience with similar bodies in the real world i am fiercely dedicated to fulfilling my responsibilities to others and i will never shirk them or abandon them because its too hard or too boring and i believe strongly in a series of measures designed to improve clarity in the csm rules of order and improved resources for players to understand what we are doing and in eve a wide array of improvements to the user interface and to documentation of how the game works my beliefs are more complex than that as any persons are but that is the core of why i am running and what i will do if the players entrust me with a seat on the council i do not run because i think i can bend the game to my will or because i think i will be able to dictate terms to ccp the csm is an advisory body not a legislature and it must act as one there are things that cannot be done due to limited resources things that will not be done due to the developers having responsibilities to ccp shareholders that take precedence over their responsibilities to eve players and things that will be done very differently than we propose because of the rounds of testing that ideas must go through before they are made into final changes to the game however we as players have one great advantage offsetting the limitations i just described  ccp genuinely does care they may do boneheaded things from time to time  the fact that eve was not intended as a game shows up in negative ways as well as positive  and i will attack them when that happens but at the end of the day ccp loves this game as much as any player because it is both their passion and their child they want to see what is best for eve and they have entrusted us as players with a major role in that process it is our responsibility to ensure that we work with the developers that we advise them to the best of our collective ability and that we do what is best for eve and with your help that is precisely what i intend to spend the next six months doing thank you
policy  csm internalthe first csm has been a success in many ways but it has also been plagued with a large number of problems with how things are done and if i am elected i will make a priority of identifying and fixing as many of these problems as possible here are the primary issues with the csms internal mechanics that i see at presentone of the saddest things about watching how the previous csm has done business over the last four months has been seeing how badly the council itself was run there have been long protracted fights over the nature of the chairmans powers whether or not members have the right to abstain from a vote and several other similar minor procedural matters of no importance to anybodythe reason for this is simple  the last council never specified rules of order of any sort and as such any time a debate over how to conduct business came up they had no way to decide except internal wrangling the results of this are as obvious as they are inevitable  gridlock on procedural matters with the only way to break it being to shout the loudest this was bad for one term of office but it would be worse if it were to continue for a secondas such i pledge to bring up a vote to establish rules of order for future use at the first meeting of the new csm my preference is for roberts rules of order since they are both widely used and freely available and i have a great deal of past experience with them but i will accept any rules that the rest of the council feels comfortable with so long as they are comprehensive and usablealmost as fundamental as rules of order is the issue of how meetings are conducted at present the requirement to make meetings happen in a chat channel is causing an immense amount of scheduling problems and that is with the csm being made up of seven europeans and two americans with a total time zone spread of only seven hours the difficulties omber zombie has had making meetings are unfortunate but he was only an alternate this time  how ugly would scheduling be if he or another person in australia or east asia were a full member whose schedule had to be accommodated this is a game played worldwide and the problem of scheduling meetings is not a trivial one under those circumstancesbetween this and the issues of meetings getting longer and members having to leave midway through them a new process for conducting csm meeting should be looked into specifically i will look into the possibility of moving csm votes away from chat channels and towards a forumbased system these forums will be publicly accessible although the actual voting threads will be limited to csm members and alternates to allow for uninterrupted debate to take place i am aware that the current structure of the official eve forums cannot accommodate this at present unfortunately and thus one of two alternative methods for doing this will have to be looked at my understanding is that ccp is working on the longoverdue overhaul to the forums and if this is the case then i would like to work with ccp to ensure that the new forum software has the ability to do what we would like it to for this purpose failing that however the option of using offsite forums for this task will be implemented
another point of contention in the past has been the method of selecting the chair the rules specify that the person receiving the most votes in the election is chair but the election measures who would make the best representative not who would make the best person to run meetings as such i will encourage whoever finishes first in the election to step aside as chair as soon as possible and hold a vote inside the csm on who will be the new chair if i am elected chair i will resign immediately following the vote on rules of order and hold an election to fill the roleit should be easier in future for players unfamiliar with the csm and its processes to get at what they want to know without having to sort through the chaos of the forums as such i will work to establish new threads of reference materials for stickying on the assembly hall and jita park speakers corner i have already made one thread in this vein  an archive of past csm submissions  and i will work with the rest of the csm to figure out what a handful of other useful threads would be for reference to allow players to quickly find what they want to know without flooding the boards with stickies of dubious utility my inclinations are to a thread on jpsc linking meeting agendas a thread on jpsc linking the items approved for submission in the next submission to ccp and a thread on ah linking all topics to be discussed at the upcoming meeting as well as the one i have already posted this is subject to discussions with the rest of the csm and ccps approval howeverthere have been problems over the past term with issues being raised multiple times after they were rejected the first time while this is not necessarily a bad thing it is important to ensure that it is not used to flood meetings with proposals the council will not pass merely because one member feels strongly about it as such i will propose a rule that no topic may be brought back to the council after being rejected unless it is raised by a member who voted against it previously if no new member is supporting it then it cannot pass and as such the council should not waste its time with itfinally it should be ensured that players have access to all the discussions of the csm and that they are all easy to find this should ultimately be done by ccp on the official site but it hasnt been thus far and i will work to find the problem that has stopped the chatlogs and minutes from being posted on the official site and fix it the role of providing resources to players can also be fulfilled by thirdparty means and this was well done for the first month by serenity steele with his wwwevecsmcom site but that sites abandonment has left the csm with no thirdparty site to host meeting minutes on leaving us with the stopgap measure of jade constantine using his corporate forums as a de facto csm site while this is certainly better than nothing and his willingness to do this is appreciated it is not how things should be operating and it should be fixed as soon as possible i will ensure that an effective stable thirdparty site for the csm exists for player reference i believe that with the above changes the csm will function much more effectively and spend less time fighting over procedure and more time representing the players to ccp which is the function that this body ultimately exists for
policy  user interfacei will begin by giving credit where credit is due  ccp has been consistently improving the user interface for years changes ranging from contracts to the align to button to the drone changes that have been happening for years now to dozens of others have made the users experience better and made the game consistently more playable and apparently more is coming in the midas expansion with a lot of changes to science and industry however as much as the game has been changing for the better it hasnt been changing nearly fast enough internet game reviewer ben yahtzee croshaw said it best and whether you trust his reviews or not his response fits well with what ive heard from many other people ive tried to bring into the game i have yet to come across anyone who wasnt an eve veteran who thought the ui was anything better than marginally usable and after two years i still only find it adequate ccp may have a team of ui programmers but there are limits on what three or four people can do for a game as sprawling as eve with as bad of a ui as it has especially given that this isnt changes to an alpha test version but instead to a longdeployed game they need to come up with improvements and they need to work within a pile of code that they cant just rip up and change and they have to do this without annoying any significant number of people its not surprising that theyre moving slowly but it is immensely frustrating this is not a phrase i will utter very often but this is a field where eve could stand to learn quite a lot from world of warcraft i have never played wow myself but i know a lot of people who do and all of them rave about the utility of usercreated user interface modifications you want to move buttons around you can download a quick little file that will do so and all of a sudden the ui is exactly the way you want it without the developers ever having to lift a finger as with most other forms of distributed problemsolving it works incredibly well players with programming skill go into the ui fix whatever problem annoys them and then post the patch on a central website for others to use you need one person to make a change and the whole community benefits from it of course eve does not have the same size of player base as wow but a quarter of a million people will contain one who gets annoyed by just about any problem you care to name  as evidenced by all the game utility sites that exist today  and then the devs can gain freedom of movement since any bad change can be reverted by the players and the players get to play with exactly the ui they want of course there are concerns with this process but they are concerns that other games have faced the game cannot be so moddable that people can use game tools to build macros to play the game for them some interactions are too powerful and will need to be removed the devs will have to keep on top of what is available and what is being used to ensure that the tools that they provide are not being used for undesirable purposes however i believe this to be an important change perhaps even the single most useful change that could be made to the game right now as such i will work to establish a modifiable user interface for eve and i will treat this as the single most important goal of my term of office
however even if my goal of a usermoddable ui is implemented tomorrow the game still needs to cater to new players and as such the default user interface will still need work there have been several players who have created lists of ui problems for the developers to fix most notably xaen with his thread xaens list of ui improvements now over two years old i encourage attempts to create a systematic process for collating and advancing complaints about the ui and i will seek to involve the csm in this process in future prior to every submission to ccp i will create an open thread for desired ui changes those changes that the council decides will likely be beneficial will be advanced to ccp i know that the user interface is not as impressive an issue to deal with as changes to capital warfare or as likely to make headlines it is however just as important to the longterm health of the game and to the good tempers of those playing it while it will not be the only focus of my term of office i think this is an area that has not been addressed adequately to date and it is one where there is still a lot of real progress that needs to be made
policy  gameplaywhen it comes to fundamental gameplay eve is an excellent game and as far as im concerned its easily the best mmo on the market today however as with all things human it is still imperfect and i see a few things about it that could be improved upon the first category of flaw is aspects of the game that ought to be wellused but due to failures of implementation are not the two most obvious of these are low security0104 space and the charisma attribute lowsec suffers from being at exactly the wrong place on the riskreward curve it is about as risky as 00 but with none of the profitability as such its primary uses are for people with specialized desires such as factional warfare or smallscale piracy there is nothing wrong with those uses but theyre not enough a wide variety of things must be done to make lowsec more profitable on the whole and if elected i will propose a wide variety of ways of making lowsec more profitable including but not limited to more lowsec agents better lowsec ores better lowsec complexes and boosts to level 5 missions the other problem lowsec suffers from is that the security mechanism is an impediment to people attempting to take and hold space since any group that shoots intruders will rapidly see their sec status decay too far to enter highsec in order to rectify this i will look into a mechanism that allows for a corporation controlling a lowsec system to defend their system without security loss this would use a control system similar in philosophy to sovereignty in 00 and system control in factional warfare though different in specifics i believe that this would encourage players to colonize lowsec by removing one of the major penalties from it as well as providing a transition to the ultimate endgame of playercontrolled 00 space
it is a maxim in roleplaying that charisma is the dump stat if you want to play an effective powerful character you should do as much as you can to avoid charisma and instead put those attributes into things that help you more which every other attribute generally does unfortunately eve falls into this trap just as badly as dd ever did i play an achura character not because i think that the backstory is cool or the faces look good but because everyone around me when i started told me id have to be insane to play anything else and they were right thats great for me but its bad for the game the problem is that there simply arent many charismausing skills in the game a trader can very naturally max charisma when he creates his character and it will serve him very well until he has about 5 million sp at which point he is out of things to train with charisma and those points drag him down for the rest of the game this is baitandswitch gameplay at its worst and it needs to be rectified as such i will look for new charismausing skills to add to the game and will propose new ones whenever possible i have some proposals for particular charisma skills which could be added such as pos gunnery damage skills ceo skills affecting wardecshave more make them cheaper etc skills that would increase your choice in which mission to take and many others but i will refrain from making definite proposals until a great deal of brainstorming and consultation has been done to ensure that the skills proposed are right for the game and that were not missing any good paths for expansion as well there are a few other issues of this sort that the past csm has already dealt with most notably improvements to the bounty hunter system while these issues are probably settled as far as the csm is concerned i will ensure that these issues are dealt with properly if the previous submissions come across some unforeseen roadblock we do not want the first councils good work going to wastethe second category of flaw is simple balance issues as with any other game this complex theres a lot of these people have complained about everything from the nighthawk to the naglfar from citadel torpedoes to defender missiles most of these concerns are valid and are worthy of attention however they are not the csms primary role ccp has better data on ship usage and effectiveness than any player and they are on the lookout for balance issues as such while i have no objection to bringing forward the players opinions on balance issues i consider most of them to be of secondary importance to more fundamental changes to the structure of the game ccp wants the csm to be more about vision than trivia and i agree with them as such i will attempt to focus on farreaching solutions to balance issues such as my thread proposing a revamp of defender missiles rather than simple add 37 cpu to it fixes that ccp can come up with themselves the goal for the csm is to bring forward new ideas for how to balance ships properly not just to fiddle with numbers
the third category of gameplay issue that the csm can address is the creation of new content or large amendments to old content and this is the one where we as a group can probably do the most for the game issues like balancing of doomsday devices revamping of sovereignty allowing alliances into factional warfare fundamentally changing the nature of how rats drop loot revamping the production cycle to include components and dozens of others in this vein have been the primary job of the csm for the first term of office and this will not change in future there are far too many of these issues for me to express an opinion on each of them here but if you want to know about any of them just ask me however i will outline my approach to these issues generally firstly my primary goal is to do what is best for the game as a whole im not running to benefit one group at the expense of others and even if i was ccp wouldnt implement any such proposals there are always winners and losers in a change but i will do my best to ensure that every change i propose would create more winners secondly i will ensure that every proposal i make is careful and wellconsidered i like to muse about many things on the forums but when it comes time to do this as a responsibility and not a hobby i will take it seriously and ensure that my advice to ccp is as good as i can make it ccp operates under limits on time money programmers public relations and player sentiment and they are hemmed in by the consequences of their past actions if the csm does not respect these limitations and seek to work within them ourselves we might as well be talking to a wall because our suggestions will be useless to ccp i will attempt to make proposals that respect the real limitations on ccp and that work within those limitations to make a better game for everybody and thirdly i will consult with players on proposed changes i read a large swath of the forums and i like to think that i generally know whats going on with the game but i dont know doomsdays as well as a titan pilot and i dont know manufacturing as well as a longtime t2 builder if im proposing major changes to the way that these people play the game i intend to talk with them first that includes any other csm reps with special knowledge of one aspect of the game and it includes players at large i will maintain an opendoor policy when communicating with you the player and will take into consideration what the players tell me on issues nobody gets a veto but if you have something to say ill listen there is also one other way for the csm to aid ccp on gameplay issues aside from direct recommendation of issues currently the assembly hall is the only way to conduct a fair poll of players with easy to interpret results as evidenced by the pair of poll threads on the nano nerf while such threads are not appropriate for all issues and can choke out new ideas on the forum if too many are created they are a valuable method of finding out the opinion of the players on especially contentious issues therefore i will create poll threads from time to time to determine the opinion of the players on especially controversial topics
about memy name is alex sloat and i am a 22 year old living in brantford ontario canada who recently graduated with a bachelors degree in economics i am currently working as an office clerk for the local electrical company i have been heavily involved with political bodies of many sorts both partisan and not since i was 16 and have a great deal of experience with positions on elected bodiesin eve i play as herschel yamamoto an achura pilot specializing in gallentean combat ships and ive been playing for just under two years i engage in a wide variety of activities  i regularly do missions i harvest datacores i am in the process of setting up a cruiser bpc store i run a lottery and i engage in pvp both as a mercenary and a pirate as well as some other activities from time to time i have at some point done virtually every activity outside of 00 and even then i try to learn as much about how things work there as i can so that i can comment on it intelligently since the csm was announced i have taken a strong interest in the body and have been active in its processes ive read all the meeting minutes had conversations with many of the members provided a great deal of support work to the current council  most notably keeping the list of topics in the assembly hall up to date for serenity for two months before it became obvious that serenity was not paying attention anymore  and have been probably the most active and dedicated person around the csm who was not a member or alternateboth in real life and in game i am an active participant in what is going on in the world and i have no objection to working hard in order to make sure that i dont let those around me down or shirk my responsibilities
you call general game fairness as a topic for your csm position what are the main issues with the current state resp what would you change  adjustninjaediti mean could you be a bite more concrete with an example
hi tuskojust a quick question my friend  will the csms be looking into trying to convince ccp making headway in improving customer satisfaction and more ingame interaction with the playerbasei strongly feel this is a major issue for me as the divide between player and ccp staff is ever wideningi know in your other issues you can be more than trusted in representing the player base on numerous issues but i hardly ever see customer satisfaction being on a agenda where there seems to be many people disatisfied with how they are treat and with no recourse to formally complaingood luck with the election anyway

hello everyoneim announcing my candidacy to the 2nd csm after being disappointed of the overall performance of the last csm i realized i have something to bring to the csm as a whole to make things better i expect to represent everyone in this having taken part in just about every aspect of the game and having no interest in maintaining the current status quo on imbalanced issuesa page with more details can be found here
i know that vily has joined rzr welcome again mate but didnt notice that he is running for csm apart from the fact that he is a member of razor alliance imho it doesnt matter which entity any candidate belongs to i would vote even for a band of brothers member if he represents my thoughtsso please stay objective as i do we are talking about game developments and the future of eve not the future of 00 and its allocation
and if this proposed meeting had been announced by email ie in the same manner as all the previous ones then id as likely have been there i was online just not in eve i check the forums frequently but not always every dayjust noting iz
wait  you guys dont use msn or similar programs between each other
in that little coup meeting i organized we agreed on weekly meetings and if meeting after meeting gets deferred i suppose you can guess we are trying to get one done asapnot blaming you personally just very frustrated with the current affairs and the huge backlog as we havent dealt with issues properly since we sent off the second batch
the secondary goal of a new supply chain that doesnt convert readily back to minerals is to decouple the production stream from everything else made with minerals you can make space bling and fun pvp ships but not capitals and marketable goods so while the value is high the production almost has to flow into consumption instead of deflating the value of all the empire labor and miners etci can kind of see what youre saying about the riskreward of empire but i can make more in a halfassed fit domi in 00 in a few hours than i can for several in empire thats me but it still says a lot the barrier to 00 is very very low if all you want to do is join a 00 alliance and sidestep the whole grinding for standings thing yeah i have to watch local but seriouslyive lost one ratting ship in all of eve and only by being completely stupid and jumping headlong into a nanogang i fit up another one in five minutes because it seriously didnt put even a minor dent in my income overallone of the big challenges i think for making 00 work is the lack of economy im considering starting up a side project with ebank and a new crop of traders to try and go after that its quite possible to have a positive effect on the economic activity of a station by capitalizing a market and making the trips to empire less necessary not to mention that im richi could see the value of additional market infrastructure for supporting neutral traders being a big plus for 00 overall currently i live in a covopsrecon and survive on ramen noodles warmed up by overheating my mwd i can use my skillz to do most of the flying more places for good traders to settle down means more trade and that means less of a headache for the nontradesavyif space bling does one thing making those nightmares etc be accessible in bulk would certainly take the cool out of ratting up a cnrfor more ratting i think that would most certainly be a healthy thing for the game why on earth its a goal to get one ship when the game provides means of losing thousands is beyond me if shyt was cheaper we would see more losses would we see more people finally getting that carrier and never logging in again i just dont knowwhat point is the cake if you cant eat it moar ships moar pewpew more cake more getting fat on enjoying the game instead of grinding around to get an uber l33t mission setup so you can get suicided by a bunch of t1 ravens in hisec and scream on forums how youre going to quit the game
reasonable enough tell you what evemail me your email or make an account on shc and ill emailpm you a proposal for planetary interaction which would incorporate those aspects
you got my vote bro
warning this will be very boring and take multiple sections to flesh out but it is meant for those inclined to get an idea of what i am suggesting to have a look under the hood so to speak of what a system for planetary assets might be like if ccp choose to make it in reality an average player wouldnt need to figure all these things out or completely know how they are figured out the most important thing would be knowing the relationship between the various indicators all though for someone who really loves the inside mechanics and numbers these would be great to knowi ask that you be patient as i write this and post the various parts thank youpart one supply i start with this not because it is more important than demand but because it ends up being the most complex part of the model in many aspectsto demonstrate this model we will be using wheatan asset must produce a commodity that the corporation which sells it provides so for wheat it would be the following six companies further foodstuffs kador family prompt delivery combined harvest native freshfood and food relieffor a character to buy an asset in this case it would have to be in a system settled by one of these corporations the lower the security rating of the system the less expensive the asset could be and also a lower tax rate the character would also need at least a 60 standing with the corporationso let us say the character was to buy his wheat asset from the kador family so for this example the asset would be located on a planet within the kador prime regionnext wed figure out the max sustainable supply that the kador family corporations player run assets are capable of delivering for that region in this case kador for this wed take the corporations supplydemand statistic for wheat which in this case is 000936046937222164now we would multiply that by 25 to get 0234011734305541 and drop everything after the third decimal place for 0234 in the end lets call this the mass sustainable supply factor so it has a spiffy technical namenote i actually choose 25 here for purposes of demonstration later to demonstrate effect of mssf in reality id recommend it being carefully determined on a per commodity and per region basis and closely tied to the demand i chose 25 because it will interject some volatility into the model and give a better idea of what the other indicators are actually reflectingnow for the first time mssf is calculated we take the months highest volume for the commodity in a specific region where the asset is which would be 47412 in this case but after the first week the system would be in place id say it should be based on the average volume of the previous week rounding to the nearest whole number then we would add the mssf to the volume and round up to get the mass growth factor which would be 47412  0234 for a mgf of 47522 hereso for the kador region we can say that the most which can reasonably be supplied per day this week would be a mgf of 47522 units of wheat now we can make some other mechanics with this number to determine some other factorslet us add something called the mgf range and say it is  25 percent base meaning that on a given day the total wheat sold from the kador assets of wheat in kador prime to anywhere else in the cluster can in total be from 47403 rounded down to 47641 rounded up with no worry of under producing or over producing to the sustainable supply note more on the effect of that later when i get to asset specificscont
while we are at it lets also have something called the supply growth momentum this number for the first week that the system is in place would be 00 for all regions on all commodities but the way it is determined is this take the mgf and compare it to the previous weeks volumes for a region for this id recommend dividing the current mgf by 100 and then dividing each days average volume from the previous week by that result and dropping everything after the second decimal place giving us the following listsunday at 47461 9987 of mgfmonday at 47557 10007 of mgftuesday at 47495 9994 of mgfwednesday at 47613 10019 of mgfthursday at 47424 9979 of mgffriday at 47520 9999 of mgfsaturday at 47578 10011 of mgfnote these are made up numbers the real averages can vary wildly across a week with the current system it is my belief that they will regular out if the asset system were put in place or represent a point of volatility for a commodity under a corporation in a specific regionnow figure out the average for the week in percentage to mgf rounding to the nearest second decimal which would give us 9999 average to mgf for this week the sgm would be determined by difference between the average to mgf and one hundred percent so the sgm on wheat in the kador region for this week would be 001 percentthe sgm would be an important number it would show you the rate at which the corporations production for a commodity from a region can grow or shrink realistically without causing an upset to the regions assets to produce this would then be applied to the current weeks mgf range modifying it from the base  25 to a range of  26   24 for the current week but only the difference of the previous weeks sgm would be applied to each week after the first so if the following weeks sgm was 002 then the mgf range would be modified by 001 to  25 again 001  002  001 and this is done for a specific reasonsay you bought a single stock share at 050 cents and it fell to 025 cents that is a fifty percent loss on the stock but for that stock to raise back up now to its original value it has to increase by a full one hundred percent the reason the sgm is figured like this is so it reflects the reality of momentum if something is moving in one direction it takes twice as much work to get it moving in the other at the same ratean additional effect the sgm would have is to the mssf being we add the two together for a new mssf for the current week0234  001  mssf of 0224 for the second weekso the mssf is only calculated based on the corporations supplydemand statistic of a commodity for the very first week the system is in place but after that first week it is the previous weeks mssf and sgm that determine it for the current weeknote however that original first weeks mssf is important as an indicator historically as it will let you know how well the specific corporations asset and commodity have done over any length of time such as a business quarter or even six years seeing the mssf has gone from 0234 to 0198 in one quarter would let you know at a glance that there are real problems with the kador corporations wheat assets ability to supply in the kador regionnow given all the information above we could see what things would be at the start of the second week after the system is put in placefirst week ending  second week startingmssf  0234  0224mgf  47522  47628mgf range  47403 to 47641 25 an 25  47504 to 47743 24 an 26sgm  na  001 note this sgm only effects this week but the numbers generated from this week will determine it for next week
so what are these numbers showing about the kador wheat assets in the kador prime regionwell the mssf drop is showing that kador since the system was started is headed into a slowdown of its wheat production growth this is artificial though do to using 25 earlier when generating the starting mssf but as we look at the mgf increase along with the mssf we are inclined to think the growth of kador prime wheat production is out of sync with the growth of demand in the market and that local asset owners need to curb their development to be much slower to get back on track the mgf range seems to confirm this as it appears that wheat assets production can afford to deliver less and not be concerned with a state of under production lastly the sgm means they just did not sell has much wheat on average as they did last week and that market volume droppedso why this supply model to get only thatthe main point of this model is to break up factors to not make it so easy to produce and sell the correct amount from week to week also it limits what a region can realistically sell in a week or how much it can increase its production and not upset the market no matter how many assets may be producing and selling to marketanother point to consider is the model ignores a concept of true price and correct supply to match demand i hope this becomes much clearer after i illustrate the supply side in the second part and the actual asset specifics in the third but to clarify supply and demand should never meet exactly this model is meant to make that relationship fuzzy and generally stay within a range of each other but it is also meant to allow bubbles crashes and booms to form and take place
you may want to put this in your assembly hall thread not in the speakers forumalso i dont think that eve needs a virtual market if we need passive production methods we can create passive real asset production which we can then produce assets that are valuable to the greater eve population while planetary interaction is a good thing to develop this is not the direction it should be goinga better direction would be the production of and automatic logistics of pos fuels and moon mineral allocation
thanks for correcting me on that i thought here was also a place to post on topics for the csm not just about the csm
the jita speakers forum is also supposed to be an idea exchange the assembly hall is only for finished ideas for raising to ccp
this thread is about the specifics of a proposal already in the assembly hall
we have we did we were also adults about it and listened to their responses aside note how many proposals which have already been answered  some in the affirmative  get reposted as new requests to the csm as people cant be bothered to check first and even then we questioned them when they said it couldnt be done and when they said it will be done and we got plenty of those too we asked when and how soon and told them which we believe the players would like to get in firstyou dont have an idea for something new or improved in eve and release it a week later or a month later and maybe it might be a full year later but weve been promised that many of the suggestions we took from you the players are being added to the development pipeline and one day they will appear i already note in the coming expansion some things we on the csm have discussed with ccp and the devs the csm may not have been what was originally hoped for but it does have a record of success already and has changed the way ccp have viewed some of the eveonline universe so instead of attacking us work to make the csm even more successful insteadiz
gotta say i kinda like the ideahaving fueled that way in elite long long long agoyeah it would have to be almost suicidal from a risk perspective it would also have to be incredibly time intensivewith those two huge disadvantages it would be best to mine ice and only do a harvest in the worst of all worst case scenarios
personally if you killed hundreds of my men no amount of talking and money would get you into good graces with mehowever this is a game and should be fun and flexible
glad i did not do that power of two
gtc price hike  rl economic woes  no ghost training fallback  consolidate accounts
patience and persistenceremoving ghost training was probably the worst move in eve historyincreasing monthly cost i can understand even tho it sucked but this unforgivable unless revokedtiv
i agree ghost training brings players back to the game its like a cookie jar u get bored of the cookies in there u leave them for abit and you find some new ones put in so you return but if you take the new ones away you think meh i see why i left these alone and if they still bring this through at least do the idea for training multiple accounts at once we pay for the three account slots we want to use them and train 3 at once its the same as ghost training but opposite we actually pay for them
come the revolution whoever removed ghost training is 1st up against the wall ok maybe 3nd after simon cowell and michael portillo
i support this
i dont use ghost trainingbut i support the long time players with this option that is here for 5 yearseve is a great game dont change to much
u turn needed on this change  bad idea ccp
this is a betrayal to all eve community i cant believe that ccp would pull the rug under so many peoples feet in a time like this
give back the feature you cut out of the game after over half a decade
i and all my alts say that this change is good
1 it was handled by ccp for 5 years as established feature2 it certainly influenced design decisions profoundly required skill portfolios for new ships or equipment training difficulty for new skills aso3 it was a primary reasons that some of the insane required real life training times on some skills were tolerated4 it basically increases the cost to build up alts and by that experience alternate gamestyles by up to 50 5 the in conjunction with the lost flexiblity by the removal of 30 days and increased cost by that of 90 days gtcs the upkeeping of secondary accounts became exponentially more diffcult if not prohibitive for many players6 it removes a major motivation for returning to the game after a break7 it cements the allready huge gaps between established and new players 8 
bring back ghost training
10 days to quit probably for good this time
been a couple of good years but this time i quit for good i think
return ghost training
a 5 year bug give me a break terrible decision and dressed up so so badly
i am throwing in my vote as well i think a skill queue of 56 skills would be excellent it would benefit all players and especially people who have limited logon time or the possibility of not being able to logon at all we are all paying a monthly fee or buying time cards so i think we should be able to set a queue to advance our skills in case we are unable to logon for skill changesya know the whole rl thing comes up at time 
yes fully supported
i forgot to addmany people play eve because they want to be involved in a mmorpg but dont have the time to grind levels to progresslong skills are great for these poeple but they really miss out on the short skills you must consider that even vets when they tyrain a new branch of skills have a bunch of lvl 14 to do and a skill que would really boost these players and attract more
signedimplement with certificates please
yes even if its just for 2 skills it would be a great boon for people who have lives
although this feature would make especially sense for new charactersthat function should have been introduced ages ago so yes
there is no excuse now ccp login to change skills is not playing
signed
it only makes sense to do thisccp say that for quantum rise they have included many things that the player base has been asking for chances are this isnt in it but what the hey
something is needed to be given back to those who didnt abuse ghost training and lived on 30d gtcs
support
supported
bump for an important topic
having smarbombs being able to reduce incoming damage is still somewhat important but having them able to completely neutralise all incoming damage from missiles with just a 12 smartbombs is a little over the top
now before everyone cites me for a hypocrite i have used this forum in the past and still continue to watchpost in this forummy problem is anyone can post in a forum that is actively watched by the csmhopefully while in reality all it is is another faucetforum for people to post their suggestions ideas whines bugs nerf this or boost this posts these forums are already in place with game development features  ideas and the eve general discussion the csm should already be looking at the features and ideas forum as well as game development the assembly hall is where the pod pilots can show their support for the issues the csm bring forward then after seeing the support or lack there of can decide to take it to a vote or not during the csm meetingi propose that the ability to make new posts in this forum be reserved only for ccp and the csm now once a post is made anyone can reply to the thread in support for or against the idea thumbs down proposal 
supporting my idea to only allow the csm to post threads here ccp excluded and all others can only reply while giving their thumbs up or hopefully at somepoint thumbs down on the issues
best post so far this month
agreed also it is just doesnt make any sense to present an idea here soon it gets confusing as to what exactly is being supported as many support post state they only support an issue if it conforms to some addition of their own that makes it entirely to hard i would imagine for the csm to determine what the issue  solution they will be debating and approaching ccp about even is
now the problem can arise that your csm can start bring forth pet projects that really wasnt something the main playerbase was asking for same thing happens with real life elected officialsas a balance hopefully the csm would site links to the other forums when they start a topic so the pyramids of discussion are still hashed in the main forum while leaving this forum mainly for a support dont support ill support if then else type environmentbut i didnt want to put that as a mandatory requirement in my request but i do feel it should still be encouraged if my proposal is widely accepted and finally adopted by ccp
if we used that system wed barely have any topics at all and mostly dumb ones that only selfserve the csm membersinstead this forum should be moderated there are too many whine threads ideas and spam threads in the ah that never get moved ah has become a dumping ground for terrible ideas and random insignificant ing threads leaving gd terribly empty
i cant support this proposal  itd stifle the democracy that the csm is supposed to be promotinghowever i do agree with what i think is your main complaint  the forums utterly lack definition and as such they all just form an undifferentiated mess ive always thought of the assembly hall as the place for finalized proposals submitted in a form where theyre immediately usable by the csm and the other forums as place for idea development jita park should be used for topics about the csm only  candidate threads meeting minutes and idea development for ideas about the csm  things like how can the csm better communicate with players and what should we use as rules of order id be entirely in favour of putting a sticky at the top of the assembly hall to identify exactly what the csm expects to see out of threads here to attempt to clean up this mess players should be encouraged to participate directly but they should also be encouraged to keep everything in the right forum
i had a tldr post like verone with a lot of the same stuff but i deleted it because it was so long and boringxl smartbomb is a terrible ideanew scripts are cool but tradeoffs must be madeno solopwnmobile for youpersonally id rather have a brand new utility module than just a slightly changed one
this
againsti fly minmatare ships more then half year mostly bs if minmatare wouldnt have speed they die very quick even in pvethey now have useless arty and only ac and speed may equivalent it with other race pitty why i canceled train my caldari character then ccp boost missiles and they will be uber nerf web and all guns will be space trashlook at minmatares all of them train ammarian ships do you know anyone from other race who want train minmatare ships or projectile artyi like eve but ccp dont do it worst for people who want still stay with you
totally against this movei say nerf the blob instead
i say nerf them both nanos and blobbers ruined this game
i agree to the fire and forget for stealth bomber bombs and tbh it should be the same for missiles just imo
i would also like to throw my support into this thread bombs should be fired and the pilot able to recloak in 23 seconds provided he isnt locked and try to escape i have been messing around with the sbs for a short while and i cant really find any use for them as of yet they cant use the cov ops cloak the cruise missiles are a joke and the bombs cost to much for what you get from themi think the pilot should be able to cloak after launching and just give the bomb a dmg penalty based off of bomb launcher skill lvl cloaking skill lvl and cov ops skill lvl the higher those skills the less of a dmg penalty you are hit with after cloaking maybe i am slightly crazy but i enjoy the thought of all the michief i could get into with a proper working sb
well there are lots of things that i use my stealth bomber for with cruisesbut yes i would like to see the bombs given the fire and forget mode with a range optionit would also be interesting to make a lazer guided bomb where you can have it lock onto a large ship or structure that is being target painted
two weeks ago i set all of my client background and window theme colors to cheery hues of blue ive started catching myself thinking eve is a very cheery game in fact its getting more cheerful every day however the opening scenes of the client are still dull gray in fact there are a lot of things about eve that could be modified to adapt better to players stylesproposal specificsopening theme responds to client changes before logging in alternate color schemes configurable for the launcherthe planet centered at the login screen is a blue earthy looking planet fit for a barbecue and probably packed with pleasant korean women who enjoy sunbathing karaoke and shochu twinkling stars on a glistening frosty ribbon of winterthe alternate color scheme can remain a lowkey option to preserve the theme the devs are going for but a radio button is added to the character creation system somewhere before the portrait creation that says i am not a manic depressive the other button will be pressed by default but will not have a description listed necessarilythe character creation system will have an alternate pallet of nonfreakish matar and nongothy amarr options but will be referenced to the regular counterparts for those to busy playing the game in the fast lane of the down the highway not across the road mode if youre on cheery you see the new options and otherwise you see the counterparts from the existing abnormal systemthe gallante will have baseball caps cigarettes puma logo gear and will be able to psychically detect when someone is about to play anything rakim and proceed to hit every beat and add good vibrations to the universeless relevant but an alternate forums color scheme that automatically turns all orange tags to blue no grey on every other post as black looks cleaner and less depressingthank you for your timetldrproposing minor alternate options to play in a parallel universe with a proxy artistic scheme to cover up the dizasta caused by the closing of the eve gate and subsequent loss of all contact with humanity

i fully support this thread now i now realize that if1 datacores canceled 2 sell orders canceled 3 rp collection canceled will make me allot of isk in game sorry for disagreeing with you shar it was a principal thing before now that we can no longer finish training while inactive i think we should really go for the gold and this is actually a thought out change of mind here not being facetious at all
you do have to wonder tho how many inactive accounts are there just accumulating datacoresi hadnt really even thought about it until i read this thread but farming isk on an inactive accout seems like a way to progress in the game without paying to me and is blatently unfair to the honest playeri really cant see how ccp could justify letting this continue considering the comments made in the dev blog abotu why they stopped ghost traininglets hope ccp are true to their word and stamp this kind of exploitation of an unintended feature out asap
if it can be done to only trigger the timer while under aggression from a player not an npc getting a ctd in the middle of a mission or something would suck ass with a 5 minute log off timer
ive had client crashes in the past month and days with never ending disconnects so nope
the log off timer when aggroed by a player before ctrlq is 15 minutes so exactly what you want 23 minutes after decloacking  23 minutes after the first shot against someone that has already logged off 23 minutes before emergency warp or what
just fix it already dont care how
game and server can differentiate whether crtlq was pressed or game was killed from task manger or real network problem occureddo not increase logoff timermay be even reduce it just put proper code to address this issue
yes but can it differentiate between a real network problem and you pulling out your network cablevenkul mul has this one exactly right
i vote for the nerf
guess its nanonerf ftw
support this
i approve of this proposal
one of the things that really set eve apart from the rest
prolly been discussed before but i have an idea ccp needs to come up with some way for players to challenge these bot miners right click a miner and issue a challengesay a simple mathematical challenge out of a selection of five no response within a minute and bingothe miner turns red i know its simplistic but hey something needs to be done about the isk miners afk miners could stop mining for a fewdunno much about mining thoughsuggestions thoughts flames
hello captinteresting idea but i dont think its really feasable i had a different idea posted on my website on how to get rid of both the bots and afk miners
hiya bunnyalong the same lines as yours but players do the raiding give missioners some fun and a change of pace try to leave the devs out just an announcement that triggers some kind of flag where they are fair game after 5 minred to everybody for say 15 min
no i dont see it bringing anything good to eve
because it would ruin specialization in eve why bother getting a friendcorpmate with specialized skills to do something when you can have an alt to do anything you wantagreed with one amendmentallow 3 characters to be trained on a single account at 13 speedallow 1 character to be trained at normal speedtraining does not need to be sped up
i am inclined not to support this idea due to the whole characterfarming thing but if they would then implement something like kahega mentioned then maybei created a second character but then sent her to the biomass queue as the training time would have interfered with this ones training and as he wants to be a fullyfledged mining director flying hulks i couldnt let anything interfere with that ab
this should be implemented with some kind of training speed penalty when training multiple chars in same acc
brilliant
all mmos operate on a timemoneypower system the longer you keep your account the more youve paid for it and the more powerful it becomesother mmos require that you actually play your character to power it up xp grind so it isnt possible to train multiple characters simultaneously in those games either unless they are on seperate accountsccp would be taking money out of their own pocket by allowing this unless they allowed you to train all three but have them train at 13 the rate at which they train today changing it to be 3x the current rate would be a slap in the face to those who have paid 5 years of sub fees to skill their character up to where it is nowwhat you could do is have a tiered system of accounts liketrain 1 character 1495 a monthtrain 2 characters 2700 a monthtrain 3 characters 4000 a monthit basically gives you a discount over what having 3 accounts would cost which makes sense becuase if you had 3 accounts you could play them at the same timesorry guys but game time is what ccp has to sell and becoming more powerful over time is one of the primary ways that they keep you interested in buying it you arent going to get them to massively devalue their own product

character farming is playing the game then selling your character so everybody is a potential char farmer and everybody who sold a char is a char farmer my solution is simple to stop char farming stop char trade hell if i could train 2 chars i wouldnt need to buy oneinteresting i thought farming included paying to train a char upthats what you tell me anyway so if its free it shouldnt be farmingseriously eve has more than 3 specialties you mention only 4 and imply there are more by using etc but i still have only 3 slotseve may be an mmo but ccp does not want to obligate everyone to multiplay nor does it obligate everyone to roleplay mmo means you can interact not that you are obligated todoes nobody care that char farming is possible as long as you pay ccp for it basicly people are kind of saying char farmingalts should not be available to poor people who only pay 15 eurosmonth ccp democracytmkind of thingbut maybe i missed the point of these extra char slots perhaps they are for storing old chars you get tired off not building new ones
from beta to release ccp removed skilling on 3 characters to 1 in order to draw out the advancement process over a long period of time in order to milk players of subscriptions over a long period of time and also to force serious players into paying more than one subscription in order to reach the same baseline service enjoyed in other games players think that skill advancement while offline is somehow a feature made for their convenience its not same as the above this was done to make advancement take a long time so youd pay ccp more money if skilling happens by a clock not by your effort then it doesnt matter if three players take 8 hours shifts to play a character 24 hours a day that character is still going to take forever to skill up same as the account manned by a casual player who only logs 10 minutes a month to change skills what if people didnt pay for multiple accounts and spend years skilling up in order to reach some kind of plateau in personal advancement well then ccp might actually have to make some content for their game rather than just a sandbox and thats never going to happen ccp likes stringing you out for years on multiple subscriptions while giving you free expansions that are only 39mb big and a game thats only 3 gigs on the hard drive after over half a decade thats just too little work for too much money for them to change anything
we have had a few internal discussions about this recent removal of ghost training and while we did not agree on everything one of the things that came out was the anger over ccps communication with this issuenoone is going to buy that this was just a bug really a bug not fixed for over 5 years ha and the other reasons they gave were quickly interpreted by players as we want more moneythe csm has already brought up this problem after the change in the gametime codes that the players are angered that ccp said they are just conforming to industry standards which was an outright lie and more of those thingshowever ccp did not seem to take this particular concern very serious and iirc this point was even omitted from the final conclusion on that discussionnow they made the same mistake my question to you is what do you think of the current communication and how would you like to see it please try to be constructive and keep in mind that i plan to bring this issue before ccp again thanks
let me just play devils advocate here because i dont think this post was all that well writen it lacks perspectiveits more like an unintended featureno world of warcraft has set the industry standard they only offer 60 day cards thus it cant be a liepeople were angered about the nano nerf people were angered about the t20 incident people were angered about the carrier nerf as i pointed out shortly after the first csm had taken seat in office ccps communicate sux epicly they arent communicating and their moderation team keeps screwing upjust look at how they locked our ghosttraining voting threadwe cant make ccp communicate however everybody should tell ccp what they feel at fanfest to be frankly honest csm shouldnt be the only mean of telling this to ccp talking to ccp employees face to face is much more effectivehowever im very much afraid of how you are going to raise an issue about this how are you going to make ccp improve itself if you dont know the actual background for all they have done thus far how is it not just going to be i think you should improve communication because i think it sux at the momentdevilsadvocate
no there are a lot of sore losers out there that are nitpicking a small line in the player guide and are making a big deal out of nothingccp rushed a dev blog and replied more than enough in the megathreadwe could use a way to see ccp responses in mega threads since no one wants to sift through 20 pages of whiners to get to itif you think a company has to explain itself and announce in big bold letters we are trying to make money here then you are out of your mind i have news for you all for profit companies are in it to make money to think otherwise is foolish and childishit is a clear and demonstrated fact that ccp communicated with the players and fully explained themselves if you think ccp are lying or misleading the people then by all means get some proof or stfu
how bout spending some of the cash theyre making on training their customer service techniques to their employees  and conforming to those industry standardsmaybe run a small pr campaign too  their image needs to be polished up a bit
the communication in that instance was an utter disastermanaging to squeeze three lies into the space of two paragraphs and somehow give the whole thing this insulting argumentative even defensive tone was quite the achievementit was like they were trying to  me off people who want my money normally have the good sense not to do thatbearing in mind that im not stupid that eve is a frippery and that theres plenty of other things to spend that money on i think they should give more thought to how they do those things in the futurethe customer isnt always right but the customer is always the customeryes even in mmo land i dont care how much ass burgers you got
well personally i think the csm is a lie and ccp just gave us the illusion that we had the power to make things change but in the end they do what they want when they want and how they wantafter ccp lied about the ghost training removal i am now convinced that the players will be more and more disappointed  because you cant massively go after money and then think for one second that your customers will be happy with whatever choice you force down their throat dont misunderstand me  i am not protesting against the ghost training removal  i only used it twice without abusing it i thought this was a very cool featurebut in the end like always ccp tend to punish everyone for a small problem  its always the case 
your post merely reaffirms my belief that not only will ccp not apologise for what they did wrong they dont even think theyve done anything wrongas such attempting a dialogue with them is pointless because they dont even understand why were angry theyre utterly out of touch and even if they werent theyre obviously desperate for money wtb 30m investment that disappeared like morning frostand really dear anhk the fact that youre even making this post smacks of desperation disillusionment shines through your every sentence oh dear all those noble dreams and sweet promises in your election video
well then why dont you stop overloading the database about it
well for me this issue atm does not effect me personnally but i can feel for those it does affecti have been in game close to 4 12 years and my anger is more directed at the total lack of thought that went into this change hardly no warning apparent non caring attitude towards the playerbase  treating the playerbase with disrespect with lies as to the reasons behind the changeive seen and put up with a lot in this game and although i love the game and community to bits and really beginning to hate the currant emphasis by ccp staff that they dont careive had about 4 petitions in my time for ship loss due to lag bugs etc always get the same response of our logs dont show anything typical copypaste replyevery single member of the gms ive talked to dont even show any sympathy etc coupled with the lack of playerbase interaction im firmly of the opinion ccp just wants money and doesnt care whatsoever if people leave this last incident for me is just another example of the heavy handed draconian way ccp treats its customersive stopped the eon subscription long ago over a incident with the eve shop and never bought anything from there sincethis year will be my last visit to fanfest in iceland where i will be voicing my opinionsi would stop my spare accounts if i didnt enjoy the company of my friends ingame as much as i do all eve is for me now is a expensive chat engine lolccp has no clue whatsoever how to talk to its playbase or deal with complaints and issues in that respect ccp fail miserably
what some people dont understand is a consumers role in thisyou are the consumer you have the power to say hey i dont like this product any more im going elsewhereand the company goes ohh guys we stuffed up holy hell and hopefully reverse the changethe thing i never got was the we are conforming to industry standards  in an industry that spends so much time to make its product much like ccp did with eve totally unique and different because said industry is built on it well it is just wrong it makes no sense to say hey were conforming because this week its this next week its ambulation and the week after that is a facinating new few races of orcs and elves and more oh mygive ccp hell guys after nerfing this game so hard then hurting the playerbase both with timecards and then this just gives more reasons why they need to start listening for oncerealise this if this was a balance change because people who had little money could still play the game with those that have alot of money and can train whilst away from the game for a while isnt balance its not balance that us older players have had 5 years of on and off playing and on 247 training isnt fair balance eitherthis and the timecard changes are a severe money grab and tells me the consumer that something is wrong either a new suit who is a money hungry guy or the company is leaking money and failure is nearevery time a mmo has gone the we need more moneywere confomring to industry standards route it has fallen apart soon afterim getting out before it tanks come join me over at any of the different products with better companies
i underlined the key words
as a gtc reseller i agree with the op gtc prices have spiraled out of control and if prices keep rising then no one will be able to afford them when i do have gtcs i usually sell them at 475 mil which causes my screen to fill with convo requests as soon as i say i have themthe removal of the 30 day and 90 day cards was a big mistake for ccp i can understand they wanted to streamline their marketing database but they should have upgraded their database instead of reducing the calculations it had to make in addition the price for the 60 day cards is way out of line if they are an alternative to paying with credit  debit card then they need to match the price that the game costs 1495 x 2  2990 if they lowered the price by just a few dollars then i think this would solve the problem with the lower supply
it really doesnt have a lot to do with the removal of the cards guys though since the ghost training nerf you may see a return of the 30 day cards since its likely that their removal was a first attempt at doing the same thingits just good old supply and demand you have less people willing to part with extra money over and above what their subscription costs theyre less certain about their jobs and their finances short of fixing the economy there isnt much that ccp can do about itthe ghost training nerf might help some it will probably incent people to drop some of the extra accounts theyve been carrying and the demand may go down
unless it actualy brings the prices up p lets face it inactive accounts that can train  dont need gtcs  therefore less demandso theres a chance that no ghost skilling may bring more demand if this becomes true  then theres a chance we will see prices reach the billion isk sometime soon but fear not  if it does  quite a few people will leave the game and demand will drop i am seeing people struggle in keeping up with the isk required to keep their main account activeand yeswith world financial crisis we all have less to spend on nonessentials like eve blasphemyi know well one things for sure  we will see more super caps ingame if your getting a billion isk per gtcmayb its worth ccp considering capping the sale price sometime soon or we may just see a universal financial crisis in eve to match the current world finacial crisis
i find the ghost training change to be perfectly acceptable but agree that it was managed poorly by ccp they were justified in making the change but it would have been a far better to give a reasonable amount of warning so that those who had been playing by longheld ccp policies were given a chance to adapt and if its true they suppressed reasonable debate on the matter they were wrong to do sonot sure what gtc prices have to do with anything since gtc prices are playerdriven
sure let the csms run with itmight drive home to more people exactly how ccp dont really care and the csm is just a pr tool
since im a honest decent paying customer i say to hell with the ghost training
i suppose thats a good principle for the balance teams to keep in mind although they already do to some extent but i have no idea where youre going with it
i agree to a certain extent their are ships whos role is now designed role is now obsolete except in unusual situations or for new players that could do with some tweaking or rp wise major cluster wide upgrade payed for by to make them more common of course since im an industrialist im biased towards giving my self a bigger market 
ccp made waiting for skill completion while away from eve impossible for their reasons they will not reverse this i think nohow can we speed up learning these x12 skills to learn them in reasonabletime and throw away at least a bit of playing in standby mode 6 7 implants or maybe  more just to be fair it will take amount of playtime and play activities to get those items but in the same time will make long skills a bit faster to get we talk about 5 lvls what do you think
i havent used ghosttraining so far since im a new player but looking at my skillplan to fly something bigger then a battleship i understand why it got abusedused to its maximumimho something needs to be done to keep players playing and paying while training timesinks like adv spaceship command to lvl 5 tbh i dont know if another isksink like 7 implants would be good solution cause even the 5 implants are very expensive imho at least for me 
i have no idea why training cant be accelerated by use of a skillfor instance interceptors i yeah generally you want at least 3 if not 4 levels on a skill but why cant you get accelerated learning through actually flying an interceptor whilst it trainssome skills would need a slightly different calculation for instance shield management and other support skills shield cap armour skills but could still have their training reduced in certain scenarios the game itself can be really good at times the training does have its benefits at times but is also a bit stale and dull
its not like ghost training made anything faster it just made it cheaper in terms of rl dollars nothing needs to be sped up as a result of its removal and that includes the proposal for better implants asc 5 is a timesink yes but its a timesink whether you are paying for your account or not you might as well get some money while youre at it
7 baby better yet lets have a 10 implant set

now which of all of those had a broad and long backing in the features and ideas discussion forum and which were merely pet projects of the championing delegate or slapped on there due to some assembly hall trenddid you at all comb the former forum for material or just count thumbs in this place
check your facts and news post several months ago ccp posted the meeting minutesnotes dont have acrobat on this machine yet so i cant check but iirc all those issues were on the meeting minutesnotes
update please
the pilots name was cyvok with ascn and the avatars name was steve and was wiped out by bob in c9ncc where ccp put a monumentfor those who were wonderingmost of my ships are called below the belt and i just attach a 1  2  3 etc on them on how many ive lost of the ship typei like this idea on supercapitals but what if you come to sell it wouldnt it limit the buyers if they dont like the fact youve called your aeon super pink and fluffy ice cream maker
if it is as simple as changing the skin then i can live with that however i agree with several other people that they need to rework the entire mission system although that is not the purpose of this thread
more bc more bs
i think most people think that ccp wont listen or the csm wont have any effectbut then again most people dont think about the longterm effects weve had almost a hundred issues so far and only half a dozen were actually implemented in the game or known to be in the shortterm release pipelineand of those issues a lot of people think meh ccp already had that planned what do we need the csm fori agree that things could have been better especially the communication both between us and ccp and between us and the players however this is a longterm process and this is just the beginning
well its basic psychology humans dont move unless there is a subjacent motivation which provides subjective benefits vs the overhead required by the tasksome csm candidates act under the conviction that the whole community can benefit from their interventions other ones are there merely to push an hidden agenda nothing new its also like that in rl politics since humanity existsi can only have compassion for players being manipulated that way by ccp my beef is that the job could have been performed efficiently and silently without integrating aspects like representatives egos hidden interests and subjectivity which invariably mess things up unless all candidates are living examples of wisdom and with all due respect eve is certainly one of the last places i would look for wisdom
the issue at hand here is not if the csm is effective since its effectiveness is solely function of ccps obscure decision processes based on we dont know what set of criterias on a casebycase basis and therefore totally out of controlrather the question is why did ccp come up which such an intricate concept both in design as implementation when things could have been done simply while providing a much higher degree of objectivity by avoiding the pitfalls implied by any kind of representative system its all the difference between form vs substance
i think theres several reasons to it1 its a social experiment ccp xhagen who created the csm studies philosophy it might be a product of his mind to see how it would turn out2 a better community trough standards by the elected representatives the current state of the eveo forum is extremely sad one could imagine ccp had hoped that the csm would set the standard you could argue it did for this term the csm document is actually fairly explicit about this 3 better communication with the community you could argue that the csm allows for more communication with ccp by providing a 2way communication with csm as the moderator however it has had the effect that ccp seemingly communicates less with us on certain key issues however they should certainly not hear from anyone that they dont let us in on what they are working on the recent spew of dev blogs and the like was certainly to be expected despite the amount of whine which thought ccp was ignoring the community however their communication on things like the alliance tournament is really badthats what i can come up with for now
philosophy is a very interesting field but except for juggling with abstract concepts absolutely useless in eves framework unless you crossreference it with real  documented data here structural anthropology comes much more handy since it provides philosophical analysis of models which have been implemented here or there at some time in human history check claude lUFFFDvi strauss for example i wouldnt state is as sad like it or not its just the mere reflection of a reality artificially hiding it will not induce any behavioral evolution genuine changes are often the result of providing constant and longterm behavioral examples instead of working through brute forcewhen a moneymaking venture is led by a directorate which isnt submitted to an accountability framework on fact finding missions analysts decision processes and subsequent implementations the resulting behavior can sometimes be erratic as long ccp isnt a traded company led by a board of directors whose position can be put in jeopardy at each shareholders meeting according to their performance dont expect too much alliance tournaments  i stopped to bother from 2006 on the day ccps referee wasnt even able to follow their own set of rules by popping my ship which left a can at 80 km from said referee who was located at the center of the battlefield under the pretext that i had crossed the 100 km radius of the arena
this is just my best guesses for factors that make many people continually stay within high sec and id like to hear how as a csm rep you would advise ccp in dealing with them if they did appear to be true 1 you get too many people in too small a place that was originally designed to meet the needs of starting characters2 people in a virtual world exhibit antisocial levels of greed or intolerance for loss the real life legal consequences for greed do not exist and the social consequences of the behavior are not strong enough to deter it 3 survivability is fairly easy as an individual in high sec compared to the harder work and social skills needed to thrive as a group in low sec so social ties and need to develop team work skill can remain quite weak in a large amount of the player basethe above three conditions lead to opportunistic economics much like inequality leads to street crime and it progresses to a worsening and constant cycle from there which comes to a head with the belowtoo much unrewarding work for two a low risk that leads to unrealistic perceptions of the moderate risks the game designers envisioned put simply for many players to lose the ship they spent two or more weeks grinding missions mining tradinghauling in thirty seconds isnt worth it no matter how unlikely that is the ship is given unrealistic value by the investment of spare time playing the game to acquire it even though they can most likely make the amount to cover that ships loss in low sec much faster a fear of being unlucky and being back to dull game play for two weeks oddly enough keeps them pursuing low risk low reward game play and worse off this effect stacks so one ends up working longer dull game play activities to get that ship they think they can make it in low sec with but when they finally do have the skill and isk for it that ship also gets an unrealistic sense of value given the time taken to work for itthis causes player progression to low sec and 00 to slow down and creates a bottle neck effect parts where the designers envisioned a two month player working to progress are over run with six month characters consuming everything it starts a slowing of the ability of newer characters to progress and allows time for the unrealistic senses of risk that many develop toward 00 to sink inand best luck on the election
watching the first csm session with great interest the most glaring problem to me was the lack of representation for the 00 side of eve i consider the 00 endgame and warfare in it to be driving force that pushes eve forward empire space serves some essential services to this endgame but its primary role should be to get players adjusted to eve before they head out to 00 and enjoy the greatest player versus player combat available anywhere in any gameif elected i will represent not only existing 00 players but more importantly those who aspire to play in 00 but find the barriers to entry too high or would like to play in 00 if only it wasnt plagued by lag blobs powerblocks doomsdays mindnumbing starbase warfare mechanics and insensitive gms who cant find their logsspecifically i identify three main problem areas
1 customer supportpetitions are still too slow it often takes 34 replies before you get a real answer from a human being when youre seeking reimbursement the logs are usually claimed to show nothing at first but if you persist and escalate a senior gm often finds the evidence players feel like theyre being deceived and their time is being wasted many petitions become closed because the player gives up not because their problem has been fully investigated and some of those players eventually leave eveimportant bugs which cause regular loss of ingame assets do not get the attention they deserve it will soon be four years since the exodus ui overhaul and the overview background color bug introduced then still exists and still causes newer players to shoot the wrong targets for the last 12 months more capital ships seem to be lost due to desyncs than real combat yet that bug is neither fixed nor detected for reimbursement purposes its clientside and gms frequently blame the players computer for the problem forgetting perhaps that ccp wrote the client software loss of assets representing hundreds of hours of gametime to unpredictable bugs causes dissatisfaction and leads to petitions the replies to which which cause further dissatisfactionplayers naturally talk to each other so even a relatively low number of such cases has left a very deep level of dissatisfaction within the whole playerbase its clear ccp recognises a problem with their customer support but they lack a player perspective when it comes to solving itmasshiring more gms who dont understand eves complex game mechanics but are supplied with a set of generic replies is not the answer instead critical bugs need fixing faster no matter how intractable they appear better item tracking event logging and associated gm tools are needed core policies on reimbursement and other gms interventions need to be reviewed with input from players
2 00 warfare problemsthe problems with territorial warfare starbases and sovereignty are well documented and to a surprising extent agreement on what is wrong has been reached unfortunately every player seems to have their own ideas on how to revamp the system some are wishful silver bullet suggestions if only local didnt exist all would be well many are extremely detailed and well thought out suggestions but nothing sets them apart from other completely different extremely detailed and well thought out suggestions ccp is understandably left confused tries something and then finds that huge sections of the playerbase rebel against the proposed changeccps professional game designers have shown incredible talent and foresight time and again when coming up with innovate well balanced and fun gameplay they dont always get it right but i believe theyre in a much better position than players to design the necessary gameplay changeswhats needed is for players to reach consensus on what the longterm goals should be for evolving 00 warfare ccp can then design in the details incrementally and players can be confident that things are headed in the right direction even if they dont agree with every individual changein my view we need to work on lengthening and slowing combatmultihour long continuous battles which would have seemed fanciful when eve was first released are now a reality and are a lot of fun for both sides win or lose the longest battles typically involve a carrier group tied down by a larger attacking subcapital fleet in a cynojammed system and not in immediate danger with both sides reinforcing with extra ships and subbattles occasionally erupting along supply lines or at other points in the same system this is a fairly specific situation but it could serve to inspire gameplay changes in similar situations where one side has significant assets titan capital fleet starbases and other infrastructure on a battlefield and another force is attacking them the current mechanism for killing starbases seems almost to discourage ongoing combat as an effective timeout is called for a day or two while both sides gather a blob the introduction last summer of the ability to incapacitate and repair starbase modules did help a bit but some more fundamental redesign is clearly neededdoomsdays and dreadnoughts unfortunately tend to shorten combat by providing quick death to subcapital and capital ships respectively they also provide powerful disincentives to combat even beginning in the first place they hurt smaller alliances who consistently get whacked by rich alliances titans and massive dreadnought fleets with neither side experiencing much fun and they encourage powerblocking as alliance leaders seek to pull together the biggest dreadnought fleet possiblewars should be battles of mental and financial attrition not wholly dependent on set piece engagements or frequently nonengagements where the side that brings the most people takes the trophy by default
3 supercapitalseve has a complex well balanced and extremely enjoyable core combat engine adding doomsdays to that engine was pure vandalism and they need to be removed or severely limited i have doomsdayed several hundred ships and its not fun for me either titans need a new defensive logistical or tactical battlefield role to replace the doomsdaymotherships lack a significant unique role that justifies their build cost and their status as supercapitalsboth supercapital classes are too gankable the fun they provide to both sides during their death throws should reflect their build cost they should die because one side made a series of sound tactical decisions on the battlefield and the other side consistently got it wrong not because they suffer a bit of lag at a critical moment its a paradox that by making capital ships harder to destroy we would probably see a lot more deployed and in turn a lot more would actually be destroyed
who am imy name is vuk lau the same name as my main ingame character im 30 years old and live in belgrade in serbia im blessed with the best wife on earth who totally understands my passion for eve and even wakes me up to doomsday badguys
you got my 7 votes
good to see another known face on the elections good luck and all i hope we will meet in the council
o vuktrying to be impartialsince the csm is all encompassing of issues dealing with evewhat are your views on highseclowsec piracyyou talk about a few bugs that have never been touched years after they still exsist besides the color background overview what other bugs would you be actively seeking to have removed from the gamewhat are you views on the arguements foragainst modifying local chat changing cloaking to be probable falcons need nerfd to helli 3 ya vuk btw but these are some issues that can be a deal breaker for my votes
ive followed the csm pretty well and from what we have access to as players i certainly consider lavista vista a pretty good candidate for second termi applaud his comunication skills and his general outlook as well as his contributions to the community he is not afraid to argue a differing point of view and if he spots something is wrong he says solavista vista has the vote of my accounts
welcome to the party
welcome i love your way of thinking even if your view on the current view of the council is somewhat flawed for which i cant blame you since there hasnt been a great deal of communicationthe current council has however had problems with communication and general participation i have personally tried a forumbased system for discussions to offload the meetings but there simply hasnt been enough activity on the forum to make it workthis is inherently a problem about people while we can dramatically improve which i hope to work with people like yourself in assuming we get elected how do we make sure people take the council seriously and dedicate the time there is needed to make the council worki wish you best of luck i hope to see you on the council to be frankly honest
thanks for the words of support even if i can safely assume i dont have your vote as for the forums the system can only really work if it includes accountability to the players right now the forums are hidden which means that theres no way for me as an outsider to see what happens on them aside from my objection to formal decisions being made behind closed doors this also has the effect of providing no incentive to work hard and participate besides the will of the individual  theres no concern about looking bad and possibly messing up your reelection if nobody can see that you make one post a month and if another member does start mentioning that to inform the voters it just looks like internal drama that turns everybody off the system as a whole in order for forums to work they have to provide the same ultimate level of accountability to the csms constituents as the current textchat meetings people may not pay a lot of attention to the dull ones but if something dramatic does happensay the chair muting a member then its all right there for them to make a stink about it people act better with eyes on them its simple human nature
i have posted elsewhere that there was someone not currently on the csm who i would vote for if he stood  this is that man  i have found myself agreeing with perhaps 90 of his posts over the course of csm 1 something i cant say of any other regular poster to the forums including the csm member i voted for last timeamong the 10 i dont agree with though is about the plan above for being able to claim low sec space without significant penalty for putting the smackdown on intruders wouldnt this make high sec carebears like me even less willing to make that step if they knew that a pirate wouldnt even get a slap on the wrist for blowing them away in my mind all that does is make low sec effectively nil sec  and if im not going low sec now i sure as heck wont go nil
thanks for the support much appreciatedmy goal with lowsec is to make it habitable by something other than the fraction of a percent of the population thats willing to play the game at 10 part of that is putting the riskreward curve in the right place but part of it is making it so that people can possibly play there without suffering the real hardship of 10 sec if theyre so willing i dont claim that it should be especially easy  i dont really know how hard it should be thats something that would need to be tested  but the idea of playercontrolled space in lowsec is a good one so far as i can tell it provides a stepping stone to 00 and it provides something for smaller combat corps that are bored of highsec to do if you want to avoid freegank lowsec under my plan use the factional warfare regions thats about half of lowsec and it wouldnt be actively controlled by players under my proposal a casual player looking to play a bit in lowsec can go to fw lowsec and nobody will be able to gank them without sec lossunless theyre in a fw corp of course  ie the status quo also your view of sec loss as a slap on the wrist only applies to some pirates because a lot of them regard their 10 as a point of pride i know one who used to refuse to ask for pod ransoms because that would deprive him of his 12 hit and make it take longer for him to get to 10 thats an extreme case of course but any serious lowsec pirate will not be fazed by a sec hit and a 15 minute timer its only the casual lowsec players who will be put off by it and my goal here is to make their lives easier
colonel xaven i have been thinking a lot how to describe my definition of fairness in a good way but failed  you can see some kind of definition in my reply to jinx fifth question to name you an example the efficiency and playability of a 20 million sp character depends heavily on what decisions he has made on his very first day when he has chosen his raceif you check the list of issues on the assembly hall you will find dozens of issues which are aimed for balancing of fairness in game and another dozen which are aimed for imbalance example boost my ship because i fly it if i was in csm i would definitely go for the issues which i feel are aimed for fairness looking at the list of issues during the first cycle issues such topics were  empire war dec mechanisms it is too easy and too cheap to grief imho wreck flagging for pvp why should a neutral be able to steal the loot in hisec if you gave your blood to obtain it alliance corps in factional warfare precision heavy missiles because they suck crane and nighthawk powergrid increase remote rep and aggression the logi ship is a great help in combat and it usually has a reliable escape through the gate why kill rights he ganked my unskilled alt stole my stuff i cant take revengei am also not very happy with the current income distribution inside eve there are cases when it is more rewarding to do some easy thing without risking much than doing something difficult in a dangerous environment
hi neresky i can ensure you i will try to do something to get ccp closer to the community i think the main problem is that ccp is doing an awful job communicating their decisions to the players they are a company they can make business decisions game time card changes and the ghost training issue are business decisions noone likes paying more and more for the same service so it is evident that there is a customer dissatisfaction in these cases however to make things even worse ccp tries to mask these business decisions as something else like adaptation of industry standards or fix of an old bug and people are outraged no wonder i wish they had consulted us about the ghost training issue because i think their improper explanation is more responsible for the drama than the actual plan to remove ghost training lacking ingame interaction with ccp is an interesting concept of yours i fully agree there is no ingame interaction between ccp and the players nowadays when think back to the early days of eve and i remember they had a dev chat time to time usually on coldfront it was out of game but at least it was interactive i wonder if something like that could be reinstated i am not so sure if it would work tho back in those days there were a lot less trolls than nowadays and i would be really sad if we managed to bring together a dev chat and some idiots would ruin it  anyways i am open for your suggestions how you think we could bring the devs and the community closer to each other as for the customer satisfaction part most of the existing issues the csm has forwarded to the ccp were to make customers happier there have been very unpopular steps from ccp which have caused major customer unhappiness but these were business decisions outside of csms jurisdiction the other problem csm is having is the lack of a metering tool to measure the actual customer satisfaction the only measurable input we are getting from the community right now is the amount of whining on the forum however i do not think that forum whining is a reliable way to measure the unhappiness of certain announced changes as the data we get from the forums is not a representative sample of the entire player base to help this situation csm needs new information gathering tools id favor if ccp developed these because they are the ones who can put these to the most accessible places in game but if they do not do it csm could develop its own tools as wellso well yes i have some ideas how to improve the communication from the players to ccp as for the other direction from ccp to the players well all we can do there is giving advices to ccp but it is not possible as long as csm only learns about the upcoming changes the same time the community does over the players news center
thanks for the reply tusko it was very well writteni also miss the days of dev chat and yes going by todays climate it will be difficult to control i also appreciate that change for the better is a long difficult road i miss the days when gms and devs jumped in ships and did of bit of role play  iremember a lot of the issues which stopped it from happening but surely with todays tighter control internal affairs it should be good fun and will result in the widening fissure between player and gmdev becoming less noticable  food for thought anywaythanks again tusko
im going to try and post some thoughts on a new topic regularly tonight after reading about yet another major theft i thought id talk a bit about corp theft and general member roles in a corporation im going to be up front and say my corporation has been victimized by corp thieves several times each time i learned how to make it less likely but i still think ccp could improve corp mechanics to make it even harder for a would be thiefso first i always wondered what it is about eve that brings out the worst in folks seems most everyone will gladly take anything that isnt nailed down in this verse if you give them half a chance and of course ccp has repeatedly stated that is a fully endorsed mechanic of life in the eve universe so basically as a ceo i am reduced to assume everyone is a crook that makes me a little sad but ive come to accept it currently the only folks with director roles in my corp are people i know personally and consider close friends and by friends i mean folks i can actually know in rl some other members have achieved a degree of trust that allows them some access to corporate assets but nothing like a director anymore so some would say big deal lock everything down and never trust and all is good problem is that means that i have to basically be available 237 to allow the corporation to function if i have to be away for a while keeping the corp functioning normally is very difficult so what would i change1 allow ceos to apply references to any member of the corporation when they leave maybe something as simple as one line of text and a number between 0 and 10 so i can make sure that a persons deeds god and bad follow them i currently follow folks that have done us wrong for some time after they left looking for when they change corps and then contact any new ceo they might have to provide some history2 corp theft seems like something that should affect your standings with say concord you know the police of eve so maybe that rating should contribute to a characters standing in some way just a thought3 as a ceo i should have a simple way to detect alts i know there are some methods today but i think this is something that should be clear to a ceo when they receive an application4 secure cans should be able to be locked down in a hangar by vote just like a bpo what good is a secure can if someone can just take the can out of the hangar right now there isnt a set of roles that lets us have an ore drop off can for each member that doesnt end up with some folks being able to take the whole can5 i want to be able to set up a can without a password that allows me to assign access to individuals and members with a special role now i can have a secure way to collect or distrubute things to my members before you say use contracts id say that would be extremely complicated for such an easy problem6 can audit logs should tell me when an unlocked thing is removed from the can now i can unlocks and locks but not the actual removal7 id like to be able to provide assets to members for a fixed period of time as loans they could use them but could not sell them reprocess them exchange them or destroy them they could be destroyed by normal means as part of regular use but not stolen these are just some of the things that as a ceo id like to see i am ok with corp theft in general after all as they say fool me once shame on you fool me twice i wont get fooled again id just like the dynamics of the actions of a corporate theft to make more sense actions should have consequences and as a ceo i think i should have a better set of tools to help my corp run smoothlyplease feel free to comment on this or suggest any other thing youd like a ramble ontill the next time fly safeissler
very interesting ideas i like the reference thingy but i think it could be abused personal conflicts etc but in general i think there are very good points you have
nope i would love to and my msn details are freely available in the intertubes but nobody else seems to use messengerinanna the meeting on sunday had been planned for a week it wasnt a day to day change that just happened as ankh rightfully pointed out we did agree that we would have a meeting every sunday
lets roll this back to the front so it can get lost among all the ghost training whines so much todo about something that should have been nixed years agocsms  do you even exist
anyone know if anything was said or done about it on sundays meeting
i say remove the torp bays and just make it a pure projectile boat 5 turret rof and 5 turret damage just like the tempest instead of the stupid split weapons system ala typhoon
i am voting in favor of bringing back ghost training
i might consider coming back only if they reverse this ridiculous moveif not thats 3 accountsthanks for the fun ccp while it lasted
yah hopefully all these people quit it will free up some of the lag d
yeah im loving all these tears
i guess some people are against that because the change will prevent many older gamers from some capital competition maybefor myself i canUFFFDt support this thread because the change gives more focus to characters ingame
go on and cry about it so you cant get sp without paying for it like me why should nonghost trainers expect to compete with players who have skills trained with game time they didnt pay foronly truetothecause freeloaders can be so upset about not getting something they dont workpay for
this is my vote against this issue i support ccps decision to eliminate ghost training
i was talking to a noob today and absolutely couldnt wait to tell him that because he was mostly training annoying short skills that hed be a slave to his fresh install of evemonnew player experiencefor the love of god youre killing the game with your shortsighted login demanding torture
op is born of win and post is filled with complete truthif i pay for your game i should definitely be able to play it in my own style if that includes sleep training a huge list of skills when i go overseas and cannot log in so be it ccp should be happy that i am paying for the game and they have profited from the relatively small stress my new play style puts on their serversthankssignedandre
although people have lived without skill queues it certainly has been a contributing factor towards people not wanting to play this gamei took a 5 month break from eve because i simply got sick of having to plan my life around my skill trainings that time is lost and i paid for itnow ccp goes and bans skill training from users who arent paying well if youre going to do that you should go the full mile and insure skill training for those who are paying anything less should cost you subscriberspeople dont play eve to manage their skill training they play to enjoy the game make it easier to fulfill that in reality and youll have a much happier fan baseso please ccp give us a skill training queue
i lost two months of paid training time because my computer harddisk died i approve of this
please make this a priority nw that ghost training is gone theres no reason ton say noes
hmm 150 pages on people complaining about ghost training but only 4 pages on this i guess alot of people dont read this part of the forums get around your alliance and corp m8s and get them to vote on this much needed feature and overdue feature
would be a very beneficial addition and as the original post stated the only reason not to have it in game is now gone so whats the problem ccp

a skill training queue is a much needed feature so long as the account is paid for i see no reason not to implement this feature

perhaps they have a life and you dontskillmanagment has nothing to do with gameplay for christ sake what the hell makes it fun to have to micromanage your time around bloody skilltrainingswitch times this has zero to do with playerskill or management skill  people with 24h computeraccess andor no life have an advantage over normal people period

i do not understand why people think that a naglfar is worse off than a phoenix seriously phoenix can only use citadel torps at least a nag can use some turrets
yep i fully agree with this i think we need some better guidelines for where to past what and when
well yes if the moderation was being done topics presented by the csm or brought by the players and later endorsed by a csm should get a stickyi was going more towards the other extreme just for the sheer fact that there isnt the moderation and something needs to be done to stifle the filth and growing amount of spam ideas just because someone used heyiamimportantbracketseither way something needs to be done
my opinion on this matter ideas or issues without a previous discussion should not be put up to vote vote and discussion threads should be crosslinked to each other discussions should only happen on threads dedicated to this in the appropriate subforums ie ship tweaking goes to ships and modules csm issues go to the jita corner etc threads on the assembly hall should only be used for voting a dev needs to be assigned to the csm that does enforce the posting rules only csm members should report unfitting threads in the assembly hallthis would at least create more focus on the voting aspect of the assembly hall and the democratic process represented by that it would eliminate all the bad ideas and stuff no one cares about out of the assembly hall and puts the discussion of issues into the places where people caring for them are frequently looking around a bit more focus and coordination would do the csm a big favour

smartbomb  a weapon so dumb they had to invent bombs to make it look smart
or you can go to control panelnetwork connections right click your network connection and hit disable i need clarification in the op do you mean that the aggro timer after logoff with aggression should be increased to 1718 minutes or do you mean if someone is aggrod post logging that the person that gained aggro should be given sufficient time to kill the target if enough firepower is on grid within 2 minutes of post log off aggro
adapting is key in eve i have done so many times nanoers will too
would be great to have this back if it were possible
yes please bring it back
no dont
capt heres my opinion yes this would be kind of nice but also many people mine with multiple clients for example i run the hauler and two hulks at the same time if some ass keeps warping into the belt challenging all my clients over and over well thats about the time i get the smartbombing domis out for the little bastard but i do think that you are on to something the problem is this mechanic would quickly be abused people who are sitting at war target gatecamps i know im not always at the keyboard i go make a drink or get something to eat and come back to some challenege window and my wreck because i wasnt the 237 gamer i should have been but yes i think you have a good idea but it would be very difficult to implement while allowing safe guards for people who are eating a sandwich or posting on the forums or watching a tv show while mining
glad to hear a miners point of view thanks for the inputthere has to be someway to stop the macro miners and creat some fun for real players at the same time thanks all i have to go away from the internet for awhile cause of work will be back in a month and hopefully see some ideastheres gotta be a way without hurting the real minersdont wanna do that at all
not going to pretend to know the answer but i would really like to see something done also
like the ideas on your site bunyip i wish there was a simple way to simply flag all macro miners as hostile  i know impossible to do but it would be great to implement would mean you could shoot on site penaltyless
time for one more then iam offfor you miners out there how long would be a reasonable time to acknowledge a challenge
mcfly youre in a player corp folks shouldnt bother you unless your behavior indicates youve gone afk for a protracted period and your mining has not stopped a convo attempt for example if theyre really narfed at you they can always declare on your allianceits the npc corps that need to be fixed disallowing the use of advanced mining ships above cruiser period end of story and banning the use of freighters skill cant even be trained in nuubschool corps trained but not used in fallback npc corpsexposed the macros to wardecs prevent them from corp jumping all day long to avoid wars and the macro situation will be fixed
that will not stop macro mining just makes it harder
well this has clinked it bunyip is out for my vote another one for the harass the miners camp when mining i am not bolted to my chair it is useful to be capable of doing some house chores without problems and my hulk can easily mine for 25 minutes without supervision if you think that people should live before the screen it is your problem editjust to explain it better the op feel all miners should be punished indiscriminately because some people exploit that part of the game and giving any tool in the hand of the players to do that will insure it will be indiscriminate similarly bunyip idea of roving npc fleets to destroy miners is not better it will punish people for some minute of absence it is pretty evident that there is a group of people that cant think that someone can find mining something worth doing and so bunch all people doing that as macrominers but i see no reason to vote one of them to the csm
a few months back i saw an ambulation video where ccp mentioned that some of the ambulation avatars will look like they belong to specific bloodlines meaning that if those avatars can only be used by those bloodlines then our appearance options in ambulation will be limited by a choice we made before we could of known that it would limit us beyond the portraitat the very least we will be limited by our characters current gender and i dont really want to be staring at a guys rear while im walking in stationsso what i propose is that when ccp brings us ambulation all existing characters get to chose from all possible avatar optionsi dont care if this will effect my portrait or not and i dont care if my first avatar selection will limit later selections as long as we are informed of this beforehandedit just to clarify i am happy with my current portrait and if i wasnt i still chose it i am not happy with it limiting my choice of avatar for ambulation when we still do not know what form that limitation will takeedit 2 in this thread when i say portrait i am referring to our current character appearance when i say avatar i am referring to the appearance of our character when we leave our ships and walk around in stationsand for those of you who are saying this because you find achuras ugly please prove that your avatar options will be better than mine
that would suck you picked a name a gender and a look when you well knew that it would be your ingame appearance people know you by that name gender and looki must say that i would be quite dissapointed if it was like you wish for it to bethe most i can think of would be to allow minor changes to the existing avatar especially if it is in line with additional options
yes back when i thought it would only be a small icon that i wouldnt have to see that often so i didnt care too muchthen ccp announced ambulation meaning if i want to make use of it i will have to look at my characterso tell me how many people you know by the look of their avatar when they are walking around in stationnow tell me how you will feel if when ambulation comes out you find that the only avatars you can make are ugly while people who chose a different gender andor bloodline can avatars that look much better
sell your current char with iskies buy another female andor attractive character one of equal value with iskiesproblem solved
thats the joyfully horrible thing with eve your decisions actually haunts you forever
you picked a bloodline and now you are stuck to it why should an avatar be any different from any other action you make in eve sorry
what if people didnt pay for multiple accounts and spend years skilling up in order to reach some kind of plateau in personal advancement well then ccp might actually have to make some content for their game rather than just a sandbox and thats never going to happen ccp likes stringing you out for years on multiple subscriptions while giving you free expansions that are only 39mb big and a game thats only 3 gigs on the hard drive after over half a decade thats just too little work for too much money for them to change anything can you say it any better
as cool as it would be to train out my main and a alt miner nub it wont work and frankly id rather not have this game turn out and be a huge chinese farmer market p
to stay inline with other mmos where you play only one character at the time id introduce diminishing returns to this suggestion one character would train at full speed two characters each train at halved speed and three character each at one third the speed other than that this has my full support
i also support the idea with a diminishing returns caveat however i would like to see it set up as a pool system with a percentage of skill points being able to be set by players on all 3 characters based on player preference if you choose to spend 100 of your skill points on one character and nothing for your alts fine if you want to split your training 333333 or 60400 or any other combination that equals out to 100 thats good too what i do not support is an increase to the overall pool of skill points
prevents scams for ipo activity of sound business plans by taking the money back forcibly execution of repayment can happen at any time after a set date and only requires that there be isk in the account only avoidable if barrower never again has isk in their wallet thus hard to scam with old main characters who are known to make moneyoptionsisk ammountrepayment enforcement dateinterest ratebondloan type selection and related settingsrepayment enforcement date is just the date at which the lender can click collect on the contract and the money will be drafted as available from the account of the barrower if theres only a partial amount available its drafted as much as available if the money is available in the form of escrow or other liquid form trade orders are canceled and the isk is recovered collection can be performed multiple times until the full amount is recoveredfor a bond type agreement the contract will automatically withdraw the appropriate interest rate percentage from their account each dayweekmonthfor a loan type agreement the rate compounds and no drafts are made but repayment in part is availablebut you can still scamyes but only by never again having isk in the wallet of that character which is hugely inconvenient for a main character this loan device is only for when you know damned well that the character is going to make the money back at some point and you just want to be sure that when they get it you get yoursfor example i am a successful trader and would like to raise some capital im good for it because im rich and a skilled trader however this device would let a lender hold me to my word under the assumption that i make money which is true so instead of me for sure getting rich and keeping the capital i for sure get rich and have to whether i choose to or not give the capital backthis instrument would be perfect for allowing ipo activities on trustworthy characters to be less sensitive to souring relationships while methods of scam exist they are inconvenient to the scammer and require dumping the character or never again using that characters wallet
hm i think this is interestinghowever it does open up for a new type of scam where people borrow money transfer the isk to their man and deletes the character this might be against the eula but it wont prevent it from happening and most people wouldnt know that its against the eulaits kinda a can of worms im really not sure what to think of it some discussion on it would be nice
realworld loans are not enforced by the laws of nature theyre enforced by the laws of man if you keep refusing to pay back a loan eventually somebody will shoot you the system is exactly the same in eve except that the guy shoots a lot sooner and doesnt have nearly as nice of a uniform when he does it i dont see a reason why this needs to change  police your own loans
it doesnt work like that neither in the real world nor in evein real life you dont have to be a powerful mercenary corporation in order to give out loans police lawyers and courts help you enforce your rights if the debitor doesnt pay getting shot in the process is a rather small riskthe problem in eve is that there are many situations where loan enforcement is simply not possible the debitor joining any sizable corp is often enough for that matter not joining any tooit would be good if there was some support gameside for loans maybe not like suggested by the op but it is still the right direction if it was tied to a drawback taxed for example it would still be a viable options to work outside such a system and take the risk for additional profit
its not as simple as just making a new contract type with enforcing rules behind itwith all the legal hrmf character trading going on there would need to be a way to see if a character was in debt as well  or it would become extremely risky ever buying a char again hmmm maybe not a bad idea after all point being even without this complication and im sure theres others its way too easy to abuseeven a main char could let one of his alts handle all his isk  or a 2nd main on anohter account or corp wallet orinconvinient perhaps but for some quite alot im sure it would be worth it to scam x billions of iskapart from that not sure if you know or not as you make no mention of it there already exists several player made banks in eve doing loans yes you need to put up collateral but that truly is the only scam free way which actually works quite welli should know as i run the first one ever made ill spare you the plug though as this isnt the place
all methods of scam proposed revolve around either never using that characters wallet again or ditching the characteras for verification that the character isnt in debt look at contract history and search for any loanswith regard to the neverusingmywalletagain scam for people who train up alts buy characters and open second accounts specifically to get more tradings slots and clones losing a wallet is equivalent to losing the character not to mention that this scam is only good once per character eliminating it as a method of operation for the main of a scammersame rules that holds for all other agreements will protect one from the majority of scams dont trust people you dont at least think you know dont trust new characters or likely altsas for player corp avoidance using a player corp wallet just make the drafts withdraw from any wallets that the player has access to this would theoretically allow a debt to be collected from a corp with a debtor who has access to the wallet but if the debtor were going to scam the corp in the first place all they need is access to the corp wallet and forget about the loan contractthis contract isnt designed to protect from all scams but rather the minor scams that happen as a result of failure to repay the character still exists and has lots of money but they arent repaying it in the event of a broken relationship you have the authority over the debtors wallet and thats much more capability to gain recourse than currently existsby herschels argument we might as well have market orders requiring enforcement of the delivery of isk and items market is a basic unit of enforcement that ensures goods and currency delivery in a mutual and reliable fashion this contract would add weak enforcement to casual agreements where there currently is none ask yourself how much trade would happen without the market then ask yourself how much the viability of lending would improve with a simple contract that follows the debtor wherever they gotldrsupport
i need cash loans against my liquid equity i cant put up collateral in this case because my collateral is liquid equity that im using for tradingmy balance sheet is always going to be positive and associated risk is very low only risk is that i make all the isk i intend to using the loan and then never pay it offwhat this contract would allow is instead of using nonliquid equity to back a loan use liquid equity as an additional source of capital my wallet is my collateral
would be risky just like banking is
eve enforcement is fairly simple  there is enforcement in the present tense there is no enforcement in the future tense i see no reason to break that model especially when said break wouldnt really do what you want it to do
well apparantly they explained themselves here which is a start
eve has always been expensive ccp has also stated that its intentional as eve is a special game its not wow its simple economics if those 5 usd matters to you that how could you even afford a computer leave alone the power to run it i dont trust you
communication could indeed be better its one of the classic problems of the growing company my advice fix it now rather than later and dont be afraid to hire a training company for this from personal experience good internal and external communication makes a job far more enjoyable and profitable
epic comparing eve and wowi like how you use the royal we in your postccp suffer player backlash on almost all of their decisions to change ingame and outofgame features this is due to the fact that players are affected by the decisions and have a shorterterm vision and much narrower focus than ccp its a companythat exists to make money and what a great way to make it i doubt if they make decisions such as ghosttraining lightlyplayers should consider some serious rl issues that ccp facesicelandic banks are in a very poor statepresumably ccp has icelandic bank accounts so will be affected to a degreethe world is entering a global recession especially icelandcompanies need to take steps to ensure they survive such upheavalif ccp didnt take steps to remain viable we wouldnt be havent this discussionyou wouldnt have eve to play anymorepart of my platform for election to the csm is the communication from ccp however communication is a twoway street publicly bashing and lambasting a company and then expecting better communication isnt usually a fruitful path imo i think they communicate well recent dev blogs and liveblogs been excellent although a little more notice sometimes could be good noting that none of us know reasons for such decisions apart from ccps explanationsyou state that ccp dont take communication very seriously and lie strong accusations can we have some definite proof pleaseeven more worrying is you post negatively about ccp then want constructive repliestake carearithron
perhaps you should read the context of what you quoted and to what it was a replyfunny that ccp told us directly that theyre not affected by the crisis and are currently one of the companies that does well
id suggest the solution isccp to use the csm or a group of players as a sounding board for this kind of bigchange communicationthen they can get the perspective of the players reactions before making an epic error in communication call it a quality check if you likeill support a solution based issue but not a whine at large more ideas please on how to qa this kind of communication and change
imo having run 35 accounts for the last four years ive never done any of this ghost training even for my carrier pilot i have no idea why they would have allowed it at all or allowed it to continue for so long removal of it is a needed fix to work around the exploit if you will of having a character training or garnering rp ect without paying for the accountno pay  no progress its that simple if you want to progress for free there are other games out there
the removal of the 30 d cards have everything to do with it when the price shifted for the cards the supply dropped big time lower supply but maintain the same demand and prices go up if they were to match the price of the cards to actually cost the same as a 60 day credit subscription or restore the 30 day cards then supply would go back up and prices would stabilize
i would say ccp should just allow trading game time for isk for a fixed price lets say 500meveryone who wants to sell knows what he will get everyone who wants to buy knows what he has to pay dont allow wtb threads anymore as they will just get bumped and bumped all day because otherwise they are away from page one within half an hour max so just wts threads 500m fixed price and we are all cool well at least i would like it that way
i vote no on this one
does that mean that all those who set the long skill  while it was possible  and then went on deployment lost their job went on vacation insert whatever reason here are dishonest or are you just playing at agent provocateur
support
thats you putting a spin on my words the key word here is payingand it doesnt have jack to do with people using the featurebug unintentionally its the ones stringing up character training time with inactive accounts that i despise they dont contribute ingame since theyre not online theyre just a waste of database as far as im concerned
im pretty sure that most people who ghost skill have more than one account and also buy the shorter subs which cost more and are therefore among the highest paying group of playersthe object of the exercise is to net ccp as much cash as possible to get them through the credit crunch and i fail to see how enraging players and destroying the incentive to open extra accounts will helpthe most hurtful thing is the lies though  csms please stop towing the party line on this and give us some truth
we were all honest decent paying customers the difference is that we applied the mechanics in a way which coincided with the policies when we allowed our accounts to lapse  mechanics which were previously in the player guide and provided us incentive to return every so often
no  no pay no play seems fairly straightforward concept to methose that used this in the past should be thankful it was there consider themselves fortunate and get on with it
it doesnt surprise me ccp did that with lockin threahds in the csm forum that may threaghten ccp tbh if it was up to me id fire the ccp that locked it for the simple fact this is csm forum part only so  of ccp onli read dnt friggin remov anythinlock
they were not intended mechanics this was a bug which was being exploited by a tiny fraction of the population of eve 46 originally if i read correctly however this began to get out of control they took notice and fixed the bug its a bug no rights are being infringed the cheat you were exploiting has been fixed learn to adapt why this keeps popping up in assembly hall mystifies me
ankh im not getting at you here i voted for you and will again if you run this is about the position any communicator between ccp and the customers must be inthis threadcsm meeting threadthe cccp politburo must be holding the reigns very tight to make ccp wrangler the csms and every employee of ccp lie through their teeth just what kind of stick are these people holding over you that you feel compelled to lie for them it is often observed that a committee is the best way to solve a problem because people use all their energy organizing and ranting which leaves the real power brokers free to do as they please then when the cod hits the propeller the committee has to take all the flak and i cant help feeling that this is where the csms are right nowwhats so magic about the number 7 stop tying yourself up in democratic knots i cant believe that a group of people with decent iq and computer skills can still be relying on everybody turning up at a specific time and virtual place irrespective of rl commitments a private forum weekly vote and nominated spokesperson could be a basic suggestion though i suspect you folks have more experience than me in these things so whyerrthe above quotethe stupid thing is that ccp are presumably trying to act in the best long term interests of eve and they have one of the best customer communication tools ever in the csm council yet they are using it like an armour repper instead of a tech iii information launcherplease please please can the csm council sort themselves out you are not paid by ccp so do not have to tow the party line so please have no fear in confronting the bull i suspect that behind the ghost training decision lies some clever business decision like homogenizing the eurousa server with the china one attracting rl retailers into the stations with ambulation or adding some sims style element to attract more female players but without strong csms who can bypass ccps godawful pr the ccp honchos will keep shooting their feet to the detriment of all of us who love this game
theres already an issue for this and ive already raised it for discussion at the next meeting ankhs proposal appears to suggest the need for a skill queue which i am not sure should be bundled and i dont believe i can support as i dont believe the two to be related and skill queues have already been discussed should ankh unbundle that ill be happy to remove the need to discuss the similar proposal ive addedi do however support rolling back the ghost training removal
i was tring to keep it generic rather then go into specifics of which ships and which roles as that opens up the flood gate of pimp my chosen ship or class type argumentsthere are many disscussions of ships that just dont past must in thier class or the role their class is suppose to fillover in the ships and fitting forum you can find various disscussions on themwhere i was going is simply making every ship viable in its class and in the role of its class a pass over all the ships and which ones are used most and which are never flown would be good starting areaswith some of the changes coming that are currently on sisi we might see a more solid return to some roles for various ships so that is helping but in the same vein the usefulness of other ships might cease or trend downwardevery ship should have a role and a purpose to fill in the game and be able to fill that role as good as any other ship that also has that role again i am tring to keep it generic so as not to spawn arguments over the various types classes or roles in game data can speak far clearer on this then the player base and even the devs can
this should be something that balance teams are always looking at and i would like at least one example for this statementif the statement is false then that just means that ccp is already following this suggestion
ok some i can think of off the top of my headharpyenyodeimosmunnin maledictionraptorthere are others go down the ship list and think when was the last time you saw this or that ship out there i dont claim to have been everywhere all the time so some of these ships might be a little more popular in some areas of space that i dont frequent but these are also some that are complained about joked about ect in the ships and modules forums as well as in game in various chat channelsagain i dont want this devovling into a debate over what ships are better then others that is for the ships and modules forumthe data on what ships are flown and how often should be readily avaliable to the devs to look and see what ships are not being made sold flown destroyed ect this would give the clearest picture
all assault frigs need a major examination of their rolescurrently interceptors trump them which makes no sense small fragile ships with insande dps for their size taranis claw ect makes the slower tougher assault frig pointlessshift interception to interceptors  increase their tackling performance claw  good stiletto  excellent but remove their damage bonuses for other catch em and pin em down bonuses shift the dps bonus to the assalt frigsand flipflop the weapon bonuses on the wolfjag  their current iterration is just idioticimo all other ships seem to fit the role that they were intended for with some tweaks needed to the sensor damp ships to bring them in line with their other ew counterparts
people have suggested a speed cap per hull already let me suggest that again with a twist speed cap is a function of the hulls mass modules that affect mass increase the speed cap but do not affect speed modules that affect speed buff the speed of the ship by a percentage to maximum for the hull percentage to maximum is a common mechanic in eve so this should fit in well since the amount of modules that affect a ships mass is small nanos and polies then its easy to control how fast a particular hull could getkeep the web and mwd changes as is those are great its the changes to ship performance that are overly drastic
right most are using mercury instead of lead somehow its easier that wayi dont like the idea either but i think it would be possible actually  the minerals we know cannot be elements they have to be made up of the elements we know and perhaps a few we dontanyway that wouldnt do the game any good
brown dealer  ok u guyz its time fo a reel game alchemy online lol horrible idea thumbs down
squirrrel i agree with you about your point for 3 or 4 level and lets say skills below x8but i cant understand this but why cant you get accelerated learning through actually flying a ship whilst it trains sry english isnt my native sometimes its hard for me to catch ones point and exact meaning as authormy point wasyes we can fly ships and do something but im sure you know as much as i do that eve starts its standby modeuntil abilities will much comfortable levels at some point of playing which leads to frustrating dull boring waiting even while repeating some activities  and rising those activities boredom until you try all activities of chain of what you can do with your current skills within acceptable time and finally get yourself to the point where you left stuck with some skill and had it with all activities you can do old skill training had a feature when you cud get away on vacation from eve while character rise his skill then return and try new activity paying for play time some people say it was unfair and all but i ask myself if its fair now to cut noobes out of that feature witch lasted for 5 years to date or is it fair to pay for skill training only account maybe for reused price of full price of subscription yeah lolthat puts eve to one shelf with other mmos click we are in average mmo haha not funny at allim sure that some payers can play eve in skill waiting mode but not for longfrom all people i tried to lure to eve only 2 stayed noobes are scared of amounts of time they need to wait for skillsfew guys from my corp who are around from 2004 got to long skills and took of to rl they got boredi dont think ccp will make some adv advanced learnings and nether they will remake skills calculation so one exit out of the grinding trap that i see is more implantsit is not my style of playing to wait for something forever hope to find support from people who think same
i agree with this the removal of ghost training does not change anything that would call for 5 and higher implants it would only benefit the elite who can afford to pay for a subscription anyways
the question is if you let this go what you will be forced to let go next nerf
while i think its possible that at this point ccp has put enough work into trying to balance their rebalance that they will ignore any disagreements with their changes i dont care bump

work in progressthere are several open issues which frustrate me the fact that ccp has not yet given us the 30 day gtc back is itching in the back of my mind as well as the fact that despite popular demand we still have not gotten a skillqueue of course ill try to ask about these things at fanfest but if that fails you can expect to see this on agenda again next termi was also disappointed in the rejection of the exploration ship issue the csm dismissed this as lazyness but i think this was just lazyness from their end that they did not want to look closely at the specific exploration playstylewith quantum rise coming up id like to get on top of science  industry and make sure that the features requested by players make it into this expansion i want to see an interface overhaul with jobs being easier to set up and maintain especially if multiple jobs are managed at once science  industry should also be properly integrated into the corporation interface with proper access privilegesfactional warfare still needs a lot of work to be the shining gem it should be i want to make sure skilled players get the rewards they deserve so that factional warfare can actually earn you a living like it should instead of only being an isk sink currently kills do not earn players anything and there is no point to capturing systems something should be done theremissions are also an ungoing project since ccp will make announcements at fanfest regarding missions ill wait for that but i want to make sure missions are not the static boring predictable prescripted content they are nowfor 00 i want to see objectives for small roaming gangs that can be completed in a relatively short timeframe current pos warfare is too static and does not encourage much tactical insight  just bring the largest fleet and you win mobility should be an option too so smart players can set up diversions and then strike at weak spots  and earn some nice rewards in the processfinally i still want to push for more playerdriven justice both in lowsec as in the other areas of space ccp will look at bounty hunting now and the moment they start working on something i would like the csm and players to get involved and give feedback asapgetting in touchduring the last term i got some effective communication with the players running through the take care platform we had discussions and focus groups but i would like to improve on this both by making it more transparent as well as increasing on frequency your say in things should not end after you have cast your vote and i encourage you to get in touch or apply for a place in the take care structure

concord provides consequences not protection  the balance is pretty good at the moment especially now with higher security status hits if players are rich enough that they become targets then they should be thinking about 00 and seperating them from their assets probably helps them because they end up with less to loseallowing wardecs against individuals even when in npc corps is something i think needs considering as a point of principle but practically its not important currently alongside other issuesi consider the existence of session change timers the oldest bug that should be fixed its true removing them challenges eves core architecture but they arent fundamentally impossible to remove they were not intended and their enforcement is clientside which goes against ccps policy of the client being a dumbterminal where no advantage can be gained by modding it weve all lost pods due to not being able to jump or dock following a ship loss and other similar session change conditions recently a mothership theft was perpetrated as a result of a session change timer on joining gang while i havenothing against the very harshest of thefts being possible in eve i do feel uncomfortable when unpredictable technicalities have such a huge effect on eve younger less experienced players are hurt by a learning curve that is more treacherous than it needs to beships remaining in space long after the pvp timer has ended following logoff when lag is bad is a very old critical bugnot being able to warp to gang members randomly is common and oldcollision detection seems to be fundamentally flawed lag affects bumping and always has colliding capital ships cause desyncs and ccp acknowleged in their first devblog on speed nerfs 
id like to wish you luck and echo some of the issues you raise  first having served on the student senate in college as well as on a few different committees since then i would like to reiterate that the importance of having good rules of order cannot be understated this is one of the most important things to making meetings more efficienti also agree very much that lowsec needs work especially that it needs to be more profitable to industrialists i find your idea of allowing groups to establish control of lowsec and take no security penalty for defending it is quite interesting however i do have a few questions regarding itfirst you only mention corporations would alliances under your proposal be able to claim lowsec in this way what about multiple corporations not in an alliance claiming systems together how many systems would a single corporation be able to claim do you see this as primarily a tool for industrialists to more easily defend against pirates not all of whom might be below 5 security status a tool for industrialist pirates to achieve exclusive economic exploitation of a system or a tool for pirates to gank people for free as you may have guessed this is a topic very near and dear to my heart and i hope we have the chance to work on it together in the csm
well ive often disagreed with you and certainly had plenty of criticism from your lips herschel  but ultimately i do respect your decision to try to make improvements to the csm and im glad youve decided to run good luck
good to hear others are of like mind on this one  its one promise ill be looking to complete as fast as possible i have no objection to alliances being allowed to claim space since theres a lot of alliances that exist either for vanity or to allow better organization of a group of players not all alliances are bobswarm the exact mechanics of it could be annoying to figure out the details on due to the differences in code between corps and alliances but im for it in principle a single corporation can take as much space as they want the limit should not be an artificial rule on how much space you can take it should be incentivebased  if youre powerful enough to take 100 systems of lowsec youre likely powerful enough to take 30 systems of 00 and the system should be set up such that you make more money from the latter would you rather shoot battlecruiser rats 710 complexes and mine gneiss at the best of times or would you rather shoot battleshipand officer rats 1010 complexes and mine arkonor this is what i mean when i talk about a proper riskreward scheme  players should be funneled into the level most appropriate for them by going for the best payout they can achieve instead of giving big boys a reason to play in the sandbox or giving 00 over to minor corps because nobody else wants it as for what i see it as a tool for all of your options sound good the group that comes to mind first is smaller corps looking to have a role in organized pvp without the fleet power to make it in 00 but pirates industrialists and roleplayersone group you dont mention  i imagine someone like cva would gladly take on the role of being a formal police presence for their factions lowsec should all be encouraged to have fun with it as well i dont like farreaching changes to the game that only benefit one group and so id like to see it work for everyone who wants to make a go of it thanks
tusko has done an excellent job as an alternate  then replacement full delegate on the inaugural csm  and i definitely think he deserves a chance to serve again hes an important voice for small unit pvp on the council and thats a direction we should definitely be encouraging
replacement full delegate who left
hardin has resigned from his position on the 6th october as first alternate i took his office for the time remaining
ah okay what happened with hardin
hardin is healthy as regards his reasons for leaving id leave that for him to express if he felt he should
my bounty hunters got him jokes apart he is fine his reasons for resigning were unrelated to eve
thats good to hear at least also tusko you might want to change your signature  youre not actually first alternate anymore
oz has been an excellent csm alternate since we asked him to step up and replace some inactive but higher placed alternates and the csm and ccp have been lucky to have him he deserves to get voted into office as one of the main nine delegates this time for his work and good positive outlook towards eve
issler dainze  csm candidate  let me be your voice when you scream in spaceso tonight i thought id share some thoughts about the relevancy of the csm does it matter can it make a differenceso i suppose you could take a number of positions regarding the value of the csm one might be that it is some sort of waste of time to allow ccp to go off and do something totally random and not aligned with the population of eve my inner conspiracy nut and baser pesimistic voices love this argument my irrational side also likes to think a company like ccp would believe in their hearts that ignoring and tormenting their customers leads to glory 1 collect underpants2 torment customers3 4 profitsthankfully medication and regular exersise keep these inner voices at bay i think down that road madness liesso another position might be best intentions but doomed to failure all sorts of factors could result in the csm have no positive effect on eve ideas could be impractical csm candidates could have agendas that favor their base the csm could fall into chaos and never finds a unified voice ccp could find no practical way to integrate the input from the csm into their product plans it is very complicated to create a piece of software like eve all these are possible i worry about these possibilities and more if i should be elected i would constantly consider these and other factors that could negate any real value the csm might havefinally there is the possibility that led me to run that the csm could come together find a structure and process that result in some great possible improvements to eve that they work with ccp in a manner that gives their suggestions credibility and are practical to implement that demonstrates to ccp that the csm will produce improvements that are widely accepted as positive i think this is possible i think i bring a skill set and perspective that will help bring this aboutso i ask everyone to consider this is it worth it to try and support the concept of the csm to try for the positive outcome i hope if you all think about it you will decide it is i believe that a functional csm can be the voice of the pod pilots of eve in a way that other alternatives cannot provide i hope youll support all of us that have offered to try and make this happeni have one other request hold the csm accountable follow their actions provide your feedback in the forums and other channels if the csm is not profesional in their conduct is biased in their actions are unresponsive to your input then make it known that you wont accept them as your representatives raise your voices in the forums rise up and make your grievenance clear stand up for your rightsin the end the csm belongs to the pilots of eve i think you could even say eve belongs to the pilots of eve we all have the power to shape eve if we choose to accept it lets make sure the csm helps the pilots of eve create the future we want i the csm can but not alone we can suceed together or fail aloneissler dainzecsm candidateceo tadakastu obata corporationfounder of the honda accordstuffs getting better stuffs getting better every day

i was very impressed with some of his work as a standin alternate on the first csm  and i think hed make a good diligent and openminded member of the 2nd csm very much an everyman candidate and not beholden to any alliance pressure group one to watch
ive known arithron for some time now hes very level headed and highly competent in his knowledge of both eve itself and its players and thier views on a wide range of issueshis play is heavily focused on industry but knows a fair bit about pvp aswell even as a pvper rather than an industrialist myself i still feel that in all fairness arithron is a model player and member of the community and hence would be an excellent candidate for election into the csmsignedrocket
i have 5 year experience in the game and well aware fo the problems that can easily be fixed if only i had their ear everything from poss and combatthrough these doors you will learn the art of total submission you will learn how to trust in complete selflessness together we will explore who you are and test your limits discover your desires and  finally  restore balance to your life
whats your stance on the forum softwares automatic censorship of obscenities
we have email evemail and ingame channel mod ontop of that half the csm probably have each others phone numbers from the june meet short of implants that should be more than sufficientnot by my understanding we changed to meet every 14 days as we covered the majority of issues and the others coming through could be batched to biweekly after discussion on the csm only forum beforehand to make it a decision based meeting rather than discussion
well it looks like now is the timekaiden
a vote for me is a vote for respect for everyone
voting for me is just a good idea i could say its about ingame bugs or fresh new missions i would rather see what eve looks like out the window of my ship than the window of a star base in a nut shell i am for those who have an investment of real money and time in eve because you guys set an example that eve is here to stay eve is my game i take this game seriouseveryone lets work together or apart to keep eve the at the front of the line in in gaming satisfaction thank you and fly safe
hiim some nondescript rare poster of the eveonline forums who has been playing the game continuously for a little over a year now i tried eve in late 2005 when i discovered that wow really sucked but i was looking for something to do i was shocked id never heard of eve and gave it a try i was unable to find my niche at the time and quit playing in early 2006 i tried it again late 2006 but again didnt like mission running over and over and really had no mentor or friends to play with so i quit againa year later i discovered my current corporation merch industrial merch industrial is a member of the evil goonswarm that is cool to hate right now as i understand my primary focus of play has been both pvp and industrial currently im in a pure industrial phase which consist of 00 mining ice  ore use of exhumerrorqual ships ore  ice compression pos logistics and is my primary source of incomei am a macintosh client user primarily i run up to three clients right now on a single mac pro across two displays for mining operations with three accounts zareph is my main but i have two others that are part of merch industrial that i use as pure miningrorqual altsi am upset about the ghost training nerf i think it could have been handled better and maybe accounts created before a certain date should have left the ability to continue to do it or other feautres should have been implemented simultaneously to address why ghost training was so vital there are several skills out there that i feel are a ridiculous waste of my life to wait on and paying to sit there and do nothing on skills that are required to do anything cool is not how i like to play a gameim ambivalent about the speed changes on one hand i can see the need for some on the other hand i think someone took the nerf off the bat and beat the poor guys senselessi feel 00 is the redheaded stepchild of eve and that there are some good ideas for change and some crazy ideas for change i dont like and i have posted some of my thoughts personally but i would expect support from the community and have no set agenda i want to pushim excited to hear an orca is coming i had raised an issue as an individual as a assembly hall and seemed to get some good support around it so who knows if they were doing it anyway or that had anything to do with it
im sure there were many productive discussions on the matter have we mentioned that ccp are adding certificates and medals to the game
the emo rage quit tears are very flowing in this pointless thread but they taste so good1 ccp says they are going to fix lag issue2 ccp removes ghost training3 cheap players quit4 rest of eve players who pay to play get better frame ratesniiiiiiiiiiice
wait a sec youre saying that because of ghost training ccp decided to make some skills a month long and have them as requirement for new shipsi tried a half dozen replies but i think this fits best into this forum and sums it up just as wellwtf
i pay 3 account with real money so explain me why you are not paying for something you use is like my monthly fee will cover your skill training on ghost mode and that is not fair i am not a fun of ccp but they need money to keep everything running btw you guys complaining about stop of gost training are you working for free in rlwhy ccp employers do that
good job with ending of ghost training i think ccp will lose more money if they reactivate ghost training first of all players that use frequently this feature have multiple account and use them alternatively this mean that pay in total for one account and train skills on 2 accounts ans this is an unfair advantage over the regular players second if ghost training will be reactivates will look like ccp agree with that and will encourage players to use it and this means that more and more players will use ghost training and ccp will get less moneygood job ccp
hooray ccpnot sarcastic

id vote for a skill queue of 1 so you could have you short skill plus a long one to fall back to would certainly help when downtime gets unexpectedly extendedid also vote for concurrent training on character slotsthat said im glad ghost training has gone as im not in favour of the idea training a character without playing it which to me ghost training represents or the idea of it being used as a means to just train characters to sell though there may be the issue that concurrent training could result in the same issues

nice to see that ccp are looking after their vet players who have played and payed loally for years by making sure the newest and most advanced ships are ballenced correctly  with constant detailed updatesoh waitnvm
i cant say anything that hasnt already been said  but this idea does not have my supportfail idea is fail
why dont you just nerf eve

signed for skill queuing
i would also like a definitive yes on this issuemy preference is skill queueing over dual training because the first skill might affect the second skill eg learning skills and prerequisites
as in when are we going to get our medium  large subcapital tractor beamsmedium 40km 750mslarge 80km 1000mshello is anyone there
medium is a small on a marauder large is a small on an orca there is no need for the actual items to be added to the game whether they exist in the database or not
yes votefor a time the eve theme was interesting but i enjoy life exceedingly and wish to savor the game for its spaceships and other aspects of coolness as well as to savor it for being a fun game not the dark and forboding universe of passiveaggressives like often made out to be in the promotional materialcoolness requires no suspension of disbelief be a believer in coolness today
change is unlikely because decent ideas have been aired before and have had zero resultthe main issue is people logging after jumpingundocking into other people solve that and youUFFFDll have solved at least 90 of the abuse of the logoff mechanicshow simple add a 5 minute cloak when someone disconnects within two minutes after a initiating a session change when the cloak runs out player is handled as being on the pvp timer of 15 minutes and as usual tries to emergency warp if you logged off youUFFFDll die if you ctdUFFFDd and got back on in time youUFFFDve got the fair chance you should have if you ctdUFFFDd and didnt get back on in time you stand the same chance you would have if you didnUFFFDt ctd none if thereUFFFDs a camp enough if thereUFFFDs no camp or a very small one

umm wasnt this mining competition an alliance tournament geared more toward the rest of the eve playerbase the industrials i thought the idea was a sound one and the excitement could still be there with a lot more strategy involved than just higher dps or higher tank than the other guyas for the blowuptheotherguy tournaments i find those rather boring it comes down to how much isk an alliance can field against the other alliance
the alliance tourny is the only sporting event which i attend it passes my stringent sports guide line ofis it a blood sport in which people fight to the death for glory and honor if not the gtfoi suppose rugby comes close to qualifying but theres not enough death and explosionsi also want to see the combo of 4 logistics ships take on a horde of lolraxesedit because this ed me offyou sir have obviously never watched the alliance tournament i suggest you watch one before telling me about the strategy invovled
blasters are getting the shaft as a side effect to the nanonerf
whats going to stop you from flying with an ab
im going to go with common sense and logic if you think that an afterburner will be an effective mod on a blasterthron then just lol
time to target is essiential with any blasterboat due its very limited range currently blasters are well balanced in the sense that you may or may not die before getting into range using abs would mean death without a shot fired well a hit that issummary thread of important posts
the time to get into effective engagement range actually fitting an ab can make it take twice to three times as long to get into range its not at all unthinkable that this can make it impossible to deal effective damage in a gang getting into range is extremely importanthowever thats only half of the problem  the second part of the problem is that the 60 web uncovers what was already a hole in the tracking formula  it becomes increasingly difficult for blasters to deal effective damage even supposing that they can manage to get into range blasters with 90 webs are extremely sensitive to transversal  the problem gets almost infinitely worse when the average transversal in web range goes up by 34x 10  40  4x increase in transversal adjusting for slower ships gives a 3x increase in tranversalcome on vista you know better liang
thx for the effort to post it here but i donUFFFDt think it will go anywhere further here as in the game devolopment forum the thread got tons of info also a lot of good math and input from blaster ship usersbellum even changed the op because nothing realy happend not a single note about it in the dev blog not a dev post that explains the planed route and focusing on the problems that it cause not a single adjustment about it on sissi in the current statethink the remove of gun tracking and range was more like a accident glad they at least looked into missles a bit not realy intedet as a test with a adjusted system the changes of the nano nerf hit any unanoed ship used in small scale and solo pvp just as hard as any nanoed by making it fare harder to control range tackle targets pin them down with webs and hit in web range all the core elements of blaster ships that are needet to survive and be effective geting a hit where the usablity is more than just qestionalbeit is qutestionalbe allready now under current tc conditons after it blaster ships are at the reciving side of the nerfbat since 2 years non stop now but this compleetly removes them from the list of usable pvp ships together with a huge amount of ships that are geared to solo and small scale pvp in her orginal wayin the beginning i was for the nano nerf turning speeds down to a more sane level alowing more counters and give other fitting styles a come back but as it turned out this patch nerfs so many things in solosmall scale pvp that it is not even funny to see for somebody that loves and does the so called dead pvp style named solo if somebody think this is a stelth nano whine check my stats on bc i donUFFFDt like nano ships and donUFFFDt use them very often and yes i got some in my hangar bottom line they donUFFFDt care thats it
djego i know we havent always seen eye to eye but i couldnt agree more ccp simply doesnt care at this point blasters and acs have been deliberately sidestepped at every turn when ccp has discussed the nano nerfits really frustrating though because they gave us plenty of time to realize that there was a nano nerf coming over a year and some of us got to training things that didnt have anything to do with nano ships  ships that had been traditionally effectivenerfing battleship massaccelerationvelocity and the web nerf was just out of left field though the game is roughly fine outside of a few nano problems and is balanced far better than its been in ages adjustments of this magnitude make it a brand new game in everything but the abysmal ui and even worse pve experiencepeople like you are the the people ill miss most when i end up dropping 3 35m sp characters on the floorliang
well from the sisi testing i have been doing an ab works pretty well however it is just sisi testing do also remember that if you do get into 75km range assuming you had a mwd you will have some inertia build up that will get you close i assume most people fit a web to their blasterbloat where it would be needed tovery small gangs so once you do get inside that 75km range you will both have inertia and a web im not saying thats perfectly good but do remember that all your targets are going to be equally as slow as you i think its a matter of blaster boats taking a bit more actual skills than they used to however this is just based on theory and i think we will have to wait and see until the final tweaks have been made to sisi to see how it actually works out theres still daily changes to sisi all the time
exactly  and sisi testing usually discounts the situations where someone literally does not want to engage you getting inside 75km before kicking off your disruptor is simply not an option even the slowest of ships are able to warp before a blaster ship can cross the required range to put a point on someone fitting the scram  dual web is simply so that you can get someone going slow enough to actually deal damage to someone why should this be required when you can get 8093 of blaster damage from a certain other turret ship out to 50kmas a general rule they will not be as slow as you are theres multiple reasons not everyone armor tanks and not everyone is running in battleships in fact itll be flat stupid to fly a bs sized blaster ship after this patch this patch is probably not supposed to nerf things that werent even working as well as should be expected on tq yet it doesif it were just a matter of using skill it would be fine  but its not additionally there should be a certain amount of consideration for the difficulty with which you are able to successfully bring your damage to bearaccording to what ive read there are changes by the hour on sisi these days but theyre almost wholly focused on the new missile damage formula in any case that doesnt explain why ccp has deliberately ignored and side stepped the blasterac issue time and time again when its been brought upliang
and it actually looks like there was a live dev blog where zulupark has said that there are no problems with blasters after his previous record of believing that the helios had 3 high slots and that gallente recons were not negatively affected by the damp nerf i give upccp has hired morons and has decided to suicide eve i guess its a good time for certain other mmos to be coming out at least theyre more fun anywayliang
well i would realy sugest reading the thread a bit it isnUFFFDt this bad like many other threads regarding changes and stayes on topic most of the timeproblem is everything bigger than a frigate will need a mwd to get in range quick especialy when fitted with turrets that got a short range it is possible to use ab on cruisers and hacs and it is indeed very effective in 1o1s but it is sissi people want to fight you while in general pvp on tq you have to force them not to warp off most of the timehere starting the problems when it takes to long to get in range most of the targets will warp off so you need a disruptur to stop the other ship from warping off the scrambler sounds good in theorie but any ship that got a doubt if it can win will be warped off long before you in range for a scrambler the other point is the ship need fare more capmore mwd cycles to get in range and it takes fare longer meaning you take fare more damage most of the time since blaster ships got the shortest range and have to mwd into web range to be effective most off the time this is realy a big drawbackthe interia will carrie you further even with mwd off but the target will move out of your range even within web range a plated blaster ship deaccelate like a soap on a wet flore with the 60 web it is very unpredictalbe where it lands so both ships have to manuver in web range even more than out of web range that puts blaster ships in a disavatage in the end because it got the shortest range a thorax with ions or electrons are mostly helpless against a other cruiserfrig if itUFFFDs further away than 45 km of the target with mwd shut down it allready looses the fight if you are still able to use it you burn more cap by mwding in web rage a blaster bs got a very hard time to the other ships will get close and start orbiting what is absolutly enught at a cruiser class even webbed to outrun tracking compleetlythis is a serious problem for any kind of short range fitted solo ship in the cruiser bc and bs class hope you keep the liang forum bot running at least realy not shure the game changed much in the 25 years that i play it most of the time not in the better direction in my personal opinion but well we will seeedit damn the liang forum bot was faster than me
im not certain that im willing to give ccp the cash that it would take to keep liang up i could buy a bottle of liquor per month or try 3 new mmos per month with the cash ill save from dropping eveill miss the really exceptional people that i met in eve though im thinking about dropping an eve mail address into the forums for people that want to get ahold of me for now warhammer is probably the best solution  liangs settled down there as a shadow warrior on iron rockliang
totally offtopic but guildcafecom is a nice place to keep in touch with mmo buddies
great link thanks ive been sitting here plotting a way to post my email address without getting spammed to deathliang
when i started playing a little over a year ago i chose galente because of their awesome ship designi didnt know i was getting on board a sinking boat at first i was excited about the nano nerf because that meant that my deimos that i had been skilling up for a long half a year was finally going to pay off and that ships that i could never dream of catching would finally be in range to die then this  comes out it really woudlnt be that hard to fix really just give blasters a boost in tracking or hell dps so they could compensate for the lesser damage they pumped out at this point about the only thing theyre good for is suplimental dps when shooting at titans and other cap ships please stop nerfing galente before you lose 14 of your player base because the race sucks
the tracking formula needs fixing do the devs not understand the concept of size vs distance fix that and blaster tracking issues go away then work can be done on the dps balance between blasterstorpspulsespersonally id say cut the damage on the latter two
edit all for the nano nerf but not in the way it is done now

why not myk

mixing ingame events with out of game events is just flat out wrongingame tournamentlottery whatever  has nothing to do with a beer up in birmingham or whateverso wrongand im not even touching on how they messed the whole merging thing up all events posts seems to have been lost
this was a part of the forum reworking issue we raised with ccp just 2 weekends agohowever it was a case of mewho raised the issue talking at ccpwrangler was there to discuss the issue but there was no discussion as he didnt seem to care all that muchim disappointed in that i will raise this issue as soon as possible merging those 2 forums is nonsense
ive got a lottery thread going which i was happy to see on top of the events forum seeing it on top of events and gatherings just makes me feel guilty for blocking out mention of rl meetups in exchange for a lottery post being on page one i dont know exactly how the forums should look but these two being together is silly
i beg to differ bunyip flies a hulk and a mackinaw and is heavily into mining and manufacturing i explained in my webpage that the 5 mins warning will allow those who are afk for a short bit to react to the message in locali have no problem with mining and my ore distribution idea should prove that i do have a problem with the people who get an iteron 5 with 1 mining laser and set it to a field while they go to work or those who use third party programs aka macros to mine and deflate the economy of the gameif the macroers are taken out or at least hindered pretty greatly it will put more people into mining since it will be an economically feasable choice and thats the goal im trying to achieve my idea in no way harasses those who pay attention to this game even if they forum trollhandle an emergency with their kidsgrab a bite or a drinki will not engage in the mudslinging that you are trying to do i simply state the facts and ill let the people decide on my credentials based on my input and views in the forums which i use so often
merely being in space should never be a reason to get aggresion from somebody in high sec
this op delivers so why stop at gendersometimes i like to look at boobies which my male avatar lacks and as such i should be able to switch to a female avatar so i can wear skimpy clothes as well
avatars are nothing like any other action in eve theyre a onetime choice that cant be reversed or compensated for in any way with skills if you get some set of skills you can always get the other set of skills with ships if you buy one ship you can always make more isk and get another ship with an avatar you do it once and youre stuck not only that but you had to make the choice with a complete and total lack of information on its future consequences its ridiculous that ccp should force people to make such a permanent choice without having any idea of what it will doi certainly did not know that it would be my ingame appearance i understood that my ingame appearance was that of a spaceship ccp is suddenly changing it so that those previously irrelevant decisions now suddenly have consequences some of which i could never have possibly predicted ie the bloodlines suddenly having visible differences if ccp is going to arbitrarily change what impact those decisions have i should be given the option to reconsider my choicei know ccp is going to let you remake your avatar since its not possible to port your portrait into the ambulation system i just dont know to what degree theyll restrict your options
can you say vanity avatar o honestly i dont think its going to be that big of a dealbut oh well
guess i will laugh at people who just went for some i dont need charisma anyways chars and now got ty avatars but but the forums told me to get an achura to be coolwell now live with it as you didnt put even little effort into creating your charavatar you clearly not even a little bit rp minded so why care now
talking about ambulation anyone know when it is due to be released
20090
i hope we get a bit of a wardrobe to choose from if not at first maybe further down the line maybe the chance to buy new clothes pay for a haircut a tattoo maybei can see customising their avatars being a great way to get people to spend isk
so youre a repressed little gay oh god i cant be staring at a guys rear yet i am still staringdo you people even think about it before you make a new thread i mean its just obvious from a game design perspective why you should actually be the same gender race and bloodline as your old avatar i dont see how im scared of my sexuality is a valid excuse to change that design
if its so obvious then would you mind explaining itthis is asiofjioaewfs main i originally posted on asiofjioaewf by accident yes i did put effort into creating my avatar and yes i am rp minded but there were no rp capabilities in the game at the time i made my avatar so there was no point in rping if i wanted to see a bunch of lines of text next to pictures of heads id go to an irc chat room
because all the other decisions i could of researched beforehand to work out the effects and as i said in the op i dont care if my first avatar choice limits me later my problem is that there is currently no way for players to know what avatar options ambulation will limit us toso tell me what other decisions i could of made that permanently limit me which i couldnt of researched beforehand my portrait is the small icon on my posts and ingame my avatar will be the look i have while walking around in stations we dont get to see what avatars look like until ambulation reaches the test serveri like my current portrait and even if i didnt i knew that i would be stuck with it when i made it my problem here is that when ambulation comes along i have no idea if i will like the avatar options open to methis would be an option assuming that character trades are still allowed when ambulation comes out and that there arent enough people wanting to do this to drastically inflate the character prices
and premium graphics is forgotten so quicklythank you ccp for premium rather then eve2
so what if i borrow the money start my own corp transfer it to my corp wallet and then never put isk into my personal wallet againi can still buysell things im not really crippled in any way
as detailed thus far the lender can draft it from your corp account if you have access only way around that is to transfer it to corp wallet and then give up roles solution could be to limit role grantingremoval when under a debt contract requiring that the debt be paid before the roles can be changed by any character for any character essentially the toon is hotpotato until the debt is paid backthis isnt a tool to prevent scammingcurrently missing in the financial toolbox areconvenient easily verifiable and demonstrable proof of debt and terms of debt via the process of initiating debtways to keep financial agreements honored when corp shuffling is involved and no scamming was initially intendedweak enforcement of casual playerplayer loans to lower the propensity to run with the money current barrier carries zero consequencescollateral system for characters with large amounts of liquid assets nonliquid equity as collateral sets 50 as maximum leverage with capability to leverage against wallet 100 is maximum while staying solventthese roles are what this tool is for
ive always wanted this mechanic but your missing a few big factors that you need with any loan1down payment2collaterali would actually prefer a collateral system rather than a collection system if you put a ship on as collateral then you could hawk your raven for the money to fit it assuming you made enough money to repay the lender then you kept the money and the raven if you failed to do so then youd lose your collateralit would be cool if you could put the ceo role as collateral mortagaing your soul
i cannot say that im innocent of any ghost training but i did not abuse it i only used it for two skills while i had to take breaks from the game for a short time what im upset about is their handling of the situation giving people two days of warning before yanking the plug and offering flimsy excuses for their actionsit was ccps right to stop ghost training but they couldve done it in a far more diplomatic way in doing this they shot themselves in the proverbial foot ccp needs a better channel for communication to players and they need to give the players a chance to present their side to the developers before such rash action
you have made an accusation against ccp lying and i fail to see how your offered proof is actually proof of any sort they stopped 30 and 90 day gtc plus 50 and 100 day ones instead opting to sell 60 day ones as they are a product of ccp they can decide a price and charge what they wish as far as i know credit card or other subscription payments have not been changedcomparing prices to play the game against 30 and 90 day gtc isnt a fair comparision since they no longer exist obviously ccp want players to pay longer term subscriptions as it makes for easier financial planning known cashflows etc essentially what you are highlighting is that the game got more expensive to play if you buy gtc as ccp sell gtc to 3rd parties it would make sense that they still require a base cost then profit added on for resellers hence they are more expensive than paying ccp directyou also alludeto other of those things what other things show they liearithron
i found that artical muddled the issue more than it clarified it because it is an artical written by a third party it is hard to know how much of the liesmisinformation in that artical come from ccp and how much comes from mmorpgcomthe revised dev blog as it is now does a much better job of presenting the case for the changeyes ccp bungled this announcement it should have had more warning and less misinformation in its original release however i think that once ccp saw their mistake they have done what can reaonably be done to correct itstill it wouldnt hurt for the csm to remind ccp of the importance of being upfront and honest with their player base and making sure that their announcements are handled properly ccp established its roots with an open relationship between the developers and the players lies misinformation and general spindoctoring is expected from a company such as blizzard ccp has set themselves up to a higher standard hopefully they continue to strive for it tell it the way it is and dont insult us with bullas for the merrits of this specific change the nerf bat will adventually hit everyone this particular nerf bat has hit very close to home for myself but such is life if i am truly honest with myself i can understand why this change was made even if the initial presentation was lacking
i am voting against the nerf of speeds
well i am voting for it
vote forvote against
honestly you have no clue if ccp are making more money or not from their gtc changes andor the ghost training changes so dont make statements about ithow are the gtc sellers being greedy dont you want to get the most bang for your buck with anything you do both in eve and in rl
not signed its basic supply and demand why should i sell you a cheap gtc if there are a dozen people lined up to buy it from me at a higher price any sane and rational person would do exactly what those sellers are doing this isnt some incomprehensible evil or market manipulation conspiracyits no different than any other aspect of eves economy if you get ccp to step in and reduce your gtc costs i expect ccp to step in and reduce my ship costs i want hacsrecons for 20 million isk greedy sellers shouldnt be allowed to raise the prices as high as they have
ccp cant cap the cost or the whole idea behind the gtc system falls on its assthe price needs to determined by supply as well as demand if the supply side sees a large discrepancy between the isk it gets for a dollar here compared to at ige et all they will sell less cards and fuel more isk sellersccp donUFFFDt want that since itUFFFDs both harmfull and a loss of income
there is no conspiracy and accusation definately wont get you anywhere but theres no doubt the balance has been upset id say its rather like the ammount of hacs builders  sellers drop  while the ammount of hac buyers went up you would be annoyed that you had to pay 200mil for that hac if you could get oneif i was a seller  i would be driving prices up too after all you got to look after number one but i would certainly call my self greedy and rub my hands together all the way to the bank but even in rl  theres laws methods and amendments put in place to try stop monopoly inflation and a broad economic failure although it happens from time to time which is what we are seeing here we normaly dont realise it and do something about it when its too late but that dosnt mean we should just simply do nothing about it
fair enough point takenguess we will just have to let it run its course then
to the opyou are playing the game for free buying the gtc with isk quit complaining tbfh
if no one can afford them the price will go down as demand decreases are people really this ed about how the free market works
this the only reason prices are so high is because people are willing to pay them clearly there are people out there who want that gtc more than you do and theyre willing to pay extra to make sure they get access to the limited supply first if prices exceed the equilibrium point where demand becomes less than supply prices will drop again as the sellers start competing to have the lowest price and attract the limited number of buyersthis is economics 101 deal with it
well i have been told i have an iq of that of a gallah 
if you flesh the idea out and it is reasonable i would support it but right now all i get the impression is you want like a 1k damage 20km range mini dddthat or you really really hate phoenix pilots and would to further enrage them
christ darius you are breaking all sorts of preconceptions for me lately man stop scaring me and do something evil and sinister otherwise i just might have to vote for you damn it
nobody said the skill couldnt train as long as the account was paid vacations and deployments are the subject of we need a skill cache now ghost training was never necessary for extended afk sessions it was a necessity of idontpayformysp playersvacation and deployments shouldnt and wont kill accounts that are set up to be paidhave enough gtcs losing your jobquit eve and get a life
the best saylors stand on the landsa knife can cut from both sideswhat is wrong with ego and business if at the end its a survival of the fittestas long as the csm candidates remain honest loyal and trustworthy to their promises and do their best to contribute on developing a better game i dont see the problem on selling the brand a little ur idea on the polls systems is a nice one i agree something like that would give more accurate statistics on certain topicseven if ccp created csm for pr stuntings what is wrong with that it gives players an extra option to set a goal to work for or something like that you know its coolcsm could form a strong in game platform competing with ccp to fill those laggy 00 gaps and all that if indeed participation will occur in the near futureits up to the candidates to figure out how to arrange their agenda for their membership and hopefully the third or 7th csm will be able to overrule a tanknerf if the players want to by then because we are all playing battleship online from the upcoming speed nerf
say what
two things one you may want to edit your cv a bit  even most geeks make fun of larping two whats this take care business on your website it doesnt seem to be a csm slate given that none of the rest of them are running  is it just a group of friends youre using as campaign advisors also best of luck to you
maybe but then again people that roleplay in a videogame get made fun of as well by the nonroleplayers but that does not mean that roleplaying in whatever way is dumb i think that roleplay spices things up in eve and i dont see me getting some fresh air a few times a year being bad anyone can apply for the take care platform these are people that have shown interest in discussions and i consult with them to hear their opinions on issues usually i talk to a few of them and a few random people at the same time being a csm is not a solo endeavour you have to consult with the players and these are some of people that help me in that aspect i should explain this a bit better in my op thanks for that
after you and the current csm balanced concord read destroyed high sec pirating what game style are you planning to destroy if elected again 
could you start with trolls pretty please ankh
i have to say my experience of eva in the csm online in virtual chats face to face at ccp hq and in the months since has been uniformly good shes dedicated and capable and approached the csm concept with an open mind and analytical eye even during the worst bits of the first session eva kept her head and remained balanced and positive and helped a great deal as one of the officers on the council even though by her own admission she didnt have much experience of matters eve pvp she has listened to those that have and has turned her formidable intellect to solving the problems faced by small unit fighting in the increasingly turgid environment of 00 sovereignty war personally i think shed make an excellent chair for the 2nd csm and i hope shes able to build on the support she managed last time around she truly deserves a 2nd seat on the csm and i think we the players will be benefited tremendously if she goes all the way and wins this thing
your record shows the opposite tbh ie voting down banes capital ships online proposal
to be honest it was a muddleheaded proposal that needed to be voted down by anyone that actually read the small print trying to address a perceived prevalence of capital ships in 00 fighting by actually reducing the skill requirements to fly capital ships and make them even more prevalent how does that make sense
if you were voting on a design document that ccp were bound by blood oath to implement then that would be a valid point but even if the details were muddled something better couldve been hashed out with ccp facetoface effectively voting to put off even discussing the ridiculous capital spam you see these days was a huge disappointment and easily the csms biggest failure so far unless youre just fine with capital blobs titan spam and only big players who can afford these toys dominating 00whatever your view its certainly the antithesis of small gang love in any case
like jade said that was due to the fine printand bane voted against issues that would imply a rework of 00 sovereignty mechanicsthere is cause and effectthe cause is the stupid poscentered warfare the effect is blobs because people will bring the biggest fleet as that guarantees a winbesides it was very clear from what direction bane was coming in his proposals either nerf our opponents who have more capitals than we so we can blob them with our subcapitals or allow all of us to fly capitals as well  at least that is how it appeared to mei want to deal with the cause and not bandaid the effect in some halfassed way to this effect i would propose objectives for small mobile gangs to accomplish this would force existing powers to patrol and secure their space if not opponents or just random groups of roaming spacebrigands will have a nice opportunity to come and pillage with small fast gangs they should be able to raid and make off with some loot before those nasty capital ships arrive on the scenethis will make 00 as a whole more dynamic and interesting especially for those with only a limited amount of time to spend on eve as something can be accomplished in a matter of hours instead of picking your nose for ages until that stupid pos comes out of reinforcedeither way  we will discuss 00 mechanics at the fanfest and i will discuss all parts of this issue the 00 sovereignty mechanics pos warfare and capital shipsin addition i want to see some more incentives and depth added to factional warfare which would encourage people to actually fight over the plex sites in there right now fw is just an isk sink but i think it should be a low to medium income carreer optionlowsec pvp remains tricky with ccp turning down the bounty hunting ideas still id like to see improvements for lowsec and playerdriven justicesecurity as well
my name is qwaarjet and i support this candidate good luck mate
thanks everyone for support
you sayallowing wardecs against individuals even when in npc corps is something i think needs considering as a point of principle but practically its not important currently alongside other issuesdo i understand you correctly that you are for the idea of allowing players or corporation to wardec a pilot that is in a npc corp
adding my support to lavistas campaign ive worked with him for over a year on ebank during which time hes become a core member of our team during his previous csm term he showed a level of maturity exceeding his age i think he learn a lot through the process and would be well placed to build on what the first term achievedgood luck
qftsigned
since i am not running for this term my votes will go to lavista vista in hopes that it will help the fight against rmt
i think you have my vote this time  one of the most coherent csm members i thinkunless some of the new runners convicne me off course
election tip of the day day 1the csm has taken lots of my time these past 5 months has it been worth it yeahi love the idea of the csm and im hoping with csm2 we can try and reshape and improve the council to be more time effective so we can spend more time doing what we are supposed to communicate with the communityi have written lots of stuff about how i would like to see the csm heres most of itthe morals of csm  achieving cooperation chairman redifinitionstreamlining communication for better transperancystreamlining communication for better communication with ccp on issuescouncil of ship modificationshow to avoid wasting timerotating moderator
how exactly would the game mechanics work so corporations or alliances could claim lowsec systems as their ownthe concept is good but how you implement it is crucial
im not sure fortunately i dont have to be ccp is not looking for us to submit patches because they have hundreds of their own employees to do that theyre looking for us to submit ideas and thats what im trying to do here if i try to get too specific the proposal will actually lose utility for them since it loses the ability to be fit into existing design plans and it limits the scope of where they can go with it without having to worry about players accusing them of betrayal they have coders and testers and i trust a team of fulltimers to do a better job designing and implementing this system than a single amateur can ill tell you my rough design goals though which i expect ccp to basically share i want lowsec sovereignty to be attainable in a single system by a small 510 member corporation if they are active dedicated and competent i dont want the rewards to be too great  the goal is to allow you to defend your space not to give you a boatload of money for checking off an arbitrary goal or two and the method for attaining this sovereignty should be via doing things that actually make sense both from an rp perspective and from a gameplay perspective establishing money sinks that serve only as welldefended spots your opponent has to knock over to take control deathstar poses is definitely something to be avoided i certainly agree that implementation is crucial as well this is not an idea im deadset upon seeing implemented because i know very well that it can be done wrong and it would be bad for the game if it was id rather see it not happen than see it happen badly however its something that i think could be done very well if all goes right and as such i consider it worth bringing forward

issler dainze  csm candidate  let me be your voice when you scream in spacewell its official i have received notification that i have been accepted to run for a spot on the 2nd csm woot exciting times aheadso i just wanted to say again that i am excited at the prospect of helping make sure the voice of the average pilot in included in ccps plans for our verse i know i have the skills and determination to help make a difference i hope youll give me have a chance to see what i can do for youstuffs getting better stuffs getting better every dayissler dainzecsm candidateceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord
issler dainze  csm candidate  let me be your voice when you scream in spacethought id talk about aliens in eve i think it is an interesting topic i cant say that im for some major incursion of little green men but thats not to say i wouldnt like to see something involving aliens basically im for ideas that add some storyline possibilities some new variations in our eve experiences of offer an excuse for creation of some new cool stuff so what could we do with aliens here are just a couple of ideas1 strange new spacial annomolies that can be scanned and that lead to the encounter with aliens we already have ai that is out of control and other mob factions aliens could be interesting new mobs perhaps give them behaviors that would make it seem as though they are studying us or better yet preparing for some sort of invasion2 let them drop something special cool alien technology add some npcs that seem to be collecting it and maybe add some sort of cover up storyline to go along with that could create a premise for some interesting new missions3 make them able to pop in and pop out in a manner that would suggest some sort of better interdimensional technology imagine you are mining and suddenly a group of alien ships pop in and scan you then just as mysteriously dissappear also give them tactics that are truly alien right now all mobs pretty much act the same some reason for variation in the mob experience seems like a good thing to consider4 they could drop earth artifacts that could create a whole bunch of interesting story line developments imagine for example that some races leadership begin to react to the idea that life on earth has continued and begin huge political struggles or shifts in religous beliefs that create a drive to find a way to create a way back to earth5 our first encounters could come as a result of the opening of some new space just finding alien archeology alone could create some great new content6 have them provide us with some sort of puzzle to solve maybe they lead to the discovery of an alien gate that can only be made to work when some secret is uncovered this could be how some new systems could be introduced7 or here is a crazy idea not everyone sees them at the same time ccp could roll this out unannounced and we could create eves own ufo nuts imagine the fun as you try and convince all your corp members that there really was a ship right there in the belt scanning you when they didnt see it i can hear the accusations of space madness already so what im suggesting is not dramatically alter the eve we love but lets face it in the vast verse there has to be others out there somewhere and those others could create some great story lines missions and rich new content without adversely affecting the eve we now enjoy i wouldnt be pushing for aliens to be added to eve but if the opportunity to suggest new content in eve comes up i think aliens offer some great opportunitiesstuffs getting better stuffs getting better every dayissler dainzeceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord

this is a good candidate i hope he gets elected
im open to questions from the panel 
you say regarding what you stand foreg my core principlesbelieves of environments largermore dense solar systems vastly increased resources in 00 subsystem warfare and culture of introducing counters lore instead nerfing content more small gang pvp war declaration victory conditions turning a risk avoidance mentality to a risk management mentalitywhat exactly do you mean bylargermore dense solar systemsculture of introducing counterslore instead nerfing content not sure what lore meansitukki
this refers to how i believe space and star systems in eve are far too small instead of a solar system supporting hundreds of people corporations of 20 can effectively maximise the resources of a constellation alliances sprawl over vest portions of the map and the ability to coexist with smaller entities within regions is extremely difficult do to the limited number of resources and the lack of variety in the ways in which systems can be harvestedessentially my goal would be to make solar systems feel bigger and more valuable by making the majority of 00 systems resource rich and different in there compositiondown the line this naturally leads on to environments new possibilities and niches for technologies structures and play styles and corporations and alliances eventually adapting to the environment in a way that makes them uniquethese are really one in the same thingi believe the way in which changes to the game are made violate the premise of an rpg or at least do more harm to the brand and the experiance than the game design improvements that are usually followi believe that in the majority of cases rp can be used to as a method of either finding a solution to a balance problem or at least explaining it once changes are brought to bear its this type of maturity that seeps down into the community it sets the tone  imagine instead of a heap of people thrashing out a bunch of random figures and there own points of view about a subject people would think more about the brand the history the way the balance of power may inevitably change and suggest changes based on an active storyline see loreinterweaving them deeper into the fabric of the game obviously this would all be done under the ccp guiding hand but this would at least help bridge the disconnect between the player base and the scripted lore 
i fear that the 00 npc gatecamp is not a good idea this will definetaly hurt people that want to venture about 00 alone or in a small group let alone industrial ships
the excitement of that comes with the risk and reward of 00 space is diminished when there isnt anything out there to challenge you there arent going to be player gatecamps and roaming gangs all the time and that can mean a person could go 20 jumps in 00 and never be challenged as for traveling alone some would say that is irresponsible in an industrial ship ive always had someone scout ahead for me when i was moving precious cargo or in a slowly maneuvering shipi want ccp to inject more challenges into the game and upgrading what the npcs can do would be a good way to do this if they could program in a way for npcs to utilize stargates there could be convoys in lowsec or 00 which players could intercept i see a lot of potential here
so now that the smalltalk is done with gimme a chance to convince you
im more than slightly certain that i support vily although he did kill me once when i was unarmed and defenseless 
hey you cant make an omelette without breaking a few eggs pods are like eggs right
who the hell are youi am promithius go figure many of you already know me and many more have absolutely no idea who i am so here is a brief introductioni have been a member of the eve community for going on 4 and a half years now iv been a ceo a capital fc some of my more notable madness occurs at this point an alliance leader and i dare to say there are few areas of eve i am yet to encounter apart from those mysterious zombie entitys that lurk at the bottom of your celestial groups in your overviews seriously go checkwhy should we vote for you hopefully many of you will cast your votes based on your experiences of my dedication and determination and perhaps some of you because your mad to be serous for a moment i chose to stand for the csm this year because i feel that the gap between ccp and the player base is not only vast but its widening my intention is to work tirelessly to bridge that gap taking your ideas and opinions and making your voices heard by ccpif there is one thing that i have felt constantly throughout my time in eve its that my words have never carried to the top i intend to change thatthats all well and good but how will you help mein every way i can tell me your opinions and thats what i will deal with after all that is the point of the csmfeel free to contact me with any questions and thought either by replying to this post or by visiting my website where there is a contact form you can use
hiya prom  hes been my ceo and ummm best freinds for way to long  when he says he wants to do somthinghe does it except mining vote for him couse he wont stop tryingshep
having known you for a long time promithius and knowing you are true to your word you have my vote alreadyalthough what is your stance on the nano nerf
this is why i think he is so coolwhen i joined eve i was all alone not knowing what the hell i was doingthen one day i was jumping around amarr space when i got a window open to find it filled with ppl one of them being promhe from then of had me under his wing and helped me grow in the game to this dayall in all he has a vast amount love for the game and the ppl he plays with and not only them but all in gamepersonal gain is a must in the game but he will sometimes put alot of effort in others even if it takes him of his planed path in gameso i say big up to the prom you are tops in my book m8 regardslickter
i believe that the upcoming nano nerf is yet another example of the lack of direct communication between ccp and the players yes some balancing is necessary we all know that nano has become the staple of roaming gangs and not rebalancing the mechanics would just let the situation get more and more out of hand after i encountered a 45kps crow a few days ago i came to the realization that any ship able to go so fast that they are for all reasonable purposes invulnerable is not a good thing however and this is a big one i dont think that the way ccp are suggesting these changes are the best way to go about resolving the issue the idea is clearly unpopular almost everyone i have spoken to believes that its to harsh a change and i am inclined to agreeso in short i believe that the nano changes were made with good intention but very poorly executed with a distinct lack of listening to peoples opinions
i fully endorse the candidacy of promithius we dont always see eye to eye but he has always been reasonable to deal with and i have found him to be someone who doesnt make important decisions until he has canvassed all the facts a rare quality in someone with such murderous skills and hardware prom is also someone who is not on my buddy list why because he is my friendi would recommend you vote for prom if you want a strong leader who has the kahunas to stand up and be countedgood luck prom
1 vote herehave known prom for about 2 years now when he introduced my old corpthe wild hunt into fatal alliancealways willing to answer any questions and is always free for a convogreat guy and will definetely be getting my vote

i met prom just shortly after starting to play eve he has been a wealth of information to my corp and myself you have my vote bud
vote for prom  hes a good guy always willing to help even smallfry like me 
how could i not vote for this guy he is a legend got my vote
this guy knows his stuff looking forward to working with ya in person
if you could take 2 topics straight to ccp what would those be apart from the nano nerf
good guy got my support
a lot of people have come into this thread saying they are a friend of proms i would not class us as friends as we dont chat often enough the times i have chatted to him he has been pleasant enough very direct and straight to the pointthe reason i have chosen to post in this thread in support of prom is that having looked at other candidates and knowing about proms personality i cannot think of a better person to put forward for the positioni have yet to hear him brag about the great things he has accomplished in his eve career and in the interests we share in the game he has proven to be level headed and straight to the point as an associateprom gets my vote not because hes a friend but because i believe he will be very effective in the role of csm
well lets see i was wondering how to express why i thought promithius would make a good csm and while having a conversation with friends i described him to a alliance mate in a flipped way then realized it was accuratepromithius in this conversation was described by me as cliffs notesdefined cliffsnotes formerly cliffs notes and often incorrectly cliffnotes are a series of student study guides available primarily in the united states the guides present and explain literary and other works in pamphlet form or online endorsers say the guides help readers understand complex works while detractors say they let students avoid even reading themmy definition as it pertains to promknowledgeable insightful articulate and accurate i use this term to describe prom because all that have met him at first glance see him as arrogant and having somewhat of a god complextruth be told once you get to know him and the residents of eve you understand how this can happen among the sea of noobs nerds blood thirsty pirates and pea sized brain cell players sits promithiusalways willing to assist those who are willing to answer but throwing the chaff to the wind to separate it from the wheat of the field his abrasive side soon becomes warm after he has discerned your intent and adequate ability to communicate and think rationallyhe is a abundant source of information and ideas and willing to go the extra yard for those that truly wish to excel in eve as opposed to exist i was and am still amazed by his answers hence the descriptionwhen asked a question prom gives you a clear plain articulate and brief synopsis of the concept its practicality and chance of success or failure and to my amazement 99 of the time even the cerebrally challenged grasp the meaning and information easily and completely in summation i would have to say prom would make a awesome csm simply based on his ability to communicate unilaterally clearly and informatively on a personal note he cares for the game and the people that play it and when he saysyou can take that to the bank  the promithius i know never makes statements like that unless he means it and never goes half way and turns around he has my vote just based on his dedication alone his personality and abilities are just icing on the cakeif you dont know prom personally do yourself a favor and get to know him and enhance your game and personal experience in evetexaswarlordexecutor north domain defense forces alliance
after playing eve for about a year prom kindly accepted me into subach corp a great leader and a great organizer he is truly dedicated to eve and will be a great resource for making the game better im one of those players with a very busy life and randomly gets to play an evening or two every two weeks in despite of this prom has always included me in whats been going on if i wanted to enuff said the man knows his eve
its difficult to rant about only 2 things  but if pushed i would speak about the old gtc issue and how in my mind and the minds of those i regularly speak to it has never been resolved as far as we can see all this has served to do is increase the price of plying eve  it has also artificially pushed up the price for gtcs with isk given that before when you had 30 day and 90  the price of the 30 days put a limit on how much you could charge for the 90s  now we are up as much as 500 mil which is more than we used to pay for 90secondly i would want to raise the issue of the petition system as im sure all of you have experienced the time honored tradition of the copy paste response the system makes the players feel disjointed and as if they are not really being listened to some small changes could help make the system feel a little more player oriented im not entirely sure what those changes might be right now  i have some ideas but that would be the point i would raise
you got my vote prom best of luck mate
thanks for all your support guys and gals  seeing so many of you say such nice things about me makes me think perhaps you are mistaking me for someone else i hope i can live up to the high expectations you all have of me
where do i beginafter joining prom and his corp i realised this was a person that knew what they were doingnot only that he knew how to order things properlyif something needed doing prom has always been a person that could step up to the task when decisions needed to be made he judged accordingly not allowing favouritism to come in the way of fairnessafter seeing many of the hard choices that needed to be made this is a person that defiantly puts others before himselfi think that prom would be a perfect csm candidate 1 votekeep up the good work prom
nice fellow i know him for years even after 4 years he still has passion for the gamehave seen him do many things ingame which makes him a good allrounderi hope you will be elected prommicang
clears throatso my dear prom has decided to take up the responsiblity of csm well if ccp picked any other man or woman they would be stupid this guy has a crazy long fuse that only 1 person can defusemejust ask him about his faction nightmare about 2 years back hehe but really prom has this mind setgive him 15 years and the queen herself would grant this man nobility sir rankme being american i can only guess thats great on a bigger note prom knows about practically everythinghas practically done everything from pos war to station building in 00 to managing whinners in fatal to wellyou get my point again he is prime for the job i have known him for whatlets see herebeen playing for 5ish yearsand found him in like year 2 i thinkso yea a bloody long time he has my vote without question he is able to be direct but not a rude direct he can be crazy but not bouncy wall crazy and he can lead but also at points let others lead his ego is almost never present and almost never vulgarrole model material in my mind and i believe that is the kind of person needing to be to sit in the job title as csm so again vote for him if you want stuff to get done about our beloved eve
looking at the other candidates posts i see im doing it wrong so lets try this againhi im ee21k this is my main some of you may know me from the fan fest the last two years i suppose there may be a few compromising photos of me drinking with the goonswarm from 2006 but i couldnt find them so i think im coveredas for policy if elected to the csm i would pretty much do my job check the forums consolidate the good and interesting ideas into a design outline to present to ccp i enjoy eve casually and that does tend to mean i dont get to experience mass fleet combat spending hours in gate camps or mining ice for 23 hours to power a station ive not done these things and cannot claim to have experience in these areas but that also means im not likely to turn aside any ideas simply because thats how its done if you want your agenda pushed and you honestly think ccp need to hear it and its not simply a tirade of abuse in their direction   ill raise it in a meetingif you are looking for a slogan try this i want to be the public servant of the csmnot that ambitious ill agree but its how i would intend to act if elected

welcome to all players of all racesi am standing at csm to claim the worries faced by the francophone community in eveonline the points of my campaign are the following1UFFFD  access to multilingual support we can have people capable of responding in our mother tongue and met convey our problems to train with or ccp can solve their own problems2UFFFD  the possibility of finding gm or isd francophone resolutions for our bugs etc gameplay problem the next issue will be the rules of engagement sovereignty 00 solutions and pos alliance hq
im a big fan of this game and have been playing it since 2005 my motivation for being elected to the csm is to help ensure that eveonline continues to be a great game to play and that too many changes arent made too quicklyfor the most part my character tends to stay clear of 00 space prefering lowsec space im a proud mission i do have a few petpeeves on some aspects of the game that you may agree or disagree with  let me know your views ghost training  its about time they closed this loophole  not allowing people to play without paying strikes me as common sense new player skill points  id like to slow down the trend that has new players starting with sooo many more skill points compared to what a new player a couple years ago started out with  being able to fly a cruiser should be earned station humpers  really how much fun is it to sit outside a station playing games to gank a ship  macrohaulersmacrominers  id love to see less of this  questions for methanks
are you not concerned about the wellfare of the eveeconomy if macrominers would be removed from the game supply would drop significantly and consequently prices would rise they cons would outweigh the pros significantly
hello my in game name is rorin cutter and i would like to be your representative for the csmmy motto for the vote would have to be what am i asking you to believe in a better future for all eve online players and i can help us get therei have been playing eve since 2006 both in and out of 00rorin has been in and out of both large alliances and small corps living in 00 and empire if youre going to vote then please vote for me
hey voters and candidatesam curious to know if i understand the the rolepurpose of the csm council before casting my voteresponsibility  analyzing and voting on every idea or suggestion brought up by eve players and csm members themselves on the assembly hall forum taking all accepted ideassuggestions to ccp for the iceland meeting informing the eve community on the progress of the ideassuggestions brought to the attention of ccpi believe that being a csm member is alot of work and effort these few lines may not reveal everything you do but isnUFFFDt this essentially what the council does basicly taking ideas from the community that csm think are good and taking them to ccp
well that is indeed the exterior of the csm but there also is an interior part where we answer our truckloads of emails set up ingame discussions and work out documentationtaking all accepted ideas  doesnt cut it as all the threads that you want to support as csm have to be distilled into a document that ccp can use as a csm you also have to present your issues to the council answer questions from your peers and if necessary modify your document based on feedback from them likewise a csm has to do the same for the other council members reading their documents and asking questions before you actually get to the voting partif you do not put much effort into your documents the whole issue is likely to get shot down until you fix it so you do have quite a bit of responsibility when it comes to representing the playerspersonally im in contact with quite a few people that do not want to post on the forums for whatever reason i have to work out their issues and encourage them to post it or add their input to overall ideas and post those myself
good summary ank

the newly named ghost training feature is what keeps me resubing bring it back
im fine with no ghost training as long as a skill queue is implemented in order to allow those actually paying for the game to not get screwed by not being able to login due to rl issues
ccp really messed up with this one ghost training should stay
well im sure you keep cancelling them all the time anyway sogood thing that ccp finally got around to fix this
signed2 years later and people are still asking hint hint
at the very least do a 1 skill quesigned

seeing that still some of the devs believe that not having a skill queue promotes playing eve more ive changed my mind and now support this threadsigned

first of all the removal of ghost training didnt affect me at all i do however have an observation which i would like to make the main justification which ccp provided for banning this form of training is the fact that players could train skills wihtout paying a subscription a kinda of bug ccp concluded that this is unfair on them as a company as well as on other players who pay the subjscription i therefore see lack of subscription as the main problem with ghost trainingwithout getting into whether these reasons are valid or not i do believe that these same arguments should therefore support the idea of skill queue since the lack of subscription was the main problem with ghost training i cant therefore see any problem in principle with skill queue as long as there is an active subscription i do recall one argument against skill queue ccp didnt want people to simply set a long queue without contributing to the game and its economics while this can be easily addressed by setting limits i also believe that as long as an individual pays for a subscription it should be up to him  her to decide if and when they log on in any case in an economically driven real world we all live in i really doubt people will be willing to pay subscriptions without getting anything in return but we need to keep in mind that sometimes we have to focus on rl issues and it might not always be possible for us to monitor skill progress and log on to avoid losing training time which equates to real life money after all and not in game isk this could get more complicated when people own multiple accountsedit in conclusion i am therefore in favour of skill queue 2nd edit checked support rt

yeapi agree
yay im in
dont see the need for any skill queue its just plain laziness
i support this
would it not work just makingputing implants that give 100 or something to atributes on market on sisi
bump and signedits a good idea
dont know if this has been said but how can i test new setups if my sisi char has less skillpoints
as someone whos laptop likes to make me nuke the eve cache every few weeks signed this is one of those why hasnt anyone else thought of this kind of ideas
down with the nano nerf
skill training queue needs to be in this game especially after removing ghost training if the logic is to not let people not paying train then it would also make sense to let paying people train always
not having skill queue does not promote playing the game merely causes a lot of frustrations especially now after you removed ghost training which could be used to make up for whatever training time you lost due to rl so full support for skill queue of some kind
my only complaint is the inability to drag secure cargo cans around o pim sure everyone has the well duh answer as to why so dont bother telling mejust saying thats one of the things i frown at 
first of all this is not a thread to discuss skill queues theres already one thread for that issue theres even another one created when ghost training got nerfed to demand the same thingthis thread is about fighting a well rooted idea in the minds of the developers that not having a skill queue promotes playing eve more from my point of view it does noti have a life i need to spend at least 9 hours working and more time out of my home if you count the time i spend on transports and doing other dutiesunluckily some of the skills at some levels namely level 2 3 and 4 have shorter training times than the time i spend at work and longer than the time i can spend daily playing this game without compromising my personal lifei have a home and a son i need to take care of both and thus my time playing eve daily is limited while it still leaves the weekend free to play more i cant be all weekend pending from a game i need to have some time for me and my son so i cant be every 34 hours returning to my pc just to change a dumb skillnot having a skill queue doesnt change the time i can devote to the game at all it only makes my eve experience more complicated and makes me feel like i have a handicap compared to other players with more free time to playso if you still think that ill play less by having a skill queue in my case you are totally wrongim tired of hearing this idea over and over from the developers it really hurts me and my relationship with the game and ccp suffers every time i read itso please make it clear in my opinion you are totally wrong by believing it a skill queue will be a positive thing for all of us and right now theres no technical reason for not implementing it as for what kind of skill queue id like to see implemented i urge you to read the appropiate thread where there are many different ideas with its pros and consother players may have their own reasons for liking a skill queue these are mineif you player too believe that the devs idea that not having a skill queue promotes playing eve more is wrong please give your support to this thread and express your casethanks for reading
i agree fully but the assembly hall is the wrong place for this thread unless your goal is to have the csm advance a position of general disagreement with ccp with no actual new proposals in it that really isnt something the csm can vote for
my skill training schedule is totally different from my eve playing schedule because like most people i have a life outside evegive us a skill queuesigned
100 agreed
i dont see anything new with your argument here nor have i seen anyone even attempt to refute it
well tbh i thought that one of the duties of the cms was letting the worries of players be heard by the devspreviously the cms talked with ccp about skill queues and this is what we gotas a result some priorities were assigned to the issues presented by the csm like thisi like many other people felt that a mediumhigh priority for this issue was not good enoughbut i waited for some kind of answer to this because i thought that maybe there were other issues that prevented a decision about this subjectfast forward to some days ago the ghost training nerf came and many people who were waiting for an answer to the skill queue problem knew that now there where no other technical issues preventing a skill queue so a thread about the subject appearedbut then yesterday i read thisthe same old song about no skill queue encourages playing eve again we were again back at square 1continues
so i took the opportunity given to ask zulupark again about this since im clearly missing something hereand this is wat i gotso i really hope ccp hammer can explain this because no matter how i look at that statement i really dont get it so i must be missing somethingim not really trying to force anything here i just want to know why they keep saying something i dont understand and that i dont agree with or makes no sense at all to me i must be missing something here and i would really like them to explain it to me skill queue or noti know you are a csm candidate and i hope you will be sensible to other players worries specially one that looks rather demanded by us besides this is the only forum with some kind of voting capability so i considered that and issue that in my view must be addressed by the csm and that need some sort of support by other players fitted this forum nicely sorry if i was wrong about itregards
seems ccp has made their mind up on this the tournament forum has been removed

im in favor of thisanyway let me get it straight and sum up the issues please1 web nerf reduces blaster damage due to tracking or causes blaster ships being unable to hit most of the time2 web nerf makes it more difficult for a blaster ship to remain in range3 speed reduction increases time it takes to get in range4 blaster dps gets approached by torps and lasers which have a much larger range putting blasters at a disadvantageanything else
1 yes 90 webs covered up the problem of large blasters not being able to hit anything inside their own optimal range unless it was held perfectly still2 correct the web nerf particularly in conjunction with the 2pt scram turning off mwds has made it very difficult to maintain range as well as keep the target from escaping by making it back to the gatedock range and jumping out secondly other solutions such as fitting dual webs or a web and a disruptor and a 2pt scram are only viable on ships with 5x mids and additionally take away those ships existing versatility by requiring the extra tackle gear3 the speed reduction increases the time required to cover the same distance requires that more total distance be covered this is very important when trying to tackle a ship trying to get back into dockjump range and also consumes a ton more cap this is critical as you dont want to be completely out of capcap charges when you finally arrive at your required range4 due to a long list of changes resist changes t2 ammo nerfs torp rof buffs ability to tune damage type to weakest resists etc other weapons are able to equal or surpass blaster dps at most common combat ranges and definitely at anything over 810km when targets are within blaster optimal other weapons lasers torps have equal or greater ontarget dps than blasters and blasters are supposed to be unequaled in their damage output by a large marginif you have any specific questions or need exact details about blaster ships their fitting how to fly them etc please feel free to askcontact me here or in gamethanks in advance
i support this thread blasterships need to be looked at
i think ccp decided at one point and saidhey look we got the majority of players using caldari ships lets boost caldari and nerf the rest so the majority is happyseriously i dont understand why missiles get boosted every patch while turrets get hit by the nerf bat with each i wish my blasters would use 0 cap and hit from over 50km while doing 1k dpsedit thumbs up for this one ofc

yeah im sick of gallente getting hit with the nerfbat almost every patch

fueling sounds fine the only other limitation this thing needs to be found is a very small cloaking radius a small group of us have used gscs like this in the past and its amazingly how easily weve been probed out at them several times despite only being uncloaked near them for several secondsa determined enemy will be able to easily capitalize on mistakes such as ships drifting outside the field or momentary disruptions in the cloak that might happen when a new ship enters it or when too much ship mass is present inside it perhaps allow probes to narrow it to within snoop range 5au while its cloaked so that it is possible to pick up ships when not if they make these mistakesa lazy enemy should not be handed their locations on a silver platter at x interval just because they have sov level y just as the anchoring corpalliance should have to work a bit to keep them running you should have to work a bit and exercise a bit of patience and thought to find themcarrierlevel capacity with no sma seems balanced as does the ability to refit gsc capacity is rather small and would be filled by any normal successful pvp operations within a day or two remember that this is a game and requiring fueling interactions on a 24hr basis would be unrealistic and make them too vulnerable sometimes people dont play absolutely every single day 34 days is a realistic fueling timeframealliancewide covert cyno beacon is an excellent idea and would let a determined small group set up a network of these in enemy space to quickly move around with black opsone question im not sure about is accessibility making their location knowable by anyone in the alliance seems like it might limit their usefulness given how easy it is to simply get a spy character into most alliances on the other hand being only accessible by bookmark doesnt sound so great either maybe link their visibility on the solar system map to corp roles
or maybe another way to go about it is it to make it a module that can only be fit by a blackops bs you hit the module and 10 minutes later your bs is transformed into this pirate base and your pod is ejected anyone with the skill to activate the module can reenter and turn off the module give it a cycle time of a couple of days so you still have interaction with some small volume high expense fuel that powers it i like the idea of the base itself not being probable but as ships dock with it its scan res goes up doing it this way gives the enemy whos space you are in the oportunity of probing out and stealing the shipsmaterial instead of just blowing it up
how about simply making it impossible to deploy them if your alliance has sov any level in that system and make them only accessible to the alliance that placed it so that you couldnt use a fake neutral corp to place it in your own space
similar idea 
let me preface this fueling poss sucks srsly its a black hole that eats time and isk better spent elsewhere having fun with that i had an idea on balancing fueling vs the infinite unbalanced utility of such a thing give it a tiny fuel bay that could be easily cheaply filled by something like a black ops or two the fuel would power a long range sensor dampening  cloaking field for 30 days of dormancy while dormant itd be insanely hard to probe out not impossible though and be a visual shimmer  distortion similar to a cloaked ship but bigger maybe make it completely unprobable 55 minutes out of an hour itd be a sensor anomaly that appears and disappears at randomto use it youd fly up to it switch it to an active mode and its fuel requirements would increase tenfold when active you can access whatever services the thing provides and itll cloak any small ships within a 5km bubble or so hell instead of 10x fuel costs tie the increased fuel needs while active to the amount of mass it has to cloak give the transition from dormant to active a one to five minute warm up time too so the quick and the smart could probe you out and the slow stupid or lazy get caught trying to abuse this thingif kept fairly cheap and disposable this would give small operations a means to survive in deep space by stealth rather than raw force of arms or give larger groups more options for outpostsone other thing of note making something thats only discoverable  killable by metagaming means is not only a bad precedent to set but very unhealthy for any game
although mal is ok kaylee would be much better
indeed kaylee would be a much better choice but scotty needs to go
rather than make things more convinient to find it clutters and confuses
100 agreethis is just so stupid
speaking of mudslinging why you feel that you should put in the same pot the people using a iteron 5 with a mighty mining laser to mine while afk with the people using a macroyou do exactly what i described you bunch together people mining in a way you dont like with macrominers to give more appeal to your proposal your idea is to harass those that stay away from the keuyboard more than 5 minutes plain and simple
i went through the index pages and didnt find anything on thisit is a simple request  dont set a m3 limit to coureier contracts i cannot see what is the use of limiting courier contracts to 120k m3 as the cargo space set for ships will automatically control this when setting up a contract people will keep in mind that the smaller the volume of a single contract is the more characters are capable to haul the package and it is therefore more likely to be completed quickly on the otherhand setting a courier contract of 15 million m3 is basilcally useless as no ship can accomodate such volume as far as i knowrt
we tried to persuade ccp to remove it at the iceland meetinghowever i believe there was some database issues
we are going to need a ship moving courier type now as well using the orca sma for rigged ships
thanks for the feedback i can understand that programmingwise a limit might need to be set can at least this limit be increased to a more practicable levelrt
yes please
yeah i can support thatwe need ccp to look into that
what sort of issues is there any reason the limit couldnt be set to say 981250 m3 the maximum capacity of any cargo holdalso i like the bit about optimization of moving ships in courier contracts that can be a truly ugly process and itd be good to have streamlining exist for it
i like this idea generally speaking  so its just a matter of working out the specifics here are a couple of ideasfirst in order to avoid the situation that exists with moon mining lets make control of the assets more dynamic this cant be done militarily but it can be done economically control is given to the highest bidder with auctions weekly to determine control for the next week positive sideeffects include dynamically raising the cost of assets producing items that prove to be highvaluesecond add in the ability for hostile players to impact production remember all those npc trade ships that fly back and forth between stations well some of them are carrying your stuff from the planet to your office in the station if a pirate or hostile corporation catches one of the transports which will fly the owners flags and count as belonging to the owning corp for purposes of concord andor wars they can destroy or capture a portion of your production make it so these transports run once per day carry a days worth of product and run at a time specified by the owner at least a day in advance
you shouldnt have picked achuraif you dont like it biomass your char
so you would suggest that people delete characters that are several years old because the avatar they get with ambulation isnt one they like even when they had no idea that ambulation was even going to exist when they made their character even when the only reason they dont like the avatar is because of decisions ccp made after they created the character if this was about character portraits you would have a point because all the information about the appearance was there in the character creation menu but even now we dont know what limitations our avatars will have so how do you know that you wont hate your available avatar options when ambulation is released how will you feel if you find that achuras get all the good looking avatars while your stuck with the ugly ones will you be willing to delete your main character if that happens 
no because i think ambulation is a gimmick
no if anything make ambulation not mandatory some of us dont want to see anything but ships no peoples
actually itd be nice if we are able to spruce up our wardrobe when ambulation hits for those whacky rpers who do things like play caldari achura expats who want to dress like a foppish gallenteplastic surgery should be right out maybe they should let you muck with your face decorations get a new piercing but thats the most you choose that face when ya started even if its a face only a mother could love thats more than most people getqft this is irrelevent this is internet spaceships not world of world of warcraft
wow elf lover spotted
op has my sympathy i think everyone should get to redo the character appearance screen note not pick new bloodline or we as i for one want to put a hood over my ugly mush before venturing out in public 
votefuggly achuras 
im a sexy beast the ladies love me and i cant wait for ambulation too bad you picked an achura male not signed
how do you know that your characters body structure will look better than mine when all you have gotten to see so far is your characters face so you would prefer that everyone is stuck with a decision they made based before they knew about ambulation even when you could be screwed over by changes that ccp decide to make later which would serve you better1  limiting everyones choice of avatars to ones from your current bloodline andor gender2  letting everyone change their characters bloodline and gender once then forcing the limitation on themespecially when the initial creation of our avatars will involve a lot of customisation
i like the basic idea of making the construction skills more meaningful but i think that a time reduction has a fairly low effect on most t1 producers and a sizeable boost to t2 producers since t2 production already requires the skills to be trained it results in up to 33 improvement in profittime for t2 producersinstead id propose a small reduction in material cost for production perhaps around a half percent maybe a full percent per level this would have a fairly negligible impact on market prices overall and would offer little benefit to traditionally highprofit production fields but for the more competitive fields such as t1 ship production it would give a noticable benefit to dedicated producers over casual buildersfor example if an item can normally be sold at a 10 profit decreasing build costs by 25 at level 5 would increase profit margins by 25 less a slight reduction due to competition driving the market price downedit to add support
sup supa dawg say sup sup in
i think i just lost 2 minutes of my lifecan i have my 2 minutes back
the basic argument is always the same because there are three slots ccp must enable simultaneous training what will be next simultaneous training for jump clones  just because they are therei am not even sure whether there are valid pro and con arguments at all in this discussion the game is such by design think about it this way you put your soul into a character slot hence only one is active the other one is in stasis maybe the word game is wrong in this context to start with this is virtual realitymultipayers get multi accounts ok true advantagedisadvantage of the char market now if you want to play this game then play it from the beginning bringing the char market into a discussion which is supposed to be taken serious is a  adversarial move who wants to buy a char anyway
partially agreei would be happy to pay a little more to train at least one of the 2 remaining characters at half speedor with something like1495 train 1st character at full speed2245 train 1st character at full speed and a second at 12 speed2990 train 1st character at full speed and the other 2 at half speed
i support this but it needs more limitations a noob buying a battleship after 14 days for lent money while not having any ways of generating this back will be unwanted but as always eve is a scifi mmo with prehistoric technology p
i was really hesitant when it looked like it was going to cost the 1bil in skill books the rorq did when you made it a capitalit looks to be a dream ship since it is a joint developement will both ore and deep core sell the bpo so it wont require going to 00 to pick up a bpjust about perfect to me
here here and from the looks of it this expansion pack has even more lovin in store for us industrialists a genuine thanks to all at ccp for their work
yup npc corps shouldnt be hideout from wardecs i did not think much about that but there are ways to solve this issue
as much work as hes doing lvv should be getting paid for this p
tip of the day 2second day after the candidates being notified about the result of our applications i thought it maybe was a good idea to include 2 tips today because its weekendits obviously my second campaign now i think its important to look in the history books why dont you take a look as well to find our moreyou can find my first campaign thread right hereim very passionate about the economy of eve i wrote a large essay about what i thought about eves economythe first issue can be found herethe second issue can be found herei also wrote a 6 page long article as an introduction for people into the economy and industrymainly the market in eon 13 i recommend getting hold of eon 13 its a quality magazine

hows a dawg plan to addres a thing called recyclin
please explain how crane and nighthawk powergrid and precision heavy missiles are not boost my ship but rather a larger fairness issue because they sure look like the other boost my ship issues you left off of your list
in those cases a lot of the support came from people who didnt fly the ship in question thats not an unerring guide but its a sign that something may in fact be wrong

issler dainze  csm candidate  let me be your voice when you scream in spacei thought id take a moment to talk about how i think the csm needs to conduct itself and what the csm should attempt to accomplishfirst the council needs to conduct its business in a mature and orderly manner meetings need to be managed professionally and with some sort of rules of order members that choose to be disruptive disrespectful or unable to operate under those rules of order should be subject to escalating sanctions from the csm directly i dont expect this to be a problem but i have been involved in enough groups to know that sometimes keeping activities focused and productive can be a challengethe council must agree to operate with complete transparency meetings minutes should be available to all eve pilots without edit or censora process should be put in place that allows the eve pilots to raise issues for consideration by the csm the process should allow the pilots to see the current status of any issue formally raised for consideration by the csm if votes are involved the votes of each csm member should be made availble for all eve pilots to review if an issue is dismissed at some point in the process the dismissal should be made public with the ultimate justification of the actions if the csm decides to pursue the issue the pilots of eve should be made aware of the csms intentions for further action whenever possible within the limits of ccp emposed ndas the csm should attempt to make ccps reactions to recomendations clear to the the pilots of evecsm members must be accountable i would propose that once an issue has been raised to the csm by the pilots of eve that it is given an owner within the csm this csm member will be responsible for sheparding the issue though the process the csm member would be expected to become the expert for the issue within the csm they would become the primary contact point for the csm with regards to the issuethe csm must demonstrate sensitivity to the issues facing ccp as well it is not acceptable to just say something is wrong and demand it be fixed the csm must also provide suggestions for how issues might be resolved based in the councils discussions as well as feedback provided by the pilots of eve the csm should only present an issue to ccp when it has been thoroughly investigated and it is well understood by the csm the csms effectiveness will be dramatically improved if they prove to be credible to ccp there is a terribly overused term in my professional life that i will use here the csm must add value to the process of providing eve pilot feedback to ccpfinally the csm needs to keep in mind this is all supposed to be fun thats not to say that you cant be serious about your fun but that it needs to not become combative personal or so involved that no one can possibly suceed id also hope everyone in the csm approaches their involvement with the best intentions the csm cannot be allowed to become a metagaming element in eveso i hope that helps everyone get a sense of what i think the practicalities of the csm should be likeenough for now and rememberstuffs getting better stuffs getting better everyday issler dainzecsm candidateceo tadakastu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord
you got my votes last time i think youll get them againwhats your analysis of the first csmwhat do you think you could have done differently
thank youa lot of what the first csm did isnt going to be apparent due to both the nda and the design cycle that ccp works with so its hard to say they had a lot of problems early dealing dealing with a lack of organization and a few people who didnt feel like adjudicating the rules fair and evenly that and the animosity it created clouded the rest of the sessionbut even then it seems that a number of decent things got sent to cccp and a number of very bad things got shot down however whatever the final tally is i will reserve my judgment for when ccp releases any informationget elected editactually i have something to say regarding part of that over on shc there was a lot of talk about ccps design cycle and how that impacts small balance changes i would push for ccp to create a team directly responsible for understanding and making small changes that dont require overall approvaleg locus rigs not stacking properly was a bug that had persisted for nearly a year after its discovery there is no reason that that should have taken a year to get fixed another example is the shieldarmor hit points of the typhoon the phoon should have more armor than shield its an armor tanker changing that doesnt require a 6 month design cycle it requires someone to be in charge of fixing small things with the gumption to make sure it gets done
hello allas said in my application text i am a simple pragmatic person i candidate to push as hard as as i can for the existing features to work as intended by pushing on important subjects the community feelscsm goal in my opinion should is to try to give proper feedback from the community and act as an idea farm not to sit in whatever pixelated glorymy goal is to help as much as i can to make eve a better game with the current features it is supposed to providethe current main issues i see per subject thatll be my wall of text for now p00  server infrastructure can not hold the fleetsblob warfare should not be the end of it all there are a lot of ideas around to overcome thisfind a way to promote small nonnano warfare instead of the current blobfest fleet battles blast damage for example is one of the ideas thats on many threads there are othersall those ideas are over forum are bring good debates each timegeneral pvp  pvp happens in too few locations gates poses stations there again are a lot of ideas around to promote a less centralized pvp fields00 market  make market a station service like it is supposed to be add more filters unlike what it is now a neutral in space should require market access to buy things contract mechanics do not have the flexibility of marketindustry  outpost industry is now pointless taking over an outpost is way faster than building itnpc seeded market breaks the idea of an open player driven marketrelated to corp industry  create mechanism that make it easy for people to contribute to a corp production chain which right now requires too much out of game toolsout of game  hire a damn webmaster make a script to prevent npc alts to post on caod edit  apparently this is a solved issue now i didnt checkout of game  checking account alts is easy via api keys a lot of corporations and groups are then relying on out of the game tools to ensure their corp security this should be included ingame directly basically let directors see your altscorporation management  the tools provided to directors are way too limited unlimited divisional wallets this area should be totally revamped its close to unusabledevsccpcommunity interaction  there is a real lack of live events many small to middle sized events could be organized even by isd to make the space less mechanic and more alivebasically the goal is to be biting ccps bottom with all due respect ofc by pointing right where the game does not work as intended once a subject is covered move to the nextthe community decides what means works as intended thats part of a sandbox definition right pthanks for readingsplag
eve is supposed to feel vast and empty it isnt supposed to feel alive
that is a point of view
i like these ideas the most interesting so far among the rabble of csmcandidates i also saw in game development forum that you will lobby for fixing blasters  autocannons for that you may have a vote from mecornette

well you have my vote being into industry and spending some time in low sec it seems we are compatable and you are the only one i know on the list
no pods go squize eggs go crack
good luck vily you have my vote
1 what is your view on this topiclinkage2 what is your view on the dd
1 the poster for minmatar capitals make some valid points but makes some invalid ones as wellhe assumes that minmatar capitals must shield tank and basis his assumptions on that thesis however that thesis is not wholeheartedly necessary minmatar capitals can armor tank and almost all standard fleet dreadnaughts do just that because of the limitations that he lists to stop that limitation and allow the versatility that minmatar capital pilots train for i would suggest we adopt his recommendations for addition cpu i would also agree that the hardpoint slots would be done for a change 33 personally would seem to me to be a much more interesting pitch with still split damage bonuses to prevent it from being overpoweredslotwise you cannot grant extra slots without overpowering a ship so if he wants to extra mids in favor of a lost high and low slot then i could agree with that but not with a positive slot gain however i dont like it i personally think it would just create a pheonix copy with projectile weapons howeverthe solution i think would work best is a low slot traded for a midslot 33 turretmissile hardpoints the naglfars projectile bonuses reduced to 5 and a 10 increase in shield and a 10 decrease in armor accompained by a large cpu boostas to the nidhoggur cpu yes although this means you must boost the chimera as well then as well at most you can boost the nidhoggurs capacitor by 5improving the bonus no its already a useful bonus when usedi read through the thread and while alot of pilots seem in favour of it it does not work well for overall game balance to drastically improve one carrier without doing so to the others so a pair of minor upgrades i can agree with but others no2 its overpowered and overused titans as i watch every day dictate the combat we engage in on or off the field im not sure what the exact solution is but there is definetly something wrong
ah so im not the only canadian in the race you win the geese ill take the moose and well have more than enough votes on the csm to make concord wear mountie hats

just thought i would beef up my responceive known prom a little over 25 years from my first move into lowsec in the game him and his corp where very helpful ive had lots of ts chats with prom in my eve lifehe is very mature and has a strong passion for the game he is very well versed in all areas from carebearing to pew pewingjac aka pabs owned and flew as pabs sco until sold
prom has my vote he is simply too damned sexy not to vote for him 3
after flying along side you for more time than i would ever admit or want to calculate i have to post on this threadwe have seen so much in eve together and been apart of some of the most amazing times in and out of war zonesyour manner of communication is with out flaws and your calm and easy going nature esures others that you do indedd mean every word you sayi vote for you for many reasons but non other than as a long time eve player i trust in your judgment and i would hope you can carry thru your promise to take the minds of the eve players to the top and voice our problemsgo for it prom there is no better man for the job
they prefer the term third party supporters point conceded howeverwhen i stated that i appeared to be doing it wrong i did not mean to imply that my policy on in game story moving to punish the caldari for their actions both in the novel and chronicles is not without merit however i merely noticed after browsing the other candidates that most if not all had presented personal policies and statements of intent and felt that if anyone at all was to going to take my running in the election as anything other than a joke i needed to clarify that i do indeed have in my own eyes at least some merit as a candidatei could extend that into a few paragraphs for the wall of text vote but its a little early to be selling out just yet i wish you and all others running a good and possibly fun campaignboosh
dear arithron you spent several hours searching that cold dark system for my corpse for that you will get my vote anyone who wants to be a csm dear god why the  would anyone want to be a csm as bad as arithron will do their best i support this guy in his quest to be a csm on top of that hes not a  like most of the other people hes going up against anyone who knows me knows that i am a real sourpuss so when you hear a positive tone coming from me then you know its goodarithron 2008
absolutely  the generation of the raw resources would have to be kept up ccp couldnt get rid of macromining completely  but i would try to make it more difficult by putting some additional risks in the game to balance the reward being gained  for example lets say two people from different corpsfleets were mining the same roid when it got depleted  give the possibility of a 15 minute agro between the miners involved perhaps based on the quantitytype of asteroid being mined  another option might be to create npcminers that do the mining adding possible twists the npcs could perhaps be attacked given the the right set of circumstances and having the npc mined materials put up on the market  i agree with your point on the impact of removing macromining  not many people enjoy mining for 12hour stretches of time but presently having that scale of mining going on is playing a key role in the manufacture of items  are there many macrominers here that could comment id like to get another perspective
what why is a mailing list bad for discussion that strains credulity on the surface and you are a bright guy so i dont understand what i am missing herethx
the problem is that a mailing list is hard to keep track of the ability to quote and things like that is kinda hardits also easier for the public to keep track of discussion of a forum the community is already used to reading the forum we have right here we gotta bring the discussion right to the community imodoes that make sense edit thanks to arithron for pointing out the error i made which made my whole post extremely contradicting
didnt you mean to say that its much harder for the public to keep track of discussion via a mailing listcommunication and discussion with players is of paramount importance for the csm ill be seeking alternate ways to engage the playerbase if i get onto the csm one idea would be an listed ingame channel that shows in all regions etc called csm discussion or somesuch csm members can thus interact with players and answer questions etc of course it will hinge on csm members using the channel rather than closing the channel as happens now with the csm one i often see csm logged or logging in but not in channeltake carearithron
sorry yes that was a slip on my it was supposed to say  of a forum
hi boss will be sad lost you as our ceo if you win this election but entire community will win a great rep to issue their voiceyou have a great passion for this game and you will be a excellent csm repwe play together in last 3 years and in this time i have chance to know you better as a player and as a person and im happy that i can call you my friendthan you can count with my 6 votes stromgren
just saw the full list of csm candidates and something is obviously missing here the enter key i submitted a fairly short message but it still looks kind of silly when you remove the line break halfway through when you look at a message like arithrons ankhasentapemkahs or god forbid kesper norths theyre absolutely unreadable id like to request that either ccp restore the formatting we submitted our messages with or failing that that they give us a chance to resubmit formatting for themthough without being allowed to change the content its painful enough for me to read i dont want to think about being a voter who had never heard of these people being faced down by undifferentiated walls of text in several of these candidates messages
there are some great possibilities that eve has in regard to improving the marketsystem  what would be especially interesting to me would be a causeandeffect relationship with some of the set npc trading  for example all those construction blocks going from point a to point b should at some point in time result in some effect  thoughts
geez  wrong forum  to quote one of the other candidates  i guess im doing it wrong  
although wait lets stop and turn this into something a electorial debate of the effects of govermental intervention the csmdevs in the free marketplace and proposed stances and positionsyou say there are some great possibilities that eve has in regard to improving the marketsystem but should improvements even be made in a marketplace that consists of players trading with each other surely any improvment is mearly an attempt at regulating that market imposing a possible impediment to free trade and slowing economic growthshould the possibilty even exist to introduce a non player driven effect within the marketcanditdates state your position
ive always assumed the movement of npc goods was mostly to support an equilibrium in the economy  theyre producing lego at a and using it at b so theyll pay you to move it now if you wanted to have npc orders be more dynamic i could get behind that but with the longterm price changes already based on how often a particular order gets filledor not i think they have the core of the system down right
what i had in mind was something more along the lines of some effect occuring as a result of the sale of npc goods over time  to use the construction block example lets say a huge number of block have been purchased on a regular basis by an npc corp how could that be reflected in the game  what i had in mind was perhaps a special complex would show up in system  or perhaps some special itemsships would become available from the loyalty point store there are surely other ideas on what kind of effects would make sense thoughtsthe aspect that i personally think would be cool is that trading or even lack of trading would have some sort of impact on another aspect of the gamequite a bit of thought would be needed in implementing something like this  i mean what is the result of a npc corp buying massive amounts of some of the colorful eveitems on the market for example spirits tobacco garbage  over time
a lot of them really arent used on anything like that kind of scale why would it be represented ingame that the npc ceo of an npc corporation is having a good week with his cigar suppliers spaceships arent built out of construction blocks or exotic dancers theyre built out of minerals if any of the trade goods were actually used for player purposes they wouldnt be trade goods theyd be playersourced with the exception of pos fuel and outpost components also the design time for what you propose would be pretty horrifying  designing a new widelyavailable ship requires a lot of design and balance work and designing as many as youd need for this initiative to actually work sensibly would take more manhours than ccp could conceivably put towards this this area of the economy really isnt broken  not everything in the eve universe is done by or for pod pilots  i see no need to fix it
wow as a candidate i have to say a read alot of good things about promithius and i say good luck if you do win we will have a very helpful csm right on prom
please keep the discussion in your original thread using reply to topic other than the new topic button
i see that most candidates are for the aliances or the corps i am for eve old first then the new my word is my bond it is the caldari way
all caldari take notice ee21k wants to bring caldari down by join all other races against us
hey no matter how i spell it you still got the messagewhen i was typing that i was killing a gallantian oh i think i spelled your race wrong you will not bring down the caldari but i like how you say it will take every race on your side to try what you guys cant do it alonehehe
there are those who would like to see eve a huge ram eating monster full of new fixes not me i would rather fix what we have working now there are those who want to make logging on to change skills avalible out side the game i say no way for the sake of fairness to those who have trained for years furthermore when your at work you should be working and at school you should be learning eve is a place we go to forget this world this game requires patients and forethoughtkeeping ccp out of our game is the only way to go they can handle the tec and we can run the game
think about that one for a few minutes i count 3 mistakes in that statement not including grammer capitalisation or punctuation

bad move ccp reverse it
ghost training always was a big annoyance to me as i felt like peeps that did it were cheating on me it promotes offline gaming and made characters a form of commodity to trade around that were build using free time it removes the eve experience of growing up and adapting all the wayghost training dead  good for every real eve player out theredo not even think of trying to counter this change there will be more players helped by discontinuing it then hurt
yes obv
troll spotted
id be more than happy with a twoskill queue that is primary and secondary that way i could train one inconvenient length skill per day while working on a long skill for example i could train a 6hour skill backed by a threeweek skill without having to wake up early to switch the skill before work
a queue suggests that we want different skills lined up in a queue so a player can get away for weeks at an end and still get his training done this suggestion is incomplete misleading even a queue can also be implicit for level 14 skills and apply only to the skill being trained that way people dont have to stay up loosing sleep just to micromanage level1  level 2  level 3  level 4 transitions of a skillthis is the major grief of not having a skill queue eve skill training dictating your life and body clock in order of not loosing ingame ability the real change that is needed that will not be exploitable and will not add complexity to the game but only a few lines of code is thison skill training completeif  level achieved  4  thenstart training next level of the skillthat is allif ccp finds this too much we can follow a scheme likeon skill training completeif  level achieved  5  then start 48h timer and auto assume player wants to start training on the next level of the skillon logon wipe timer and stay trainingon reaching 48h without logon abort training of skill player did not explicitly started it nor implicitly approved it by logging onelegance all over itit does solve the chores of changing skills always a plus worst thing that can happen to a player is that staining on the next level started while you might not have wanted it resulting in some unused skill points which is btw easily avoidable for people that log on regularlyso ccp no drawbacksnow get those hamsters to start working please why do i have to do all the thinking here
actually thats exactly what most of us wantbut well be marginally content with any lesser alternative too
support this issue  topic
heres all i want for xmas ccp a very simple requestplease allow me a simple 24 hour window to queue up my next desired skillthis would be so great because while i play a little throughout the week my work schedule often conflicts with optimal login time a simple 24 hour window to queue my next skill would make training so much more satisfying when i cant plan training to always end in the evening
yes please
please ccp make this dream come true
sounds like a good idea
i would have agreed if this was voting it is not it is merely a request for confirmation that there is a certain number of people who think the issue is important enough for the csm to discuss iti think a sizeable minority should be able to bring questions to the table thats why i will not support this
againstnanonerf is fail
used to be for it but its gone too far do not nerf blasters if ccp cant do this without making blasters even worse they shouldnt do it
i currently have 6 skills with 46 hours of training needed to either get to level 4 or level 5 that would have been trained 2 weeks ago if their was a skill queue

i am paying for my account if i cant log in for a week lots of military people have this problem and account sharing is an eula violation as long as the subrscription is current they should allow skills to be trained now after the last skill i set is active they would just cancel subscriptioni would likely never go more than a couple days because i would miss my ingame freinds and need to baby sit the market orders but that is a valid reason to log in
thats all good and fine but you really should be posting this in jita park not herei also dont see a reason to state the obviousassembly hall is a place to state ideas not rants coughcoughghosttrainingwhinerscoughcough
i think this is a veery good point even if posted in the wrong forum i believe there is some discussion about maybe having the skill queue issue raised again if it does i will make sure that this point is included
completely agree obviously
having no skill queue encourgages people to log in and play is a ridiculous idea anyone with a modicum of common sense can see thatwhat i think ccp might actually mean when they say that is no skill queue discourages people from running multiple accounts purely to raise characters theyre not going to play regardless i dont see that this is a good enough reason to inconvinience the rest of us nor is it even necessarily desirable to do so
exacty the point im trying to make and the reason why im pushing for a skill queue again even after ccp kinda dismissed itas if i somehow want to play eve at 4 in the morning comes homebrother heya want a drinkme yeah in a few minutes my skill ended training 15 minutes ago but my buss was late blahblahrushes upstairs to set another skillreally good gaming experience eh
i agree with the op but there is more so read oni understand ccps argument against skill queues but they are missing something a queue suggests that we want different skills lined up in a queue so a player can get away for weeks at an end and still get his training donethis suggestion is incomplete misleading even a queue can also be implicit for level 14 skills and apply only to the skill being trained that way people dont have to stay up loosing sleep just to micromanage level1  level 2  level 3  level 4 transitions of a skillthis is the major grief of not having a skill queue eve skill training dictating your life and body clock in order of not loosing ingame ability the real change that is needed that will not be exploitable and will not add complexity to the game but only a few lines of code is thison skill training complete if  level achieved  4  then start training next level of the skillthat is allno more no less and you will end this discussion once and for all and everyone will be happy
my opinion exactly just because i log in to change a skill before i head to class doesnt mean i suddenly change my mind after logging in and decide to spend 2 hours doing missionspeople log in to play the game switching skills is just a chore
 and cumbersome bothering etc

1when i took a break from eve  the first question i asked when i resubscribed was so when is the next pvp tourney
ofc support
supported    ive been looking for my chance in this for a long time
one adjustment would be to go through the ships that the database shows as your typical mwd blaster ships thorax and megathron and add bonuses to afterburners tracking speed and possibly stasis webs or max velocity this is what i was hoping would happen to the thoraxs mwd bonus as from what i understand ccp wants to see more afterburners used in combat
i wish to add that blasters need to be generally looked at but at the very least now that webs will not be onoff weapons they need to have their tracking increased so that blasterships have about the same chance to hit at their optimal engagement distance say optimal  falloff like pulses and autocannons just so that people can use their guns pretty much fairly that would take what 50 tracking doubling whatever yes they are that problematicah yes found it a heavy pulse laser has 16 km optimal  falloff and 008 tracking a heavy neutron blaster has 8600 km optimal  falloff and 010 tracking it should be more like 008 tracking for pulse 016 tracking for blasters and thats the bare minimumand then the whole i can not approach fast enough so i die idea needs consideration but blaster tracking should be way way higher just because of their smaller range otherwise they will simply not be usable without the web to freeze the target
i think this is a very interesting idea perhaps one way to connect this to the small scale gangs idea is to make an explicit role for the black ops shipperhaps the ministructure could be cloaked as described but for it to hide vessels a black ops ship with a specialized gang module would be needed such a set up could create another way to reveal the hidden ships take out the black ops ship rather than relaying only on metagaming
i like the idea of the invading armada as long as players can fight and have a chance of destroying the armada and looting salvage ect
that idea in the op would be too easily exploited come on man you know how high sec pirates operate do you really want to have to answer challenges from 30 kiddie pirates every 10 secondsa simpler idea would be to just have a 4digit randomly generated docking code that is flashed on your screen that you have to type in before you dock in highsec stations only but the code will be in irregular print stretchedwarped numbers similar to those seen on forums to prevent anonymous spamming this would make it impossible for a bot to redock effectively killing their income granted they dont have a pos in the systemi really wouldnt mind punching in a code if it meant i wouldnt have to compete with macro miners
they need to put some basic macro tools in the game and just get over it already why would any sane person want to actively mineoh god too many people will log on and afk mine all daymake the macro tools only work in low sec or zero zero and take all the premium grades of the ore types out of high sec
supporting rp wise my char is halfbrutor i want some warpaint and a mohawk under this hood
wanted to have carpy looking achura so you will have it d
naww i dont think so
didnt the devs add in an avatar swap featurefor all we know when they roll out the patch we might get a 2nd change to change the cosmetics of our characters appearance
i was reading the thread on the upcoming orca and was noticing the nerd rage over it requiring mining barge v when it isnt even really a mining vessel its an over glorified subcap sized t1 command ship the rational im assuming is that it is an ore subcap and like the other caps and subcaps it requires the underlying racial skill at level vmining barges always took me as being weird ships everything else either had their own race specific ship skill raven  caldari battleship ii or required a race specific ship skill in addition to the skill for that ship class myrmidon  battlecruiser ii  gallente cruiser iii mining barges and their skill stand alone it is effectively a racial ship skill now that ore produces more than barges and they all require the barge skill despite not being barges back when ore only produced mining barges the skill name worked well but if ccp keeps giving us goodies from ore the name should reflect what the skill really does nowadays lets you fly ore shipsso my suggestion rename the mining barge skill something like ore mining and survey vessel or even simply ore industrialpreemptive reply now that ive wasted a minute of your life that youre never getting back i return you to your regularly scheduled eve
hi representativessomeone there is complaining about closed threads without reason and the result was that his thread got closed by ccpthat sounds like some kind of censoreship to me with the history of ccp they should not do that please investigate andor ask ccpregardseve g
lol your next
csm has no influence over the community team nor their actionsif you have any concern about moderation please let the moderators know at modsccpgamescom
no skill that reduces mineral consumption by any significant amount is allowable i get perfect refine and as soon as someone else getting perfect build we get a super hi pe and print isk enough people doing it ruins the economythat said few people would be affected by reduction in time to a significant degreemaybe use it to increase the chances of invention lower the damage per run on t2 stuff like ram electronics or such i do agree their needs to be a usei also dislike advanced spaceship command you need it to 1 for a freighter and 5 for everything else it is like ccp just wants an extra month subscribed before you get to capitals
im sure that t2 producers across eve would cry out for joy if ccp chose to add an extra multiplier to t2 profit per time 2533 more income at skill 45 per the ops suggestion would be excellent for their bottom line but i also dont think that would be fair especially since the skill is required to produce t2 in the first place i think its fair to say that most people dont believe the profits from t2 production are too little at the same time i think that the majority of say battleshipbattlecruiser production is done from 13 run bpcs set up as an afk job and this time reduction would have no meaningful impact for themits far too easy to get perfect construction having an additional skill that improves efficiency by a tiny amount such as 05 per level would be good to grant a slight edge toward those who specialize without becoming a requirement for entry as production efficiency is
ive petitiones myself the fact that players join fw militia and together with pirates shoot blues in one such of case fc give the order to shoot that blue that was spying and working together with pirates as a result i lost faction standing from 87 to 67 problem is that we cant defend ourself from these ppl and we only lose the fun and isk and ccp respond me in their normal wayhi thank you for your patience i discussed this with my colleagues and we regret to inform you that spy is allowed in faction warfare and if you shoot the spy you will have to suffer from the standing loss this is but the intended game mechanic im sorry about the inconvenience this has caused if you have any further questions please feel free to let me know thank you best regards gm jericho eve online customer support
as a test server player i watch for bad ideas and i have seen a monster of a bad idea on the test server at this time explosion velocity of all missiles have been cut to 110 of what they are now what this means and we have tested it is that 5 ravens with t2 precision missiles cannot hit a rifter with an afterburner running if ccp goes with this nerf u had better sell your raven for scrap and train rails asapthe nano nerf u have dreamed of is even worse warp disruptors kill mwd and all ships take 50 longer to accel to top speed kiss your mwd blasterthon goodbye and good luck getting out of a bubbleit all boils down to one more gallentecaldari nerfcheck here if u want to take the nerfbat away
isnt there an entire forum for posting about changes on the test server
fail there is a new missile damage formula in development old stats and new stats cannot be compared read the freaking forum
they are testing missiles at the moment this is not a final product i hope
as discussed last night over too much alcohol hereby the request to give us an order api instead of letting us do it manually through the walletordersexport button and then copy paste out of the file generatedthis will save me personally alot of time as it will do for manybtw i checked and as some said it isnt made yet
im sorry but whats the purpose of an order api
sounds a whole lot like the market orders api we already have
what the purpose is what is the purpose of the order export button rightthanx vista ill look into it  it wasnt on the eveo documentation page
please answer the following questions in detailwhat do you believe csm should achieve as an entity do you believe the previous session did thathow do you feel about the current speedchange and its effect on guerrilla warfare specificallyif you value things like integrity and trust how do you feel about things like corptheft and scamming in evehow do you feel about hisec gankingwhat are your views on  the developer misconduct and internal affairsdo you think that eve has in any way diminished in the cold dark universe aspect in the last five years and if so is that a bad thing
actually i want to know too since there is allot of that going on i think
i would welcome any change to the current bounty system since right now its pointless to say the least fw also needs more depth to it
also endorsing this candidate
endorsing this candidate aswell
awesome to hear your viewpoints vukgood to see people who agree local if removed needs another good information gather toolcomplete reworking of scanning systembut imo why fix something that isnt broken in the end ccp usually farks it up anywaysbut yah support this guy
i know these questions werent asked specifically of me but they were asked in enough candidate threads that i figured i should throw in my two cents the csm seems to me to be as much as anything a way of formalizing developerplayer interactions forum chatter is limited in usefulness because it overemphasizes the vocal minority and ccp wants something better the csm should be a way of filtering out bad ideas developing good ideas and conveying them to ccp in as usable a form as possible the first incarnation of the csm did a fairly good job of this but theres certainly room for improvement there needs to be a better big picture view of what topics the csm raises rather than the pet projects of eight players and whatever looks good to a ninth there needs to be some thinking about what the csm wants to say on a topic rather than just taking a thread and passing it along and there needs to be better communication with players to ensure that they are on the same page too i constitutionally dislike nerfs  they seem like proof of bad design to me balance in a complex game is best achieved via an interlocking series of countermeasures to tactics strategies working contrary to each other and so on not by tweaking numbers you may have to tweak numbers to make an individual item properly balanced within a tactic the prebuff apocalypse contributed nothing to the game for example because it did the same task as the armageddon and the abaddon but worse but id rather provide a countermeasure to an overpowered tactic than making the tactic worse let players achieve balance through a vibrant metagame dont use the nerfbat to do it as for guerrilla warfare the problem seems to be less with the ships used to do it as it is with the lack of targets a proper guerrilla force uses flexibility to hit inadequately defended targets of value and to flee before their opponents can reactsince if they waited theyd lose the ensuing setpiece battle theres a lot of ways of doing this at present and even after the nano nerf comes in thered still be a lot  you may flee slower but your pursuers are slower too the problem is what can you do to an enemy system while your gang is in it that would matter there might be one ratter and if youre really lucky a few ships in a mining gang and all of them will cloak flee or log before you can reasonably come to grips with them you break their rat chains and go home having slowed one players income gathering for an hour no roaming gang has the firepower to break down the infrastructure that exists asis or else its big enough to be courting battle instead of fleeing it and you cant hit his mobile assets unless he wants you to if you want guerrilla warfare to be plausible you need to either make it possible to use guerrilla tactics to fight pos battles or you need to make something smaller than a pos and less mobile than a ship thats still worth destroying i value integrity in a person because not everybody has it my contract history is littered with onesided contracts because i trusted the other person to do what they said they would do when i dont trust them i doublecheck everything and only complete things i can verify and i certainly dont give them access to my corporations wealth there should be better features for tracking and security settings especially inside corps theres a lot of problems with the corp management system asis but the concept of scamming is fine
it should be possible to gank in hisec  im a believer in the philosophies of concord provides consequences not protection and by clicking undock you accept the possibility of pvp i dont think it should be especially easy to do it profitably and well and i like the recent changes to security penaltiestriple the baseline and multiply it by system sec for those who dont know but it should be possible not to put too fine a point on it but ccp screwed the pooch not only did they blow their public relationsseriously can you think of a single dumber move than permabanning a whistleblower and doing it publicly after hes made the whole community aware of what happened but they also shook the confidence of their player base badly they should have fired t20 instantly and very publicly upon verification of what had happened  and no facesaving resignation either but an outright firing their and make sure it never happens again part wasnt so bad since it was both quickly implemented and seems to have actually been done fairly well but their response to the initial problem was completely wrong and yes they should reinstate kugu probably give him a free couple years of training while theyre at it to make up for what they deprived him of for that matter giving him a job at internal affairs is a tempting idea  when youve got a credibility problem who better to hit up than the guy who just finished raking you over the coals for your very real failings of course all this should have happened when the problem first came to ccps attention not a year and a half later but its a bit late for that a little bit but for very good reasons part of the cold and dark nature of eve in the early days was that the universe was fundamentally empty there was no infrastructure there were no players and there was no documentationfrom the developers or the community because of that everything was fresh and unknown and exciting since then the player base has expanded massively by a factor of 8 i think the number was pretty much everything is explained if you look theres an outpost in every tenth system in 00 and theres support nets for everybody old and new of course space is going to feel less cold and dark when you can have 1400 in local in some ways i regret the loss of the aesthetic even though i wasnt there to see the early days it sounds like it was an exciting time even if the program was even more likely to lead to pulling out ones own hair then than it is now but the aesthetic isnt gone even if it has receded a little and the compensation is a better game with more players and thats welcoming to newbieswho despite the inevitable ribbing we give them really are necessary i consider that a fully worthwhile trade

i think the csms main objective is to let ccp know which issues are the most important to the community the existence reason of the council is that most player ideas dwell in the forums surrounded by big piles of garbage and forum trolls ccp does not have the manpower  intention to creep through all of it so here we are csm do the work for free figure out what people want and discuss it with them besides it is possible to make a discussion with 9 people it is impossible to make a discussion with 200000 people csms job is also to filter out the garbage as the council is an ongoing project the goals outlined here are not something you can completely achieve i think the council during the first cycle did however follow these goals if you ask me if the councils operation had any actual effect on eve that is another question the council sure did hell a lot of work a few menmonth for sure but as far as i can see none of the issues passed through have made it into patch notes yet so we have no measurable achievements yet i am curious myself when the fixes and features requested will hit the game unfortunately the csm cannot control that speed has been nerfed several times so far the speed change that is about to be implemented is just one more in the line remember the time when they changed the nanofibers or when they removed the possibility to fit multiple mwds on a ship those speed nerfs were hitting quite a lot of ships a lot harder than the upcoming one all those nanomachs nanophoons nanodomis and nanoravens are gone thanks god anyways as you may have learned i am a matar pilot i am concerned about the speed nerf as it not only affects the game style i am trying to represent but it will literally transform most of my hangars into a collection of minmatar garbage my corp is also full of minmatar pilots i fly nothing but minmatar so i have good reason to be antispeednerf but i am not why because i believe ccp does actually know quite a lot about what they its doing i firmly believe that they want to make the game better and not worse by introducting this change ccp likes 00 and they must also like roaming and guerilla level warfare as with all their employees together they still cant make a decent blob where they could test this stuff  so they surely test it on smaller scale  do you remember the gun nerf old times when an 1400mm howi whacked your ceptor orbiting it at 500m when signature radiusses did not matter at all or do you remember the missile nerf where the missiles stopped doing full damage on whatever target they could catch there was a big turmoil on the forums back then but in the end the game got better more balanced i think the same will happen with the speed nerf i think people will still keep flying nanoships why because right now nano ships have two important abilities 1 they can use their speed to tank stuff while they kill stuff2 they can use their speed to get out of disadvantageous situationsnanos are great in fleeing from battle thats why roaming and guerilla gangs use them to get quickly in and out of combat gank whatever comes flee if reinforcements arrive and i believe the nano nerf might kill point 1 solo pwnmobile but point 2 will remain nanoships will still be able to disengage and as we are talking about nanogangs we talk about multiple ships so taking out gankable stuff will still not be a problem the guys however who used to fly around alone in their vagas and kill whatever they find no matter if bs frig or command ship well they will be screwed screwed they will need gangmates or another ship i hope they will overcome this trauma somehow
i value integrity and trust and i think corp theft and scamming are morally wrong but i do not see a reason why they should be removed from the game i think that ccp should do everything to prevent the type of scams which are based on the visual and textual similarities of two items  forms because these are clearly the resulted by the weakness of the ui however i think that scams which require effort and intelligence like pyramid games and investment banks and players exploiting the trust of others should remain legit these are not nice things to do i would feel bad if my son did things like that but i think they are things that make eve specialas someone who has first hand experience in this field i am pretty happy that it has been made more difficult because there were so many people doing it that the minimal value of the ship they needed to start shooting went down so far that it was not really worth spending time on it any more at least thats why i stopped it i mean when some noobs tried to gank my hauler for some 80 mil of loot that was pretty pathetic i hope in light of the recent changes this profession will lose a lot of its popularity haulers will feel safe start hauling more and more valuable stuff using autopilot and i can get back into my mega and make some money i do not know much about  i have been reading his forums when he first started posting stuff from internal alliance forums i found it quite funny every alliance should make sure to keep their internal stuff protected as for the developer misconduct well i was quite of outraged when i first heard about them i still am a little bit actually but feelings fade with time anyways i think that the developer misconduct was completely unacceptable should never be allowed again to happen because they are very bad for the game can you clarify this question a little bit
my candidationas there is so much to read for you from all candidates ill try to stay brief as possible and give a clear explanation why i got triggered to take part of the 2nd councili want this project csm to become a successlead in i seen a lot of ideas from all dedicated people who love playing this game but ask yourselves this will 9 people with just good ideas be capable to get the job done the answer is noput 9 muppets together and you get the muppetshow not a councilwho is extremeim a high profile player in eve and created my corporation eye of god more than 5 years agoi started playing eve since beta and my specialties are that i can setup and lead projects communicate with my members and satisfy them in their in game needs create plans and execute these eye of god solely builded 3 outposts in eve we lost these during war but are still proud that we have achieved to have these builded as a teami am very talented in analyzing structures problems and create solutions a team buildermy goals for the 2nd council1 i want to build a true team with the next group of councilorswithout a good team all your ideas and input will fail 2a i want to prevent elite forming within the councilthis whole csm project will collapse if we accept the  hey we were already in the first council and thus we do things our way 2b create guidelines for future councilsin order to prevent failure of future councils i like to create guidelines that in the end can be adopted by ccp kind of constitutional lawsfinal wordsi do have some ideas but these are more on ceo  alliance leadership levelfor instance at ccpeve in las vegas we had eog vapour all the way from costa rica to ask ccp about an improvement of the mail system no need to get into detail here were 2 or 3 years later and the mail system is still like it was since 4 years agoas a csm i can accept a no from ccp concerning representing your ideas but i do want to know the reasons why from ccp and then will give the eve players community feedback with an explanation why a vote for me is a vote for the team a vote to successi really need all your votes
at this point we as the eveonline gaming public are aware that the csm reps didnt really do anything other than argue in chatrooms over bureaucratic issues what assurances do we have that you can navigate this nightmare of red tape to do what needs to be done whatever that happens to be or barring the ability to actually achieve anything that you can use your formidable powers to annoy the other members
what do you feel are the three most important things you can get done as a csmnb  i see you posted a platform can you be more specific as in specific and concrete proposals

my views which are i think the oens the ccp are coming to terms with are that they designed 1 racial version of each as a happy compromise between all the tasks youd need a capital ship to undertake and that if you could go back in time designing 23 different types of carrier within the same tier as well as 2 types of dreadnoughts would been the way to gocarrierstransportship mover weaker defence capabilities less hp less slots but able to carry 56 battleships at eg 10 ly base jump range jump range ship bonuseslogistics carrier remote rep orientated less fighterdrone damage greater cap recharge fewer high slots hp and cap related bonusesbattle carrier 78 high slots thanatos style dronefighter bonuses shorter jump range cargobay and ship maint baydreadsdefensive dread more hpslots shorter jump range stront use reduction bonusesattack dread greater jump range less hpslots and endurancei could understand the earlier idea of a carrier nerf however it would have been unacceptable without the addition of a new 2nd tier of capital ships resembling the followingthere either underwhelming or overpowered its coming to the point where most 00 alliances have mothership fleets which are just essentially better carriers where as the titan really doesnt provide the type of mobile base you would expect it to function as as long as they can be killed i dont imagine them to be game breaking although there prevailance throughout 00 suggests a lack of tactical alternatives more than anything elseunintuitive monotonous tactically bankrupt and would require a rethink into the whole idea of sovereignty what it means and what its benefits should be for instance you beat alliances by taking there space the truth is moral falls and an alliance collapses from within poss and sov are only the lightening rods for this to happen this shouldnt be the case or at least the only way of having this happen and i believe the answer would probably revolv around new victory conditions for war delcarationsalso at the moment the current sov mechanics encourages alliances to hold vast amounts of space this isnt helped by the extreme deficiency of resources per system 2 people could effectively maximise the entire resources of a solar system without an npc station vastly increasing the resources per system and increasing the variety of niches in which entities can exist corporations should be able to anchor bases within a multitude of places within solar the solar system all feeding towards a central sov generating structure at the systems stari dont mind them personally although i would like counters mobile jump bridge jammers t2 tier 2 battlecruiser for instance so you could for a limit time give yourself some cover from lee blobthey should be hackable covert ops  20  no shield otherwise there ok
clarc has my support
communicationand the fact that the the ccp is failing to publish there accomplishments in any meaning full or detailed way is a massive failureas a csm my responsibility would be to act as a reporter first making sure the eve community understands what the ccp is up to and detailing and publishing my reports on my blog this process has already begunthe speed changes are a band aid on a much more serious hit mechanic problem and that small gang pvp is really more related to motivations and mentalities read the rest hereessentially if more people are in smaller groups looking for smaller groups to fight because they have an insentive to combined with the fact that the outcome is less predictable then small gang warfare should naturally increaseill try and answer the other questions soon
hello excorpie vrun through your ideas on asteroid belts for me in addition perhaps you could throw your ideas on small gang pvp into the mix as they seem to be interlinked at least from reading your blogyour thoughts on eve lore too and what youd change if you would make any what about player interaction in the prime fiction by which i mean would you allow players to have an impact upon it and in what way

what do you believe csm should achieve as an entity do you believe the previous session did thatthe csm is branded as the council of stellar management its objective is and has been very open personally i see the csm for just what they are elected officials they are there to represent their consituants the players who voted them in based on the views and opinions as an entity they should bring issues forward and push for solutions the gms delevopers and people within ccp dont play this game to the extent degree or in the same way that we do and thus can loose perspective rather easily on the simple things that can be such an incredibly important aspect of gameplay as independent of ccp the csm can take a hardline and express things that ccp as a business may not endorse or like i think the current csm did ok they were the first and there was alot of newness to overcome it should be noted that some of them were far more useful than others in creating legitmate discussion and keeping the opinions of their voters out there i however dont see anything that i can directly attribute to the csm since they have come forward they have surely added to the discussion and yet because of a lack of communication i think it is hard to attribute those successs directly to the csm how do you feel about the current speedchange and its effect on guerrilla warfare specificallyi think that it breaks the knees of alot of pvp style within eve you are taking one style and often transversing it against another in a rock paper scissors stlye of overseen combat i think the speed nerf is far to hard hitting for a problem that was not that large there was certainly and undisputably an imbalance but as we so often have when we have the pendulum one way rather than search for balance we swing the pendulum the other waypolycarbs needed nerfing and the way that speed mods stacked needed nerfing did the entirety of mwd combat need it i dont think it didif you value things like integrity and trust how do you feel about things like corptheft and scamming in evei hate it i dont like corptheft and i dont like scamming the way that corp theft happens in eve is a necessary evil to ensure we stay within the confines of what you do matters asset management howevermost of the scamming that goes on is directly related to bugs or poor communcation within the contract system and i think that some simple fixs could save alot of trouble methods of scamming where people are just being stupid is there own business and while i dont like it i dont think that gms should have to waste their time with it running much along the lines of what you do matters asset management that makes eve uniquehow do you feel about hisec gankingits been fixed pretty heavily but i would still like to see mabe a 50 increase in the secstanding loss so as to make it so that while your not safe in highsec highsec gankers have to choose legitimate targets and use their security standing sparinglywhat are your views on  the developer misconduct and internal affairsi think he is a necessary evil hes like the media he reports what he sees he certainly has a slant on his opinion so you by no means cannot call him unbiased but in general he did give out the factsi think the developer misconduct was mishandled the communication to the players was so horrible and the response time and rugsweeping was illdone as wellinternal affairs directly arose based on the whole event and while it seems odd to need a department like ia in ccp it has produced good results and at least gives the players someone they feel that they can rely on to keep the field even i would like a report however or some communication on what ia has done to be public just because communication is key in almost all things this kind especially
do you think that eve has in any way diminished in the cold dark universe aspect in the last five years and if so is that a bad thingeve is easier than it was especially for younger players but not significantly so i sent a buddy i had introduced to the game 150m to get him some implants and ships a few days later pirates killed and podded him he wanted more isk but i gave him none eve is a cold dark universe where you need to learn the lessons of survival to both appreciate and enjoy the game so yes its not as cold and dark but its still dark enough for me
do you think actions taken by ia to limit employee access to playing the game is positivewho are you irl whats your background what are your qualificationswhats your platform what do you stand for what do you want to see changed why are these things important to youare these changes feasible do you think adding them would benefit the game as a whole or just specific play styleswhy are you a better choice than anyone youre running againstbesides yourself what other two people would you like to see elected to csm this termif given the opportunity would you take steps to limit corptheft scamming spying and other questionable avenues of gameplay similar to these
what do you feel are the three most important things you can get done as a csm
posting to show my support for vily
do you think actions taken by ia to limit employee access to playing the game is positivecould you be more specificwho are you irl whats your background what are your qualificationsin real life my name is jeffrey groom i just finished my first degree at university and for the last little while have been paying off some debt in my hometown working as a bartenderbar manager i have lots of experience organizing events and managing resources and people education background is in business with a political science minor im qualified because i have played this game for over three years now i have done just about everything that the game offers from pvp to pve mine and run pos i have played with new players and old players and i listen to the best of my ability to my own instincts but also the opinions of those around mewhats your platform what do you stand for what do you want to see changed why are these things important to youin my opening littler dither there i state that i see eve as unique and incredible universe rather brutal one but what we have could use improvement i know that sometimes ccp misses little things that drive old players mad and that a little bit of experience can change things drastically im campaigning on the hope that null sec can continue to reamin playable enjoyable and fun for the people that live there without the continual and drastic shifting towards entrenched territorial power i stand for truth justice and the right to kill anyone who plays this game i believe that the design of eve is so unique and that is what makes it so playable longterm so i stand for the status quo on the idea of eve i dont however stand for the status quo on how the mechanics work on things like titans terriorial warfare pos or guerilla style combat all this is important to me because i love eve and without the constant tweaking and improvement eve is only a single bad patch or one giant communication error from having positive growth to negative growth are these changes feasible do you think adding them would benefit the game as a whole or just specific play stylesyour asking for exact changes which i dont exactly lay out within my campaign so ill give some issuesfixs i would like handledammon balancing  t2 high damage ammo is pointless scorchbarrage is godly fleet ammo is the standard for the rich somewhere in there some things need some love and others need some pain easily feasible and affects everyonetitan balancing  1 button click 60 wrecks while i dont know what the exact fix is there is certainly something that needs to be canged somewhere being both easily feasible and enhancing gameplay for just about everyone within null sec capital rebalancing  pheonixnaglfar are massively underpowered compared to revelationmoros while this would only affect a small group of players directly it would indirectly affect basically the whole of capital warfare which basically effects everyone in nullsecmissiles changes  so that their useful but not so that their overpowered velocity that can be mitigated but not totally removed is it feasible all dpends on how well it has been refinedlowsec rebalancing  there is no real reward to rat or mine in lowsec its more dangerous than 00 and yet it carries no benefit piracy has long needed a reason to get people back into the belts in lowsec and a revival of lowsec as an acutal alternative to 00 combatbountykill rights changes  the selling of kill rights seems so easy it would drastically change the dynamics of the bounty system creating what could possibly be an interesting professioncontract system layout fixing  very simple removes alot of scamming and gm pains in the ass is it feasible i would think easily i think it would it would benefit the game in general with only really minor actual
why are you a better choice than anyone youre running againstexperience fundamental understanding of game mechanics and the people who play this game dedication and the ability to listen and represent the people who lend me their trustbesides yourself what other two people would you like to see elected to csm this termankhesentapemkah because while she does not represent my views in any way shape or form she does represent the people that put her there well she has shown she is actually willing to put the effort and time into this council that is required and because a diversity of viewpoints often creates the best discussion and outcomepattern clarc because he seems organized and well versed he has a focus on communication that i agree with and like and seems to be the kind of guy i could see myself working with productively on the councilif given the opportunity would you take steps to limit corptheft scamming spying and other questionable avenues of gameplay similar to thesescamming only in the way listed above simple contract fixesspying only within faction warfare where you cannot even remove the spys you knowcorptheft i would like to have possibly a givetake log created viewable by the ceodirectors so that culprits could be properly identified but otherwise noas for other questionable gameplay its very case by case some i can think of logging off before you dissappear timer could be a little longer cloaking timers 1m cooldown every couple of hours or something afk cloaking pain remote repping in empire causing proper flagging in a way that wont get abused
1  ensure that the coming changes to territorial warfare are done properly and do not favor any one side or entrenched interest doing so in a way that also promotes combat for the fives man gang as well as the fifty man gang2  communication communication communication ccp needs to communicate better on nearly everything we the players scream for more information daily and yet we often get a single developer response when we should have fifty talking to people even when your ignoring them can make a huge amount of difference as a csm one of the most important things i would like to dosee done is to have ccp improve this whether it means employees dedicated to it or just simply a little more clarity within what people at ccp do would also like to see an open piece of internal affairs with visible actionswhatever but being the realist i am i could only hope for minimal results at best with that3  create a role purpose or identity for the csm get some minor things accomplished but let it be known that it was the csm that did it if ccp wants this council to be successful they have to allow it to get some results that the people can see and attribute to the csm alot of people claim the csm is useless and the only way to break that stereotype is to get some stuff done once we do that the more clout we can gather as csm representatives

currently the vast 00 is very underpopulated as gamers we have it in our best interests to increase the viability of this portion of the game i would like to use this thread as an opportunity to evaluate how knowledgeable the candidates are on 00 candidates vision for 00 and how candidates would field proposals made regarding 00alternatively if you are not expressly a 00 advocate in your candidacy consider this an opportunity to showcase your ability to act as a responsible csm in areas outside your expertise by smartly engaging the ideas and eloquently addressing their implications for topics within your area of expertise cool discussion is definitely a metric of csm viabilityidea theft is perfectly fine and indicative of ability to pick a good idea when its presentedin what ways would you like to see 00 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvementhow do you see the ability to operate in 00 evolving to improve and keep up with the gamewhat improvements would you like to see in 00 as an endgame things to reward players for having made ithow would you raise the status of 00 in a productive way to enrich the gameare you in favor of any role separation or gapfilling with regard to the infrastructure of 00 in the way that the orca will fill a gap and most t2 ships occupy clearly defined roleschanges to any capitals or subcaps in context of healthier 00any other comments in areas not covered by the questionsfinally im a breakdancer in the real world elements of style and expressions of soul are indispensable to anything i do and will greatly affect my selection of csm candidates how would you make 00 coolerplease reply only with your answers until at least the first page is up so that the thread can stay dense with important information after that id love to see some intelligent discussion on the subjects and get a feel for candidates abilities to work towards proposals that are filled with win and all that good stuff
id like to see more sources of income for the average alliance member things to do besides ratting mining and running exploration sites your alliance might be mining the pretty moons but that does not flow into the wallet of the grunts and instead of a salary they have to pay taxes i think things need to be more interesting more rewarding for the masses below the executive level however i also think that the real empirebuilders should have more empireshaping game mechanics things to build and fight over besides those dull outposts npcs should react to what the players do this can come in the form of agents appearing in outposts or pirate complexes showing up on the fringes only to disappear again if the players crack down on them if players can set up their own missions to request services of other players either through agents or an improved contracting systems all the better i am a firm believer of playerdriven worlds and it is time for the world of eve to react to player presence and actionsi also think that it should be quicker for new powers to get something out of 00 if they are skilled this would encourage fresh blood to give 00 a tryid really like to see a rework of the 00 sovereignty mechanics pos warfare is dull and boring for the participants what i would like to see is objectives besides pos warfare worked out in a way that smaller mobile gangs can get behind enemy lines cause some damage and get some loot in the process and get out again this way tactical gameplay is encouraged more instead of just mustering the biggest fleet to the fight it can also be set up in such a way that it provides direct reward to the participants encouraging people to participate in 00 conflictsi will discuss 00 with ccp in a few days at the fanfest so instead of telling you what i would ill tell you what i did i still would like to see a largehull exploration vessel as it is stupid that people are required to have two accounts one to scan and one to clear the site or move a load of jumps to fetch another shipnot yet objectives for smaller fast mobile fleets firstcool is subjective and even though i have plenty of ideas as displayed above id still like a lot more of community feedback to hear what they think is cool and should be added to 00
in what ways would you like to see 00 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvement00 income is where it should be at its higseclowsec income that is out of balance with a proper balancing to the rewards of highsec you make 00 more appealing and thus create a more diverse populationhow do you see the ability to operate in 00 evolving to improve and keep up with the gameunfortunatly at the moment the evolution of 00 has taken the wrong direction favoring more to heavily entrenched parties unable to be removed by even the most powerful forces i think there needs to be a rebalance within 00 to allow for smaller groups to be more viable and change the outcome of warfare how would 00 change if silos were outside a pos shield and built like a cynojammerwhat improvements would you like to see in 00 as an endgame things to reward players for having made itmore 00 agents more asteroid belts better ore balanced by better ore within lowsec within the medalsawards systems some 00 specific awards some interesting complex variations that cannot be farmed yet provide unique rewardsin reality if you want to reward 00 players give them lagless servers and some new ways to make money other than grinding rats in a belthow would you raise the status of 00 in a productive way to enrich the gamei have no idea what this means 00 has rewards and is enriched by the fact its the major pvp arena of eveare you in favor of any role separation or gapfilling with regard to the infrastructure of 00 in the way that the orca will fill a gap and most t2 ships occupy clearly defined rolesa cheaper jump freigher would be nice something that can effectively fuel pos without being a mothership size target personally i think people should have to fly large bubbles  but im not really pushing thatchanges to any capitals or subcaps in context of healthier 00im a heavy advocate for changes to the way supercapitals work titans being far too overpowered and motherships being underpowered if you could provide a new role for motherships more applicable to being actual mobile bases then it would in my view contribute to a healthier 00any other comments in areas not covered by the questionsmobile combats affect on territorial powers needs to be severly looked athow would you make 00 cooler better backgrounds nebulas to blackholes to something besides the bland eight different space backgrouds we currently have within ambulation your going to be able to go inside stations it would certainly be nice to pain some of the ones we have pink stations ftwsome unique rewardsmedals from 00 killing officer spawns grants a medal for instance

level five missions should be placed in 00 space but with greater reward rats should give more bounty npcplayer trade missions between 00 and empire space to player owned stations that give a more or less moderate income and equippment flow but wh
i like the idea of sentry guns that can be anchored at outposts and gates and opening jove space as a huge npc region would be very interesting alot of combat with the freedoms of 00 and without the penalties of low sec

greetingsmy name is andreas keiser iUFFFDm from switzerland and i am one of the new runners for the csmand here are my goals for this csm termforwarding the wishes of the players to ccpmaking sure that ccp adds more 00 space why itUFFFDs getting crowded here and this would help to give more corps the opportunity establish a base in 00 spacemaking sure that the nano problem is taken care off by nerfing them why itUFFFDs total nonsens that a ship can fly faster then a missle and even if the missle is fast enough it doesnUFFFDt do much damage i say make fights with bs and other ships interesting againoutlaw scamming why scamming contributes to the high player count in jita and other trade systems and itUFFFDs a pathetic way of making iskimplementing a rule that the members of the ccp stafffrom director to gmare not allowed to participate in eveonlinewith a player account or otherwiseor are not allowed to join player corps while offduty and why i want this there could be a conflict of interests
in detail answer the following questions if you pleaseim interested to hear what your opinion is on social manipulation in regards to the sandbox game that eve is supposed to be especially in regards to scamming corporate theft and ship hijacking from poses as well as extortion by means of war declarations and verbal ic threatsfurthermore id like you to expand upon your statement that you will be pushing for ccp to leave player run corporations  not be allowed to play their own game please state reasons and cite evidence to support your argument if any is availablesofia
about the social manipulation issuemy problem with scammers is that they trick players into buying stuff because those people donUFFFDt read the fine print yes itUFFFDs their fault and they shouldnUFFFDt get a refund for that but do we need that and if a scammer wants to make money he should do what everyone else does piracy missions wars mining rattingcorporate theft is just that theft if you steal from your own corp youUFFFDre a thief and thatUFFFDs worth a ban in my opinion ship hijacking from an enemy pos is legit if you shoot down the pos first if you acquire the codes to the pos however itUFFFDs a total different thing for me iUFFFDm a bit draconic about that but spying is a no go if you join a corp pretend to be a friend of someone and then betray them thatUFFFDs not funny anymore yes i know the game should be realistic and not everything is funny in real even so spying and betraying is just spineless if you want to fight then fight with your ships and with tactics not with spysextortion by war declartation is legit but the declaration system needs a rework even if a war ends very fast when itUFFFDs not mutual you can declare war again to fast there should be a longer waiting period before you can declare war againt the same enemy again like half a yearand about extortion by verbal threats in character threats are also legit but as soon as it starts to get personalrlitUFFFDs a no goand about the issue of ccp employees in player corporationswhat happens when you join a player corporation youUFFFDre working with others together wage war with them build up an empire with them and after a while you will become friends and start to care about them so what happens if someone needs help because he recycled his dreadnought because he was drunk or needs information about another corp will you help him or not and thats my reason why i want that ccp employees arenUFFFDt allowed to join player corps because who can guarantee that they are always professional in their judgement when they have to decide over someone they know or are friends with
ignorance is bliss eve has been sold as a cold harsh world reality can be a pain sometimes andthis is an example of it what it looks like is youre trying to relate corporate theft to rl incidents when the two only have minor similarities capsuleers arent governed by the same rules as others as well as the fact that the empires nor concord dont really involve themselves in corporate affairs why should they do so now what makes corporate theft such a serious issue that it deserves a banagain cold harsh world you dont get to choose everything that happens to you and there is always a bigger fish simplifiying methods just for certain peoples perception of safety is a pretty poor excuse for such a thing dont you think in the end social manipulation is a core part of any mmo and thus if the rules allow it should be allowed free reign how people use their resources is up to them but i believe that was ccps definition of the sandboxwhy such a long period of time this needs clarificationand about the issue of ccp employees in player corporationseeeeh people are responsible for themselves if they can log in its not a nanny state its a place where personalities can take the fore and thats how people come to have opinions on others however i can see your point regarding ccp but measures less drastic ones at that have been taken that seem to be working sufficiently well internal affairs clarify why you think that there needs be a crackdown in the coming months
as far as getting rid of scamming eve is a game of consequences for your actions if you cant figure out your about to be scammed you deserve to be deprived of your iskwe dont need more 00 space what the true problem is 00 leads to entrenched warfare and doesnt make room for the new guy to make headway thats the true problemeither way do not want
good morningone of the my ideas that you may find very interesting is that with the change to ghost training i would support bringing back the 30 day time code this idea is simple as well as a money winner for ccp contrary to popular opinion not everyone is making billions of isk a week in this game the same pilots also may not make enough real life money to support that second or third account if ccp would bring back the 30 day gtc now many pilots like myself might bring those accounts back online lets face it grinding 220250 million isk a month means more time for pvp or whatever you like to do in this game let me know how you feelrorin
bringing back 30day gtcs while i would love to see it wont cut down the price all that much by using simple econonmics we can see that theres too large a demand for 60day gtcs compared to the supply if you think that grinding that much isk is a problem and want it to be less then make more people sell gtcs
this is a interesting idea but not workable my idea is to cut down the gtc prices as much as possible so that pilots all over eve can play the game they love in the way they like not the one size fits all that has now been forced on us lots of pilots think the gtc prices are too high right now my question to you is why would we want to make more people sell gtcs the way to bring down the price slowly to a level where the game is once more affordable for all is not by restricting the market and peoples options but by expanding themrorin

i support this even though i stand to benefit from it not being changed  i dont think people should be penalized for not realizing that the messages needed html formatting put in i consider myself lucky that i caught this when i submitted it and correctly guessed that html would do the trick but i dont think other people should be penalized for this
supported  bump
good idea falcon rook etc require appropriate answer p s falcon rook requires nerf permajamm is smth awesome

bump
agree
hmm please do show us your fitting except youre a minmatar speced pilot who flys amarr capitals this only proves that minmatar caps sucki was very temped to train for amarr capitals myself but decided to stay true with minmatar even though they suck role playing kinda thing
a couple of weeks ago we had biggest longrunning soap opera in eve pf resolved at last by the coronation of jamyl sarum as empress of the amarr empire this is the resolution of a very old plotline  tied into the eve novel the empyrean age backstory  important to faction warfare and should be of vital interest to anybody roleplaying a character in the game of eve online only somehow it wasntand i dont think you need to be a rocket scientist to understand what was missing the potential for player interaction the coronation was handled off screen  it didnt happen in space in any kind of event that players could get involved with there were no illadvised player assassination attempts no show of strength from the amarr navy no centre stage for amarrian pc corps and alliances no focus point for dissidents and protests or a hundred little stories of actual players trying to involve themselves with this thing it was in short a canned showandtell snowglobe style happening that doesnt really deserve to be called an event since there was literally nothing that any player in the universe of eve could do to affect it and it doesnt matter how beautiful and glorious the canned video imagery is  and it doesnt matter how many times were told that the speech was inspiring  unless were there in space to see it to hear it to experience it  this is just uninspiring fluff and deeply below the standards weve come to expect from the eve online now a little historyi remember an event almost 4 years ago that i attended that came to be called the elarel massacre by those players present and who heard about the things that happened there second hand and in the news reverberating in the days afterwards the premise of the event was pretty simple  it was the launch of the quafe ultra product range by quafe corporation  and they were hosting a huge party for the best and brightest of the federation celebrity set alongside screenings of some racy holodrama with semi naked brutor girls cavorting in tribal costumes quafe had deployed a prototype outpost for the proceedings  a pleasure garden station id been contacted by storyline people roleplaying quafe executives a week or so before and asked to a organise a player party around the events and b provide a security detail for the event to ensure nothing untoward would happenso i did what i was asked really invited pretty much everyone in my address book and ensured that elarel was going to have every famousinfamousacclaimed and notorious player that i could nail down and meanwhile jericho fraction decided to do the security duty with some style and we all flew the brand spanking new interceptor class ships 30 or so that we considered back then were simply better than battleships UF04A remember that crows used to be able to fire cruise missilesanyways  the night of the event rolled around and everybody came elarel was packed out  the pleasure gardens station was in place none of us had ever seen a capturable outpost back then local was full of chat and repartee and the events team had provided what seemed like dozens of fully briefed npc characters  quafe organizers celebrities holoactresses and musicians politicians and security liasons  the whole shebang and these celebs sure turned up in style  flashy ships escorts opus luxury yachts real opulence and atmospheric decadence so we had our show and tell moments sure but it was all in space we were there we could lock onto the ships we could settle our own scores and feuds while the event was going on players tried ganking celebs players got counter ganked and podded curses and brutality  but the event rolled on
then all hell broke lose the plotline had provided an entire attack wing of rightwing zealot lunatics called udi  who turned up in waves of cruisers and heavier ships and attacked  well everyone it was carnage and chaos streams of missile bombardments and gunfire celebs going up in flames the player guests joining in the adhoc defense our heavily outgunned interceptors dogfighting event team characters pleading and begging to be spared in local while the pleasure gardens station begin to take heavy damage and everyone was warned to get to minimum safe distance this was epic stuff some of the best couple of hours gaming ive ever had with mmorgs the players took heavy losses but some of them made out like absolute bandits  i took part in the rescue of one celeb from udi attack guiding another player in with a tempest to pick up the celebs crew okay cargo can under heavy fire and meanwhile another guy was convincing some other celebs to eject from their opus yacht to save their skins opus was subsequently stolen and sold onto the private marketeventually the gallente navy turned up with president fouritan in personal attendance and the event turned into a qa speechifying session and plenty of conspiracy theories were in wild attendance it was certainly the case that fundamentalist udi murders did wonders for fouritans eventual reelection campaignbut you see the point this is an event i still remember 4 years after it happened hell this is an event that a great many old players still remember fondly it had a huge impact at the time it was exciting it was bold it was something id never seen before in online computer games and it was closer to full on interactive storytelling with player action really counting hell if wed come with battleships wed probably have aced the udi and routed the buggers  but our choice to be gungho flashy soandsos in our brand spanking new interceptors meant we couldnt effective counter the multiple waves of udi ships and the pleasure gardens blew up but so many smaller tales  the guy that go away with the opus  the victims that got assassinated during the party  the nationalists that got to rant at the president in real time the pure chaos and conflict environment  it seemed real it was all about suspension of disbelief and it was absolutely a perfect slice of eve is anyone going to remember the jamyl sarums coronation event in four years timeso enough reminiscence lets get down to some practicalities the reason we dont have events like these any more is partially down to the maturing of eve online as a game and ccp as a company they have become more risk adverse over time and as the game has become serious business we see less and less of this kind of crazy icelandic thinking lets run an event where all the devs get to play murderous fanatics shooting celebs at a quafe party and any player that brings a ship to get in the way  and more and more routine boring workaday hands off canned event mediocrityand its partly down to fiascos and disasters of the past  make no mistake aurora the old events team was very far from perfect  it made some terrible events alongside its great events it did sometimes have a stink of corruption in some of the things it got involved in free motherships for 00 alliances massive event rewards for following scripts godmodding private events volunteer actors using aurora to benefit their friends and allies in game who knows how much of this stuff is true how much its urban myth jealousy or just simple confusions and mistakes but aurora did end up with a bad reputation at the end of it that led to its virtual dissolution in the wake and continuing fallout from the t20 scandal
and of course we the players need to take some blame too events team was always plagued with a player events crew that spent their whole lives camping ircrp channels and jumping on the merest suggestion of an event with all the firepower at their fingertips to score those epic event drops by shooting anything that needed protecting by exploiting the aurora rules of engagement and generally acting like hungry hippos rather than roleplaying with aurorabut it comes down to thishave we lost too much has ccps understandable reaction to the accusations of bias cheating stuff spawning corrupt events and whatnot actually denied a huge number of honest and decent players from access to an ongoing and active events team has the baby been thrown out with the bathwater herenow ive been to ccps hq ive met the guys and girls there im convinced these are decent passionate committed people who love the game of eve love the mythology and have a lot of time and energy to commit to the player base and community ive also met internal affairs and been briefed on the scarily efficient procedures that now exist to ensure we arent going to get another t20 scandal in a hurry ive been shown around ive been given unrestricted access to employees of this company ive asked hard questions and ive come away convinced that ccps house is in order so now ive got to ask myself and anybody reading this threadgiven the improvements that ccp have made to the accountability of developeremployee behaviour and the checks and balances that have been implemented why should live events of the kind that used to enliven and promote this game immensely still be sacrificed on the pyre of last years developer misconductscrew t20 to be quite honest that stuff happened its been addressed ccp have moved on and so i think have we but lets not cheat ourselves out of all the great things that we could have from a dynamic and exciting live events team by dwelling on the misdeeds of one set of virtual stickyfingers a couple of years ago  so id like to propose quite simply that ccp fund and implement a new live events team that works as a combination of old aurora and new mercury and unites the best bits of actual ingame event running playerinvolvement dynamic plotlines with conflict and explosions and the current excellent storytelling and news publication we are seeing around empyrean age and related player actionsin order to make sure it avoids the pitfalls of the past this new live events team will need to have its events properly audited  it will need to list the props and justify them  itll need to fill out a record of what happens at events and where the good stuff went of course but that shouldnt be considered a huge onerous burden so much as just good practise when running a vast interactive roleplaying game of the sort that eve online can truly benow sure this is expensive in terms of manpower  ccp would need to spend money to make this happen but then again  everything takes money development of the tiniest code alteration takes loads of it ultimately part of the role of the csm was to advise ccp on what the players wanted to see from them  which priorities were most pressing where people wanted to see the game going in the future and i feel quite confident in saying at this point that a substantial number of players want the bold exciting nonconformist ccp that were prepared to take risks and do things that sony and blizzard would never dream of this is a single server with a united history and the greatest community that any game of this kind is ever likely to get
fundamentally eve needs live ingame events that well be talking about in 2012 to get these we need a liveevents team and we need to ccp to stop panicking about corruption scandals and bad press and have the faith in the procedures theyve established and actions theyve taken and restore the functionality that aurora once had in an improved form with the accountability and trust required to take events forward and keep eve as the unique and exciting game it truly can be
that sounds like a rather impressive event id love to see more of them on that level as long as you avoid abuses and i think they will this stuff adds a whole lot to the game
still annoyed i didnt get the yacht
i caught the tail end of aurora entering cain after the brothers of freedom storyline kicked off this storyline lead to a larger story of a conflict between the now defunct acheron federation closed phoenix wing and strix against cain and the now shadow of its former self apex conglomerate if it even still exist the big names from it became pirates anarchist and freespacers it seems this is where i first got introduced to pvp beyond pirate gate camps on low sec gates my first kill a new strix member mining in an iteron i hope he is still in strix and the lose of a few of my own ships to good fights the storyline making the news is what got me into rp in the first placenow i have to watch as my characters megacorp is dragged through the mud and research halts because noh is diverting supplies from lai dai cause suvee wants to mine instead of farm how do i get to interact i dont and nothing changes in world because i dont all those research alts still will get their datacores even though the research agents are starvingrp is what causes to stick to with eve
sounds like pretty epic stuff pity i missed itid love to see it come back but you also have to take ccps view of itwith the number of people playing eve increasing monthly inspace events have the potential to draw many hundreds maybe even thousands of players to a single point in a single system this would create a lagbomb rivaling the greatest 00 alliance fights which would then lead to all the familiar lagbomb effects people unable to load the grid  outright crashing people losing ships which they may very well have out fitted with their best stuff due to the nature of the event due to above effects hundreds of petitions being spammed at ccp due to lost stuff the potential of crashing the node which could ruin the whole event etc etc etcso you see creating an ingame event these days could produce a truly incredible headache for ccp this could be remedied by temporarily instituting a population cap on whatever system the event was to be in but then people would be complaining about itid still like them to return though just playing devils advocate here
yeah i remember that and more more events  when these events happened battles were forgotton and everyone jumped in  every event i remember was epic and a epic read  great funi remember one where salvadore sarparti was flying through tribute area with a fleet all flown by i assume gms and dvs  gate camps forgotton and everybody hustled to get theretoo many events to mention and ignoring the shouts of hax etc the events were well intentioned wasnt there one transporting supplies and a prize given to the winning corpthere was a planet that sort of died mordus legion fleets flying around everyone of them fun to read about or try to participate indefinately has my vote
yes pleaseits a shame that there are so many threads on this it would be nice to see everyone in one ultimate threadnaught
i already voted for the topic with all of my chars however i will just keep posting here to keep the thread on topi think this will be the only topic which will actually get 5 of eve population approval to be discussed on csm lol  in any casegief fukin queue  just lost half a day of training ffs 
full fukin support 
supporting 
what i want is the ability to change skills via my internet browser iefirefoxlike so wed be able to set new skills just about anywhere without having to log directly in the gameplus a oneskill queue could be great
nice idea
well where there is will there is a waysome things that can be considered to reduce worries of abuse only allow a certain amount percentage of your real sp to be trained instant or extremely fast also make a reset option to revert to your real skills so people can try out different new content set a minimum online level to make sure it is an active player on the live server i am not sure ccp has all these statistics but it should not be too hard to get something that serves the same purposemy favorite option would be option one as this allows players to test things that are beyond their reach or not even live yet but not do so in a disproportionate way this fully removes any abuse of new players dogfighting in titans or whatever
against i swear of a frickin storm
let me start with a little bit of history long time ago in a galaxy far away there was an alliance called fountain alliance my corp was was living in it doing what new corps in 00 are doing mining stuff and rattiing and losing ships back in those days there were no posses no capitals no black ops cynosular fields were never been heard of jump technology was something the jovians were experimenting with and failed badly and their remains were scattered all around the galaxyanyways back in these old days the transportation of goods and the logistics of a corp went differently than they go today in order to get our ships replaced we needed ships on market or minerals some of which were scarce resources in our region we were organizing convoys from fountain to empire a few combat ships lots of frigates we were escorting our zydrine filled haulers up the pipes to empire there we brought new ships and escorted ourselves and our isogen and module filled haulers back to fountain in an organized way we had to do this as a corp event or sometimes our alliance did it as an alliance event it was a social activity with lots of people participating on our way up we met raiding fleets which needed to be taken care of we ran into gate camps which actually had a reason to camp there as they were there for the loot not just for griefing losers in empty ships despite the fact that the maximum number of players on server never went above 10000 00 was a much more vivid place than it is today in the age of jump clones jump freighters carriers titans twinned bridges and ship maintenance baysback in those days raiding gangs had actual achievable goals disrupting logistics gate camps had goals loot valuable stuff and prevent enemies from returning to fleet battles there were roaming gangs of all possible sizes from small to large gate camps from small to large often aimed at preventing our enemies from slipping in one by one into our npc stations these are times i enjoyed the most in my eve career i miss them a lot and i think i know the reason why this has changed and this is also the reason why people recently find 00 a lifeless underused empty space i think the main reason for this is not that there are not enough people the reason is that there is not enough traveling around because it can be solved elsehow even those who travel do not risk all too much one does not need to be a genius to see why the amount of travel has decreased jump clones provide a way for completely safe transportation from one end of the galaxy to another jump freighters carriers rorquals are also nearly 100 secure methods of transporting large amounts of wealth in and out of 00 jump bridge networks maintained by big alliances allow joe average to travel from his 00 home to empire in a safe and a quick way that was never possible before these very same bridge networks combined with titan bridges make it possible to get back into fleet fights instantly safe hauling kills most of the logical and ethical reasons for small size gate camps jump bridges make roaming gangs useless titan bridges into fight make camping pipes around battlezones useless today roaming gangs are not nearly as fun as they were earlier why because there are not enough people in 00 wrong they are not fun because there is not enough movement in 00 it does not make much sense to blockade pipes or hold empire chokepoints i think instead of finding a new objective for small sized roaming gangs it would make sense to look around and ask ourselves where did the old objectives goso this is it this is an issue i know the problem but i do not know the solution discuss
this is why industrial transport and normal freighters should be buffedim not sure what im supporting but i do believe that the good pvp does not necessarily have to revolve around logistics sure you can protect your haulers with zydrine but it nothing prevents a bunch of griefers to alpha down your haulers so a buff to industrial ships and make them more attractive to use
by supporting this you support that this is a problem worth mentioning to ccp
totally agree with op
ccp have no excuse not to give us a skill queue now that the orrible ghost training bug has been fixed
10
i support this post for 100 and i am pretty sure that at least 99100 of the eve community will support this idea it would certainly make me play more as i have more time to finish reallife matters as these matters are finished i will have more time to spend ingame as i wont have to interrupt reallife matters just to change skills1
definitely yes
yes
yes
bring it back

i vote nothe op and most of the others here want to discourage pve players from remaining in pve corps i hate to break it to you but there are a lot of players in this game like me i play eve because it is the only space game i and my other real life friends can all log into and pretend we are starship captains working together towards whatever end is entertaining us on a given day however i have this persistant delusion that my character is better than in other similar games because of the offline skill training i have time to play maybe 1 to 4 hours a week some weeks not at all eves training system is good for mefor my friends and i our skills in this game suck our player vs player skills i mean some of our characters have lots of points we have no wish to pvp at all ever what is the point i suppose that is another topic alltogether but we enjoy reading about the pvp and 00 wars in the game we play we just have no wish to partake of those activities ourselvesin another year or so star trek online will come out and after this weeks announcement star wars online v20 will be out a few years after that and we will try those games for our pve fix if they are better than eve pve wise we will stay there if eve is better than ccp will continue to get our 15 a monthccp is here to make money like every corporation their goal should be to maximize long term profits for their shareholders this means accomodating mutiple styles of play at the same time there are people that do not want to pvp ever some of them play the game just to talk with others some play the game to mine or to build or to buy and sell some play the game to collect and fly all the pretty little ships when ambulation is put in some players will play just to hang out in space stations and flirt with other characters ccp needs to accomodate these players or they leave going back to the op topic i am still in a newbie corp often when asked why i dont join a player corp i give the glib no tax and no wardec here answer the real answer is long and involved and there is a good chance that the other player wont understand that i just dont care about the parts of the game i am missing sothere are several people not my real life friends in my newbie corp that have been there for more than 3 years they log in often some daily and chat and play the game however they wish get over it
agreed i say put the tax at a flat rate for everyone slightly above what most player corps charge
there is no point at all in depriving pve players of their game as it is and they should have the most fun they can have in it just like pvp players do the only thing ccp has to be careful about is balancing income between the two and dont forget there is a grey area as well the market scams and what more resources that are being competed forsome of the most loved implants that pvp players enjoy originate from the pve part of the game why discourage that or for players to be vulnerable to wars as soon as they go low sec to have an edge over their competing pve colleagues they are vulnerable to pirates and whatever danger there isnpc corp or noti as a pvp player would have no fun decing corps that are pure pve or mining oriented sure the first few juiy kills the noob chat etc fine but its not lasting so there is no point in forcing them out id rather see low sec be made less safe as a pirate by nerfing sentry guns so small ships can also work thereeve is a coalition of different playing styles and its not always perfectly balanced but ccp should not try to force everyone into one style people affected wont accept it and leave as soon as they find out there is no way they can even compete what do the pvp layers gain from itless income for cpp  less content less piracy opportunities we got to do more grinding ourselves to get said implants and what elseso i strongly reject this proposal
this issue was voted on and rejected by the csmyou may try to raise it again for the next csm term though
so go prove that my options for achura will be better than the options you get oh wait we dont have any information on thatthat only lets us change to another portrait of the same bloodline and genderthat is all im asking for when ambulation comes out all existing characters get a chance to change their bloodline and gender once when creating their first avatar then we are all locked into the choice we make
not something world shaking but a good suggestionsupported
ok i just saw this post that explains it but its still a rude behavior shown there from the gm
it just doesnt make any sense not to have a repair option in context menu while destructive options like trash are in there what is so different about repair that it should not be in there next to refine contract reprocess and trash clarificationto repair anything everyone i know will currently select everything they own in a station in the item selection window that you get after clicking on the repair button this because it is very cumbersome to select the things you want to have repaired manually in a scrollable checkbox list the result of this inefficient interface is lag sever load and since recentlyprolonged locking off all your assets even after the repairs are long done this means you cant change ships because they are being repackaged when in fact they are not then you got to relog to be able to change ship again etc not goodcomparison with contractswhen ccp introduced the same interface for contracts as we still have for repair people were falling over them left right and center then they changed it a little there to make it more workablethere still is a difference however with contracts you can do an asset search or simple select your ship and then rightclick create contract so here at least you have the option of making the choice of what you want the contract to affect in step 1 of the process people use this and kind of ignore the new selection window ccp put in there in between which serves no one in the slightest its just dead weightthis first step selection is what we need for repairs as well to make it workable and reduce server load
i am supporting my own issue o
why change them so they have an effect already  ccp have already hinted at tech3 coming with info coming at fanfest why not have the skills being used for benefits to t3 construction rather than changing the current playing field
well not all ships reduction but t2 t2 ships produce few days when t1 battleship can build x7 in 1 day
good to see you going for the csm good luck
eva has done a good job in the first csm term i have talked with her a lot and her moderate position and professional views have always impressed me when she says balancing she is fully neutral balancing does not mean kill the big players no when she says balancing she wants to introduce attractive objectives for the smaller players she will not take away she will addshe wants to improve transparency of the csm improve communication to both ccp and the player base right she is she has drawn the right conclusions of the first termher forum take care which is a political party if you want is a great way of further focussing issues and it also helps communicationi will vote for ankhesentapemkah
ill vote ankhesentapemkah as well when i figure out where i can vote ive mailed with her in game and she seems a very great candidate she has very good points made on her site and i think shes someone who stands her ground
voting opens on november 7th
endorsed here ive had experiences of a number of the issues that you bring to light
i agree with ignition i happen to think altering local would be a big mistake as it works fine its hard to find candidates that support this stance
i vote for this man not only because he is my alliance leader and ceoi like his program hope his knowledge of game will be determining factor to enter csm
why do you bother with the whole csm hulabaloo you know you cant force ccp to do or not to do something they wont listen  well they pretend to listen but they just dont careso why bother 
been flying with vuk on and off for 4 years gets my vote every timegl m8
you can count on my vote as i know i can count on your wisdom
thanks for doing this vukdefinitly the best choice for a csm
the great things in history were achieved by optimists only not pessimists great jacques custou said onceso my votes to the optimistic approach of vuk  go get em tiger 
whats your thoughts on the risk vs reward of level 4 missions in highsecand a huge bump to a stand up candidate and the best writer of battlereports
excelent player who knows how eve works have my vote
whats sad is he isnt the controversial candidate that some are and therefore might not get some of the same exposure to the rank n file hordes of ppl who play eve hopefully they take a look at this and realize that vuk cant be bad for the csm there are some other candidates running though that could bevuk id like the money deposited in my account after your elected p thanxs
tip of the day 3i have been commited to letting people know what has been going on with the csm during the current term one of these ways have been trough the magic of internet spaceship podcastsim featured in following podcastswda 42wda 40wda 32  preelection predictions
what do you believe csm should achieve as an entity do you believe the previous session did thathow do you feel about the current speedchange and its effect on guerrilla warfare specificallyif you value things like integrity and trust how do you feel about things like corptheft and scamming in evehow do you feel about hisec gankingwhat are your views on  the developer misconduct and internal affairsdo you think that eve has in any way diminished in the cold dark universe aspect in the last five years and if so is that a bad thing
hello vs well it really depends on whats important for the community at the time right now the community wants a skill queue would that be the ultimate achievement to make ccp commit to make a skill queue yeah the first csm isnt done yet and it seems like it will be raised again for discussion with ccp but also the csm should communicate alot while its not an achievement per say its damn important this first csm failed at thatso far from flying on sisi its quite ok its not the best but hey im a big fan of diversity and variety right now we have a large spectrum of speeds and how much you can survive the nano nerf will squize that a bit together possibly making it a bit more predictable however it will take more actual piloting skills to do as its currently done but i still think it will be viablebut it still doesnt cure the cause of nanoing blobbing i very much value integrity and trust however corptheft and scamming is a part of eve and i respect that people do it i have been scammed before but i think its a valid professionthis is a very valid profession however its currently possible to gank almost worthless targets and still gain profit from it because insurance almost covers the whole loss but sec status loss i think insurance should be removed from highsec gankingthe  case was a can of worms obviously he did technically break the eula and ccp does reserve all rights to ban anybody at any time  could be unbanned however im not sure about his intentions at allthe csm spoke to the head of internal affairs at our iceland meetings and judging from the way its being done im pretty sure they will find out of a ccp employee does something bad yeah i think it has diminished not only from an actual game universe perspective but also from a social perspective we have obviously grown in size in terms of players so its hard to find anywhere where there isnt players beyond deep 00 but people has also created some interesting social structures and become increasingly paranoid to scamsi would like to see a more vast experience where theres stuff to do and explore ccp hasnt increased the height of the game as players grew higher due to power gaming and i think thats what makes a difference eventually
tip of the day 4my main interest out of eve is computer science my first real language was c i soon learned about how nice vbnet is to code in whereafter ricdic made me code the prototypes for ebank it was back when the api was all new and shinyand even back then it left a lot to be desired so nothing changedso yeah ebank is made in vbnet despite how much people tell me i sux for being the reason that we didnt use chowever ix forrez lisa xb95 and others from the evedev channel on coldfront soon made me realize the beauty of ruby
interesting ill be watching
issler dainze  csm candiadate  let me be your voice when you scream in spacei just finished replying to the 00 thread i am looking forward to similar opportunities to provide the pilots of eve i am now going to just say poe a chance to see how each of the csm candidates thinks about what matters most to the voters i encourage folks to post a question or series of questions here in this forum and ask us all to respond i expect you could learn just what to expect from us if you do choose to elect usso bring on those questions ill prime the pump random pilot in eve  what do you all think about quafe do you think ultra is worth the extra iskswell i for one love the citrusy aftertastes of quafe i also find it to be an excellent solvent and use it regularly to clean my mining lasers as for ultra yes for special occasions i think it warants the extra coinwell thats it for now until next time remember stuffs getting better stuffs getting better every day issler dainzecsm candidateceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord
well this lady seems insane enough to actually like the job of csm and take it to heart in making this game a little more colorful yeah definetly voting for her
you have some very good ideas there are areas where it is obvious that eve was intended to be a deal with the consequences of your actions but there is nothing currently in game in regards to the points you have raised i look forward to hearing more from you
votin for goum on one account as i did last time shame theres no jade for him to have a slap fight with though
if you value things like integrity and trust how do you feel about things like corptheft and scamming in evethere is a problem if youve ever run a corporation youd understand that if you intend on never been scammed then running your corporation smoothly and efficiently is virtually impossible when corporations like dice can get scammed to the tune of 300bill you know that its a little more than a few people lacking sufficient grey matter my view on it is that you just have to accept that you might get scammed and when it happens you can always settle it with dps how do you feel about hisec gankingone of the things i love about eve is that there is always a chance when you undock that you might die its one of the things i hope never change beyond that im not too concerned about where the balanace of power is either way if its with the victim or the gankers as so long as its possiblewhat are your views on  the developer misconduct and internal affairskugutsu who seriously i tuned out of the whole t2 ammo spawning bobdev scandaldo you think that eve has in any way diminished in the cold dark universe aspect in the last five years and if so is that a bad thingeve cannot be a mono chromatic environment i feel it would be perfectly fine for eve to be a hustling bustling hive of activity in one area and a dark cold closed environment in the next you could argue that the amount of systems that are empty especially in 00 has vastly diminished however when i started playing in 2005 the number of pilots online on the main cluster averaged at 17k25k obviously the number of systems hasnt increased much drone regions so naturally the coldness and darkness diminished as well however travel between systems has been made easier the main complaint i hear is that this has generally made new eden feel smaller which is understandable however one complaint ive always had about eve is that star systems are far too small there like rooms you pass through theres usually very little interaction rarely anything in them and when entire corporations require constellations to support their numbers npc requirements to the level of lvl 4 empire missions you cant but help think that jeez one man per solar system isnt that kinda ed
there all interlinked and require an epic answer currently writing a massive post about it expect it soon
great idea pixel too bad they dont have a thumbsup option on this forum
how do you feel about the idea of local chat being moved into delayed mode what impact do you think it will have in game
hey vilypoosthere will be nearly 150 titans in the eve universe in a few months should something be done about it ja oder nein will doeve is becoming way too new player friendly imo ccp caving in when faced with massive whining and ing about something thats not broken should this be stopped it is supposed to be a cold harsh universe not hello kitteeh online
i have been wondering around talking to people on vent and ts servers and decided that i should do it more oftenif any peoplecorps would like to speak to me regarding the csm election  ask question express opinions or just have a chat i will be more than willing to oblige contact me ingame  send an eve mail to promithius and we can arrange something from thereafter all communication is the most important aspect of the csmif you are unable to use ts or vent feel free to post questions and the like on this thread
in response to this and this i feel i should make my position clear im not sure how many of you have read the eve novel or follow the eve backstory but those of you who havedo will know that the caldari have elected a petty vicious madman as their leader have squads of armed thugs who wander the streets beating up ethnic minorities they have threatened genocide as a blackmail tactic and have perfomed terrorist activites against their own people as a means of triggering wari dont like that i dont like that at all now maybe its politically incorrect for me to express my dislike for a different culture im certain within the scope of eve its possible to infer that as racism but i truly believe the actions of the caldari state are detestable this has no bearing on any caldari pilot after all noone can help what or where they were born but the ingame caldari state is a terrible thing and i will not hide my dislike for itif that is a factor that infulences your csm voting then i apoligise but the issue was raised and i felt obliged to respond
in what ways would you like to see 00 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvementi wouldnt encourage any adjustments to player and alliance income in 00 because it might throw things out of balance we must remember that 00 is meant to reward the players who are willing to take the risks to be out there if you put up a pos in a 00 system to ratmine from it yes itll generate more wealth than doing it anywhere in empire however you might lose that pos to a hostile force and as a result all the isk youve invested in it risk versus reward how do you see the ability to operate in 00 evolving to improve and keep up with the gamethis will depend on what ccp adds or removes at this point what improvements would you like to see in 00 as an endgame things to reward players for having made it00 space doesnt need to be any wealthier for starters the only real reward i can see is some adjustments to the sovereignty mechanic and pos warfare ccp has made some progress on handling the lag in large battles but they need to continue remedying that situation nothing in my opinion frustrates a player more than being stuck in unplayable lag situations as the battle rages around them the addition of stationgate defenses in sov 4 systems would be nice too as a rewardhow would you raise the status of 00 in a productive way to enrich the gamethere is no real way to raise the status as i see it 00 is called zero point zero for a reason there is no concord out there to protect you or security hits to dissuade someone from attacking you you have you rely upon your own cunning allies and luck to survive out there and prosper are you in favor of any role separation or gapfilling with regard to the infrastructure of 00 in the way that the orca will fill a gap and most t2 ships occupy clearly defined rolesthings appear to be pretty well covered the only thing i can think of at this moment is a boost to the black ops ships and their ability to do covert cynos and bridgeschanges to any capitals or subcaps in context of healthier 00perhaps a change to the titan doomsday in that it gives an adverse status effect webbedsensor dampedcap neutralized for x amount of time to all ships present rather than cause damage that would be more forgiving in a lagged situation than losing your ship outright plus it would promote a real conclusion to the fight where everyone contributes not just the titan pilot this is something i plan to expand upon in my blog this week at wwwavallocnetany other comments in areas not covered by the questionsthe ui needs to be expanded in terms to the overview filters the ability to have incappedoffline pos modules vanish from overview would help for sieges the opposite goes for people repping a pos too because having to lock a module to see if it has been repped adds an unnecessary step especially when you have brackets turned off another addition to ui would be percentages on shieldarmorhull that you have locked that way you know exactly what the pos has for remaining shield health
issler dainze  csm candidate  let me be your voice when you scream in space1 in what ways would you like to see 00 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvementthere are huge income opportunities in 00 already it is the mechanics of getting the wealth out this is the issue2 how do you see the ability to operate in 00 evolving to improve and keep up with the game00 should be the hardest and most rewarding place in eve there should be more about it that is special 00 deserves to be more exotic than just high sec with no concord there should be things i can see there or do there that i cant find anywhere else3 what improvements would you like to see in 00 as an endgame things to reward players for having made iti refuse to accept the concept of the eve endgame i do accept however that the most challenging experiences in eve should live in 00 if there is one single thing i can think of that i beleve is wrong about 00 it is that currently 00 is biased dramatically towards large corps or alliances somehow 00 needs to be made more accessable to smaller groups and individuals think about the stories of the wild west which is how i think of 00 the lone gunman or the small band of gunfighters hard for them to survive in 00 at the moment4 how would you raise the status of 00 in a productive way to enrich the game00 needs to be more exotic if you choose to go there you should have experiences that cant be found anywhere else every 00 area should have something unique about it an ore a mob an npc or a spacial characteristic5 are you in favor of any role separation or gapfilling with regard to the infrastructure of 00 in the way that the orca will fill a gap and most t2 ships occupy clearly defined rolesif i understand the question yes there needs to be a way for a smaller corporation or alliance to create a safer way to get back and forth from empire to the badlands somethink like a smaller jump gate that would be allowed to create a path between low sec and 00 without sov restrict it so it is only useful for industry and not combat this is just a thought i would want to think about how this would work some more6 changes to any capitals or subcaps in context of healthier 00a blockade runner that could beat a bubble camp a capital ship that can function like a mobile trade hub lots of things that could be done7 other commentsi think low sec is even more broken than 00 there is no doubt that there should be a clear linear relationship for risk and reward as a pilot leaves high sec for low sec and eventually the badlands not only should the risks be a linear increase the rewards should be as well also there needs to be more than valuable drops and exotic ores as you descend in security status there needs to be interesting things as well i should want to go there for more than the balance of my wallet or the lack of security there should be unique things to see there8 how would you make 00 cooleraliensremember stuffs getting better stuffs getting better every dayissler daizecsm candidateceo tadakatsu obata corporationfounder of the honda accord
1 in what ways would you like to see 00 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvementi dont think there is necessarily anything wrong with 00 income more the way it is generated i would love to see ccp look at possibly introducing planetary interaction both of planets involved in the mining of materials as well as creatingtrading of trade goods drug manufacturing definitely needs to be looked at as at the moment its generally underusedunderutiliseda pain the ass to do exploration definitely needs to be looked at to be more interactive continuous exploration via waypoints similar to missionscomplexes would be great mission running in 00 instead of highlowsec should be made more enticing by nerfing high or buffing 00 im just not sure allowing and making it worthwhile to have the creation of semipermanent infrastructure that allows people to actually have a sense of ownership of the space and are developing it rather than just plonking down some towers and an outpost and claiming sov is also high on my list of wants2 how do you see the ability to operate in 00 evolving to improve and keep up with the gameties into q1 3 what improvements would you like to see in 00 as an endgame things to reward players for having made itagain see q14 how would you raise the status of 00 in a productive way to enrich the gameim not sure it needs its status raised its supposed to be lawless space controlled by whoever has the mostbiggest guns5 are you in favour of any role separation or gapfilling with regard to the infrastructure of 00 in the way that the orca will fill a gap and most t2 ships occupy clearly defined rolesnot from a ship point of view but specialised mining pos or planetary colonisingharvesting structures would be cool6 changes to any capitals or subcaps in context of healthier 00i believe the capsupercaps are being looked at by ccp already so that they become more role specific rather than swiss army knives black ops cynos should be able to be created even in cynojammed systems7 any other comments in areas not covered by the questionsnope  how would you make 00 coolermore ice belts see what i did there
first thanks for your questionsfirst i believe the income one can generate from 00 is actually potentially adequate as it is the rats are best in 00 the exploration content is best the minerals are best there too of those things only mining has become unprofitable in order to increase 00 income one has to work on removing the aspects that unbalanced it in the first place mostly in my opinion thats all the automated mining that occurs in lowsec or highsec 00 is and has always been a dangerous part of the game operating in 00 implies more risk more rewards and more fun as long as ccp keeps introducing features pertaining to 00 in addition to that added to highsec 00 should still be operatablenow the idea behind how 00 should operate is fine the mechanics are just plain wrong though pos warfare is dull and limited to cap pilots leaving the others in the dust sovereignty mechanics are terribly broken and limited to pos spamming leaving large swaths of sovereign space actually empty in order for 00 to become interesting for a larger number of people the barrier of entry has to be lowered without nullifying the investment of those already presentin order for 00 to remain the endgame region of the universe things have to remain challenging as things are things are either not challenging and repetitive large alliance warfare or too challenging for smaller alliances reworking the sovereignty mechanics altering the nature of pos warfare and decreasing the immense logistic needs associated with those activities will go a long way towards making 00 more interesting to a lot of people thereby making it more interesting for everyone i believe focusing on the addition of new content in 00 at this stage to be a wrong idea fixing whats already there should be the prioritysee previous answers 00 could also use some variety if only cosmetic to differentiate it from the rest of the universe if youre talking about posoutposts then the answer is no fix these ones in the first placei believe the capital ships fill their roles pretty well as it is some of them could use some balancing naglfar comes to mind most skill intensive worst in terms of dps and tank i believe the nanonerf will go a long way towards diversifying the smaller fleet that are seen roaming in 00 i will miss my vaga for sure in its current form but theres more to gain from a diverse ship makeup in fleet leading to more tactics and less blobingno ill summarize my priorities for 00 modify pos warfare so as to make it enjoyable for everyone including non cap pilots multiple objectives of a non bring dreads and blow everything up nature for instance modify sovereignty mechanics make it harder to control large swaths of space and easier to control smaller parts make smaller gangs viable ease pos logistics needget rid of uniform star backgrounds that look like lowsec would be nice pmeissa
hello alli have a good deal of experience in 00 and alliances but not as much as the big boys in the alliances let me answer these as best i can in what ways would you like to see 00 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvementmy webpage describes some ideas i have for ore diversification and more npc agents in 00 couldnt hurt ore could stand to stretch out the pirates could have a much bigger presence in 00 and some corps such as soe could spread out more too how do you see the ability to operate in 00 evolving to improve and keep up with the gamemore pipes are necessary including more direct jumps into 00 from highsec what improvements would you like to see in 00 as an endgame things to reward players for having made ithave conquered outposts require repairs before becoming active again since it is easier to take over an outpost than it is to build a new one even when the outposts are cheap to start out with alliancewise how would you raise the status of 00 in a productive way to enrich the gamethe guns around gates and outposts is an idea ive had for some time and would like to see it discussed deeper until all the bugs are worked out then finally implimented if a good agreement can be reached are you in favor of any role separation or gapfilling with regard to the infrastructure of 00 in the way that the orca will fill a gap and most t2 ships occupy clearly defined rolessovereignty should mean more such as the gate guns and other concepts maybe a way to open up sovereignty of an area which will allow others to rat and such but still maintain relations perhaps a whole other system security concept where playerbased security can be founded and raised to a good level and will have benefits without affecting the rat population changes to any capitals or subcaps in context of healthier 00supercapital ships are too easy to take out imho they should be a massive mobile station to reward those who eventually achieve the skills and resources to fly one including reprocessing fullyactive clone bays corp hangars etc any other comments in areas not covered by the questionsim gonna put on my fireproof suit now but i dont think you should be able to lose or gain security standing from 00 the benefits are already there and that will require people to enter lowsec making it more of a contested area to raise their security status now pirates simply make a quick jaunt to 00 and theyre back in the positives in no timealso npcs should not drop basic modules but only named ones to compensate their bounty can be increased by 10 except for commander spawns and this will improve the whole game mining will be more necessary when coupled with ore distribution mission runners will have more liquid assets due to the 10 bonus without worrying about reprocessing etc
how do you define which tactics are legitimate and which are not after all its not especially kind to blow up another players hardearned ship and not particularly fair that you can be set back in skill training just because somebody podded you what is too unfair to be allowed into the game in what way should games aim for realism and in what ways should they try to break it  not just in the sense of game mechanics but also in the sense of acceptable actions and cultural norms and most importantly why is your answer to these questions so obviously correct that is should be used as a rationale to ban violators
your antiscamming ideas are as dumb as they are unworkable even if you had the power to implement such promises which you dont lets say one of the eve banks collapses tomorrow  was it a scam or just neglectbad luck are we going to have jury trials for big scams maybe they could keep their account if they pass a polygraph ive never scammed anyone and never will but scamming adds colour and real risk to the universe if you prefer a nice theme park ride of an mmo where nothing ever bad really happens there are plenty of other games that cater for that preference
ccp has measures in place to prevent all employees from doing exactly what youre worried about this came as a result of the whole t20 incident and is why they have their own internal affairs department therefore anytime a command if executed ingame that would create something a log is generated and ia follows up on it if they werent informed prior to its use they have said this much concerning the matter eve online is a truly spectacular game in its whole sandbox attitude at any given moment control of a region can change hands the very economy can be influenced too from jita as the past has demonstrated an example being someone buying all the sales of a specific resource and reselling at a much higher markup the employees of ccp need to play the game and be aware of anyall of the issues first hand any attempt to ban them from player corporations will only serve to isolate them of course they shouldnt advertise that they work for ccp and players shouldnt witch hunt them to find ccp employees in their corps respect their privacy
your opinions on banning scamming and banning people for corporate theft have got to be some of the most pathetic and misguided opinions i have ever heard and i cant believe anyone is actually thinking they can run on such idiocy
you have to scam someone or theive from your corpthere is no way to not perform one of these actionswhich one do you do and why
yes stupidity should always be painful and penalized
lovely tell me exactly what you dont like about the ideas rather then insulting me with personal attacks
how long ago did you buy this character and whos your original charactermain
the character was bought on 20080817 and main is mitsuko watanabe birth 20080713 and i operate in 00 space since around 20080725
the stupidity of your suggestions warrant not bothering to explain anything because anyone worth talking to would understand already but i digress its an idiotic position primarily because you would have gms tied up dealing with whiny petitions by babies who could not properly organize and lock down their assets claiming so and so stole my stuff every time they decided someone had something they werent supposed to haveits not your or the gms positions to mediate every dispute banning people who take things that they can take any ceo or individual with an ounce of intelligence does not leave things around for people to steal and is aware that items that are open to be taken can be taken saying that you would ban people from a game because they dont behave like nice guys and because youre too inept to know who to trust is ridiculous
how did you get the isk to buy this character
gtc trading and a small portion rating
people shooting at each other and blowing up their ships and escape pods is perfectly fine but theft is terrible and we must take steps to ban itahahahaha get the hell out of this game you dumb pubbie
stopped reading after the boldened part i suggest you go back playing hello kitteeh online and take your bright ideas and opinions with you
lol trading the term youre looking for is buying isknice one
still waiting on further clarification regarding questions ive asked you if youre not going to answer at least have the courtesy to inform me so
none of both if i am required to do one of both actions to proceed in the game i would quitthis is not they way i play and this is not the way i live never
i am sorry for the late response anyway internal affairs as far as i know is an ccp internal department but something like that should be done by a neutral outside source to be credible
if you say so but this kind of isk acquisition is legit because i get isk and the other guygirl gets playtime
you still havent answered my questions it was a hypothetical situation thats in direct contravention to what you said above one of ias main tasks is to ensure that devs do not abuse their powers while playing the game normally  ie the assumption is that devs playing is fine and uses of dev powers can be monitored and abuses prevented if you think this is an agency that should exist whether it be internal or external you are presumably accepting the idea that its mission is a valid one  ie that monitoring devs in their play is sufficient to prevent abuses given that this is the exact opposite of your thread title how do you reconcile this
sorry for my late respons to your questionsif your ship is blown to dust in lowsecs or 00 you took the risk willingly if your ship is blown up in highsec because of an ongoing war you could have avoided it but if youUFFFDre getting knocked out in highsec by suicide gankers itUFFFDs unfair but a risk you have to accept except that the consequences for highsec pirats should be greater like faster loose of security standing unability to loot a destroyed ship with an alt or a security status that can drop even lower then 10 and that would take longer to get back to a normal level highsec should be after allmore like a more or less safe haven and loosing your skillpoints in highsec should be removed but again if you enter lowsec or 00 youUFFFDre accepting that riskspying and theft inside a corp isnUFFFDt acceptable for me as is scamming even if some player view this as legit i donUFFFDt this is where realism should end and gameplay should be fun i like realistic games but what use does realism has if it stands in the way of most players fun some players view spying scamming stealing as fun but i donUFFFDt spying playes even greater with emotions of players involved they work with the spy start to trust him and then all of a sudden he betrayes them reallife spies have to face the concequences of their doing so should in game spies real life spiesdeath eve spiesbani see no contradiction here simply because i agree that there should be a department that monitors the staff activity doesnUFFFDt mean that i donUFFFDt want ccp out of player corpsstaff members are still able to abuse their power even if they are not in a player corp
im not sure if youve read all the responses above this post but that pretty much exactly what the ia department means now maybe they can inform on exacly how some formulas work and drop probability but that stuff gets pretty well spaded and the wiki tells everyone realisitcally a well read wiki using eve player would be more sucessful than someone who uses no other source of info other than a dev corpmateplus honestly most ccp employees are in marketing managment support or whitewolf employees programmers are a very small percentage i see no benefit is stopping those people from playing i mean what info can they leek that you couldnt find on the forums in a few days anywayno offence guys you do a great job but i dont see you hax0ring teh gibson 
reposting this so theres no ambiguityi have a hypothetical situation for youyou must either scam someone or steal from your corpyou must pick one of these two options there is no way outwhich one would you pickwhy
yeah it sucks having to do an overhaul but the current pos setup is just plain ugly laggy and a complicated mess firebomb it and start over
this issue was escalated by the csm in meeting 11 and will be passed to ccp for considerationfingers crossed it gives the devs some food for thought
no hes right with faction damage mods and a faction coproc about another 200mil in gear you can shove a dcii as well you can also drop two faction gyros for t2 and use a 3 cpu implant you still need a cpu mod to fit a shield tank your damage is still subpar and your tank is ridiculously cap unstable but it is marginally better i just dont think you should require a capital to spend millions more on an already crappy ship to make it marginally less subpar
i agree with you on the faction mods and thats comparing apples to oranges compare other dreads fitted with faction mods naglfar doesnt shine again right on  more training timeprop goes to you for starting this great thread
i was only able to take part in a few minor events as these were usually ran while i was asleep in bed but those few events were always interesting and enjoyable to be a part ofone of my favorites was simply joining an adhoc gang to escort a freighter across a dozen jumps to deter any attack from the competition of the freighter pilot in the end the only thing the event actors fired at each other were words but it was fun to do it all the same i think i got a few thousand units of electronic parts in payment for my time nothing fancythere were a few others and they always at least for me helped build up the living breathing world of eve i was very sorry to see the aurora shut down and while the coronation video was quite an impressive bit of work i too would have liked to see a great deal more interaction with the customer base over a short flick
it certainly sounds like something that would breath life into eve and im all for that it would certainly provide greater immersion
yes it would be nice but think about the event you remember so fondly and add a 400 man goonswarm or privateers gang coming to crash the party with capitals and all what would have been the result something memorable or a hated massacre without any storyhow many people was really there in elarel 100 players the number of players present in the server has killed that kind of events then there is the people that will scream cheating every time they are not the one getting some profit from the event even if no one was getting any profit from the event ccp dont want the bad publicity of those wild accusation has sometime in the past they had reason to be so some people will take them for real forever so in the end ccp will go for very bland events for now and i doubt it will change in the foreseeable future sad as it would be nice still supported for future developement
i agree on his arguments and his sentiment
yes i do certainly see the issue with a particular large event drawing hundreds of players to empirelowsec wherever of course but then there are remedies take the goons for example  if they come enmasse to empire to disrupt an event that means they are in empire and open to attack from the people maintaining wardecs against them if you tell me there are going to be a couple of hundred goons in x system id be inclined to wardec them myself just for the free kills also beyond the realm of player counterintervention there is the empire sanction  and thats something ccp have toyed with in the past going so far as issuing threats in the name of npc factions but never so far actually doing it i see no reason why you cant have the amarrian empire staging a coronation for their empress and making it explicit in the publicity material that any corporation or alliance attempting to disrupt the event would face punitive sanctions that could involve global standings setting against the organization temp flagging to faction police temp docking restrictions  anything like that and in this way the universe can become more real want try to suicide gank the sarum heir on her coronation as empress sure press the button and take the consequences  and those consequences will hit you and those you associate with yep this will take an events team with the absolute trust of the player base to administrate  but if all event plotlines assets and potential consequences are audited by internal affairs then i have no trouble trusting it will be fair and extremely good for the game of course ccp have worked a wonder getting jita to work properly on a sunday evening  i suspect event fights wont be quite up to the scale of bob vs nc cap slugfests in 00yeah ultimately though  its a headache for ccp aint reason enough for us not to ask for a return to excellent live events that make the game environment feel real and help remind us why eve is a singular achievement in the mmorpg landscape dare to dream is my alliance motto and to be honest it should be eves motto too  these crazy icelanders have got it in them to do beautiful reckless insane things with the mmorpg paradigm and i for one want to persuade them to keep taking risks keep pushing the envelope keep fresh and never grow old i hate the idea of eve becoming part of the mmorpg mainstream of canned mediocrity and on this issue i think its high time we played our part in raging against the dying of the light
when myself and jade agree on something you know that its important and that it makes sensebring back live events
this is a jade wall of text that i can actually swallow with ease and agree on i really miss the live events that used to occur in this game giant thumbs up from me
i approve of this the empyrean age buildup and plotline was just begging for ingame events the lack of them took away from the whole idea imhohopefully next time they try a big plot we will be able to take part more than just within the forums
signed
amen to that
i amen as well
agreeing in a jade thread
full support
lolrpamirightfull support
id love to see more of this too khandro
full supporti did not participate in many events my self but there where actually one where the event actors were calling in people directly from sti to participatei still have hope that the ingenuity and creativity that was ccps trademarks years ago have not been completely lost in corporate mainstreaming
absolutely wonderful idea jadefull and unfettered support
holy crap i have to agree with jade for once vary much supported
as one who has participated in events of the past i fully support this ideathink of the possibilities with the advent of ambulation
signed
supported 100 i got into the game after the events died would be great to be involved in something like thisdoesnt even need to be universe changing stuff with massive rewards either sometimes its the small stuff that gives life to a gameedited for the thumb
yeah supported with whole heart
waitwtf i agree with jade something is very wrong here
supported without a shadow of a doubtnice writeup jadei cant believe i just said that
to quote smash tvi love it always sounded like lyle lovett to me
one of the ironies is that eve the empyrean age the entire recent eve storyline and many many aspects of eve as it is today simply would not be what they are and have been were it not for player events the novel would be an entirely different book had a certain player event gone another way and arguably other player events inform the very background of happenings in the eve universe that make that book and the storyline it is integrated with what they areone of my differences with the many people that bemoan the current storyline is the idea that it is entirely driven by the whim of the writers with no reference whatever to player action in the eve universe at present that is in my view manifestly falsebut there is certainly something to claims that in the future the storyline will have no rootedness in player action except for the dim and distant memories of events in the history of eve that happened as they did because of player actionthe reason for this is that there are no longer any significant ways in which players can interact with the storyline there is no way that players can even alter the manner in which an event plays out ultimately major events will it has to be accepted likely turn out in the end as the storyline devs wish them too one way or another but the realisation that has seeped into the souls of many a roleplayer in eve currently is that not even the details of how the story plays out can realistically be altered or informed by player actionthis is one of the reasons for the paradox of the vastly increased output in eve news items produced by the manifest hard work of writers who are both devs and volunteers having i would have to say less impact and resonance than the occasional pieces of yesteryear in part it is also a phenomenon of the increased output being pumped through a news system that is barely fit for purpose when reams of quality material are being put out daily blink and you miss itbut it is largely also the strong sensation among many players new and old that the news is moving wallpaper the real stories are their own they will continue to make them that i think was never in doubt but it is to the sadness of many that their stories largely are no longer part of the greater story of the eve background or perhaps better to say no longer felt to be part of that greater storyfactional warfare has been a grand success in many ways it has invigorated roleplay and immersion if you like in a way that i actually would argue was not anticipated by many it is however not without its flaws and it has also thus far not met the challenge of filling that gap between player interaction and the storyline perhaps it will perhaps with some events framework alongside it it will be the answer particularly when it is widened to involve many more factions than the big fourone way or another though what the best of eve events stood for and i see no big reason to linger over the nonsenses and missteps that did occasionally occur with events has in some sense been lost maybe this was always inevitable given recent history in terms of the development of the game like jade and others however i think the time has come for ccp to shrug off the chaff of the past and bring back the real substance that wellmanaged events can add to a game like evei know they are capable of it and i also feel that deepdown they want to do it our duty yes duty as players is to impress on them that we want it toosupport this callcosmo
completly support this i remember being bright eyed and new when i was in ushrakhan and wed be called in to liberate some slaves from a convoy i remember how hectic it was trying to find said convoy get the slaves then chase down or block off anyone that was trying to interfere player or otherwise
i agree i still remember one simple little event that i stumbled uponi miss those events

i thoroughly agree with you jade
totally agreed we need more live events more ways which we as players can influence the storylines  or perhaps a way for us to believe that the storylines are a refection of whats really happening in game
ill just say hell yeah and read the fine print laterdid one aurora event and found it fun so
i completely agree with bringing back live eventsi came to eve late so ive never experienced a live event it seems as if ccp has been focusing on scripts to appease the mission runners and then letting the sandbox mechanics take care of player interactioni want to see more events where the conclusion is unexpected by everyone involved the unpredictability of eve online is what makes it so amazing and i think its time that ccp involved itself in the process again
yesit would be nice to see events that also tie into faction warfare a constantly changing set of events would give me a reason to play eve until the hamsters died of old age
i am not really a person who participates in events but they do seem to be important to many players and they do add immensely to the games back story which is something i appreciate supported
nothing engages players or makes a game seem as involved as having the opportunity to influence the very back story the game is based on embracing this idea and making it work would take eve even more strides ahead of other games
a firm yes to this one from me someone who unfortunately never got to experience any of these epic moments except by secondhand reports largely due to me being unaware of the rp side of the gamei remember talking to my first ever ceo as he regaled us with stories of the battle for crielere and just how damn amazing it sounded sure he said there was lag he lost his ship a pricey  at the time  megathron he missed out on loot drops but they were all of minimal note against the fun he had emphasis there is obviously on the fun aspectthe feeling i got from these people whod been there and done it was that by and large it didnt matter if there were shiny loot drops it didnt matter that they lost ships because they felt they were doing something that was directly involved with the backstoryid like to see those days againof course there are things to workaround eves got a whole lot bigger for a start but none of those problems are insurmountable and in my opinion theyre thoroughly worth every ounce of effortsolid yes
i would support this concept but with the understanding that the events would be integrated into existing game mechanics rather than competing with them
i want this a lot
my own thoughts are already posted here but for the sake of a concise thread ill quote myselfstrip away all rewards have the actors ships drop no loot make it 100 about narrative and no finanicial aspects to an event what so ever but let new eden breathe again
hardly a day goes by that i wish that i joined earlier so that i could have participated in such events i would have to say that this has to be done right not necessarily soon give it a year or two run up try various things in test servers any movement on this topic would give some people i know who left the game over time a very good reason to come backi would love to see this thing come again even in a more modest scope
while i do wish ccp would bring back the events from before they do need to do it somewhat differently than they did it before to make sure there is no appearance of favoritism or railroading as there has been in the past there also needs to be realistic consequences for people who take part in these events  standings changes etc  and these consequences have to have a real game effect if you have 5 standings with the federation why can you dock in fed navy stations assuming you can get to them if you have 9 standings with the guristas why do they shoot at you all the time anywayi elaborated on what i think needs to happen before aurora or something like it can come back in jades thread on shc so i wont go back into it here but as far as the idea of bringing them back period yes i really miss the players taking part in the story  or even feeling like they are in the same setting as the background storyline something that seems to be sadly lacking now
this is probably one of my biggest concerns with eve today i miss the old style events
amazingin less than 2 weeks we have over 6 full pages of support for this ccp please do this yesterday
give skill queue now 
still no word on this i take it
seriously ccp this is bull a skill queue is not hard and now that we are literally paying for training time give it
just want to thank everyone in here for there support
the issue was voted on and received support for escalation so hopefully we will get an answer in a month time or whenever the next csmccp session is
definately yes there were a couple of features and ideas discussions about this too but they get drowned out too quickly
after some negotiation i agreed to drop the capital smart bombs element of this proposal from the issue submission and the csm subsequently voted to escalate it for ccps attentionso more fun with smartbombs it is
im against this poorly thought out nerf
i never played back in those days but from what i understand eve is an entirely different game than it used to be new corporations and alliances dont stand a chance at entering 00 as it is mostly claimed by money making logistically soul draining poss capitals are way out of line with the general scale of ships the game has become boring to me unless i have just picked up a new ship to test out
some ideas temporary space distortions aka space weather they move over whole universe and prevent pilots in random constellations from using jump portalscynos mobile space distortion generator can deflectbypass a capital jump probablyvery hard to balance but you got the idea free exotic dancers for every 100th gate jump 
one of the reasons why the i used to do roaming bs gangs in 2004 comments are not relevant to the current speed nerf discussion the ease of logistics both tofrom and within 00 space is one of the major problems of 00 atm but sadly i dont think its possible to solve it without alienating a large part of the eve population
supporting this its an important topic that definitely needs to be addressed by the csm and ccp i hope we get to raise these issues in the last session of the current csm and fingers crossed tusko gets to carry them forward into the next
what youd escribe soudns much more fun than current crap mechanics too bad i couldnt enjoy itmore freighter ganking plz
yes yes yes when will ccp do something about thisobviously a needobviously desiredobviously helpfulobviously ccp is badly managed this is not exactly on topic but i just gotta add that i heard a speech on tedorg by a guy named charles leadbeater look it up the guy talked about some game designer in china with 9000 servers 250 million yep you read it right million players and at any one time 4 million of them are online and the guy only has 500 employeesthe reason for so much loyalty the customers create content its a democracy people want to be involved in the things they lovehow many people play eve at any one time 3000040000 how much say do we get in the game very little ccp is not a democracy  kinda like the us lol ccp listen to your customers
just to clarify look into talk about it but no commitment to take action in any waylikely  a solid maybe in the future a timeframe of infinite value 10 years from now and tomorrow are both in the futureto put it all togetherwe promise only to discuss it but we might do something about it before eveonline fails as a commercially viable mmo but we are not actually commiting to doing anything just that we might do something somedaynow i am convinced that they listen to the player base and that the csm really have an impact on the game in any form i cant see how anyone could deny either of these points given the solid results shown hereso if everyone will please stop referring to the csm program as an ineffective paperthin drama show put on to somehow prove that ccp is responsive to the needs and wishes of the playerbase we can get on with paying our subscription fees and feeling warm inside though a bit poorerhow can you detractors be so blindthe proof is right herethank god or budda or sheep or whatever you flavor of divinity is for csm and ccp for listening and implementing these ideas in a timely fashionoh wait
yuuuuus drone implants ftw
oh yes please cant have them not giving us an alliance tourney this winter
after reading greyscales blog earlier today it came to light just how inappropriate ccps thinking to resolving the scarcity of moon resources is in relation to the game there were so many better solutions that ive read a lot of the ideas and through my experience of 00 and alliance politics as well i have come up with this solutionmoon spawns pdfplease read the entire document before coming to your conclusions obviously its not perfect but imo its a much better idea than whats been proposed before
adding the thumbs up
seems interesting however this idea would be vetoed against the fact that moons are static assets and cannot be fundamentally destroyed in the eve universe case in point look at how ccp said no to the destroyable outposts idea besides once a moon has exploded what is going to replace it sorry i didnt have enough time to read more in depth due to time constraints ill check again later however a more competing idea would be to introduce moons with mineral veins that can be exploited similar how to current real mining operations operate they keep digging deeper and deeper following the mineral vein they want until it vanishes and the mine goes empty or they explore and find another vein likely i think this was similar to abrazzars idea but in any case it lets you know of a fixed quantity available discovered on the moon and once depleted you have to rescan chances are good you will find another vein but in the mean time there should be other types of minerals available to mine at that moon no moon should just have one mineral type and operations would just shift dynamically
yeah you didnt read it entirely it gets respawned next dt and another moon in a 35 constellation area dependent on whether its inner or outer 00 becomes the prize moon which has to be reprospectedand instead of having the veins as you said a pos fires 1 to 4 probes per hour continuously at the moon which controls the abundance of the moon goo
i like your moon redistribution idea i think it could be mentioned to ccp it is the kind of visionary stuff ccp keeps asking for i agree with manford tho that the disappearance and respawning of moons might be technically difficult as they are static resources in game eg galaxy updates systems jumpgates planets moons stations are static as far as i know not something that is downloaded every time you enter a system but this should not block your idea from proceeding tho the technical feasibility of issues is not for the csm to decide
sorry to say but the proposed ideas no good at all it makes things just complicated beyond imagination without any benefit at allit would mean a huge effort and with such an effort i think we could expect a much better resultand well the argument that this proposal is better than the current presented by greyscale is a weak argument because the greyscaleblog is presenting no good ideas at allinstead there should be a semirandom fuzzy set of all moon minerals available at every moon a semirandom distribution over all minerals with a sharp peak in the distribution at the currently existing material the distribution would have random elements but also some predefined distributions based on the rarity of materials this way you would reach an equilibrium of prices while the valuable moons would still stay valuable
you cant expect everything to be served on a platter the idea was more born out of making prospecting a more important profession using exploration as a basis point no one has really too much to complain about exploration so really its no less complicated than that anywayin my proposal there is only a limited increase in the amount of moons but the spread across the galaxy is much more even fairer and controllable than it is now thus making no particular 00 region any better than another equally because moons do go boom and respawn if ccp feel the need to seed more moons its a simple change to implement and thus supply is increasedin all when writing the proposal i speak as a member of an 00 holding alliance a t2 bpo owner inventor and pos chain manager so im looking at it from all aspects of the t2 game a fairer richer and more controlled moon distribution is definitely requiredthe point was that if this is the kind of idea ccp has about solving the t2 market they need a lot of helpthis is interesting however moon goo is supposed to come from the allied faction for example gallente use cobalt and cobalt is available in minmatar space your idea of the distribution creates too much obfuscation between the various quadrants of 00 however both ideas are similar in that when a moon respawns they will have a different distribution anyway
i dont much care for the income redistribution effect  all regions are not created equal even if you normalize moon minerals across a given area you havent normalized regional shapes local rats preexisting infrastructure asteroid belts exploration or truesec distributionso why botherfurthermore i dont see a significant benefit to your idea over than any of the standard moon cycling plans  ie someall minerals just shift around every few weeks new veins discovered in some places while others peter out both still share a lot of needless probing and the only significant positive out of it for alliances is that they can overheat the production  but i think there are better ways to do that as well
hello my fellow eve piloti love probing after ships very muchits cheap and a lot of funbut i have a problem finding something to jump on or giving my mates something to warp on topwhycause most are clever enough to fit cloaksso what has that to do with mewellstructures and sitestatics will move not that much and are no challenge for mei feel kinda useless spending much time in that ship and not finding anyone to play withno matter if bluered or neutralits about interacting with pplno matter if you love probing or hate iti am that boredi started probing t2 drones to collect themdont have to tell that my scanningwindow looked like a chrismastreethat was in highseci dont want to talk ratters or altscouts here cause they are kinda sitting or playing on the same server or do theysolutionmakereward all those pilots who have all probingskills at 5 able to find non cloakers via a probemebby that way we make probing scouting a real and true profsessionthat way we are able to bring more depth and tactics into each pilots lifestimulating highseclowsec as well as 00have to admit that this whould be radicalcold dark and harshand at the same time lots or fun for you and meflame on
there have been quite a few threads about nerfing cloaks in some way or another zulupark has commented on this issue in his forum post
that means quite nothingwhat about finding solutionsbut thank you for giving me heads up anywayyou dont probe do you 
i do my favourit ship is the scimitar and its fitted by a recon probe launcher by default
well i think all will agree that the cost to make a war dec is low 2 or 3 mil wathever is pocket change if your a player with 10mil sp more variations should be there one thing i didnt see suggested from all the obvious solutions is make the cost of wardecs related to the security ratingit would be a simple system you choice till which security you want to wardec to apply war till 5 sec cheap 6 more expensive and make 8 very expensive option
taken from zuluparks qa session where he answered my question about any proposed changes to empire wardecs
thats just your opinionlet face it they claim off ccp that war decleration is this way because of realisme is absolutly bogus no country will allow corporations killing each other over just by paying the police a small handoutif they would want to add some realisme they bribe of the police force in this case concord should atleast be varly extensive and also related to standing of both corpses with that police force size of the corporationsi all for having corps wars but paying 2 mil and start an all out war is just plain rediculous its not a war from country to country thats factional warefare its corporations warefare within a legal boundaryto make an comparison its like paying a hunderd bucks too the police to get a licenses to kill all that have a job at a particular coorporation the maffia would love it but atleast they know thats never going to happenand sins theres factional warefare now i also think that with the added pvp options they corporation war declaration should get some work
not that it really matters small corporations have a simple option to counteract a war declarations just create an executive commander and you have a new corporation for probably about 2 mil or less and you could do this until all possible war declarations are used up if a small corps plays it smart they corps that tries they war declaration will tire easily with only 2 accounts you can totally beat war declaring corporation that just are there for griefing around the bush
and youve not explained the problem with that youre locked into the choice you make because thats the character you are if you made the character with no concern for appearance why should anything have changed why should you get to change the fundamentals race gender bloodline when they already define your virtual character it doesnt make any sense youd get characters who have the attributes of one bloodline and the appearance of anotherwhy destroy all that internal consistency why make yet another bit of the game that time and effort was spent on mean nothing because you think your character will be ugly without even having tried it dont be ridiculous they will never go for this
because ccp is changing the rules on how appearances are defined by adding new parts with ambulationand where did you get the idea that i made this character without any concern for appearance sure it wasnt much of a concern because i dont have to look at the portrait but i still considered it a bitbecause the most visible part that they define will be the ambulation avatar which is the only part where we dont know how our current choices will effect itunless ccp forces us to change attributes when we change the bloodline for the new avatar so that the attributes do fit with the bloodline not how i would do it but it would be an acceptable solutionbecause ccp is changing the rules on how the characters will look and how often we have to look at them currently we dont have to look at our own portraits except on the login screen but when ambulation comes out i expect we will have to look at our own characters a lot which part would that be if other mmos are anything to go by there will be enough people preferring each bloodline to see a fair mix of them around the placei know that almost everyone will find some bloodlines better looking than others even while they disagree on which one looks best unless ccp somehow gets it so that everyone prefers their current bloodline choice letting people switch will please people better than forcing them to live with a decision they made when they couldnt possibly have all the information needed to make the best choiceby starting on this now instead of after ambulation comes out it gives them more time to change and test how it interacts the rest of the ambulation code meaning more time to fix any bugs that crop upand it doesnt seem like it the code would be that hard to write just alter some specific variables stored in known places on the server from one known value to another possibly resource hungry but that just means a lag spike for those parts of the cluster after ambulation comes out until most people have used their one free change
if you want to change your bloodline do you want to lose that ridiculous unbalanced achura attribute set though
you wont have to look at it more than once  when they prompt you to remake your avatar after that you have plenty of choice not to use ambulation as theyve repeatedly stated its completely optional with all the existing station functionality available as beforeif you do choose to use it as you seem to be keen on doing you have to play by the rules and the rules for ambulation would be that its essentially an immersionincreasing environment the idea that your bloodline should match what it was a day before the patch seems pretty logicalwhen you think about it what is the point of ambulation really there isnt one but the actual aim of it is to add a new level of immersion to stations its an rp tool so when you meet someone you can meet face to face you can pretend to drink in a dirty sleazy space cantina why on earth would they break that immersion by changing who you are theyve added it so your face becomes more than that it becomes a persona outside of the ship your response is to say  but in that case i dont want to be me  not reasonable you are you you are not your shiplastly you argument that players did not have all the information at their disposal to make the best choice is bunkum plenty of people have invested months of skill training and practice into stuff much of it unbalanced only to see it nerfed into the floor if they had that information at their disposal would they have made that choice having to deal with changes is part of the game getting to make your decisions again and thus making them inconsequential is not

supporting my own thread at least we would like to have an answer on this aknowledged problem
just a name change makes sense
makes sense
ok seeing as every person is talking here about his own experience and not about general info ill try to put this simplefact 1 why is procurer 1337procurer costs 2 mil to buyyou get 18 mil if you sell it or fly it to caldari space and sell it there so you arent buying a procurer you rent it for 200000fact 2 why is procurer 1337next ship in line retriever costs 6 mil taking into account you just started eve dont have 5 accounts dont sell your naked pictures fors isk seen adds and dont have 600 friends who also play eve that can borow you money you arent realy in a position to make iskibisbantamprocurerstripminerretriever7 500 000 iskibisbantam ospry  that ship you lost on your 1st mission  random stuff here and there  im gona be ima pvper  retriever  more then 10 milto summarize lot of people arent pros lot of people dont have a hauler lot of people think it better to haul stuff back and forth to the station when your cargobay is full then to can it and pray its there when he gets back and so for a loot of people procurer is a nice transitional ship its cheap you can sell it for almoust as much as you bought it if you do stupid stuff you can replace it thats the main argument why this ship is good and should stay the way it isps ill repeatibisbantamprocurerstripminerretriever7 500 000 iskibisbantam random ship you flew after bantam  that ship you lost on your 1st mission  random stuff here and there  im gona be imba pvper  retriever  more then 10 milplus not to mention in this kind of situationshort way of learning skills mining barges 12345long way of learning skils frigat 12345 mining barge 12345all in all if you are going for mining you need procurer cause you cant farm 6 000 000 in a bantam pps prucurer is a minihulk hulks are imba i am miniimba my experience i started eve had a trial account poked a lot of stuff trained all kinds of skills then i bought a normal acount and started ove and i calculated i want to be a miner fastest way to get my skills up and money also is to go straight for mining barges everi other detour just added extra days to what i wanted i couldent fly anything else then a frigate at start so i needed a procurer to farm up enough for a retriver

lol im inclined to agree with you but what the hell chribba is too cool he has done so much for eve and the devs refuse to recognize him as a super power vote chribba permanent head of csm
i think that at the very least as it stands right now the csm serves as an advisory council to ccp one of the things ive been critical to them about is their communication and if it can be taken at face value weve started to see a lot more of that from ccp just in the past month weve seen repeated communications about lag the economy zuluparks talking about p much everything if nothing else i believe at least some of us involved in the last session helped to contribute to that one of the things ive been most disappointed in is the challenge created by forming a council with little to no defined purpose then leaving the council to its own devices to define itself one thing ill say about achievement in order to provide a successful end result one has to have measurable goals to determine achievement the council was never given any measurable goals therefore it is difficult to define achievement in a way that can be accepted by any large number of uniquely minded individuals i can say that it was a success to me and in my opinion others will share a different opinion depending on how they had perceived things to be i think that the second council will be a greater success than the first as there will be fewer growing pains but again having nobody define success leaves everyone to their own judgement on the subjectto be frank im of mixed opinion on one hand i can see that theres a need potentially for some balance but i am always hesitant to take that at face value because nobody likes to get their stuff blown up and the cacophony of complaints from the dead isnt ever the greatest way to measure true opinion on the other hand people like going fast and interestingly enough small gangs have adapted to speed as a way to be competitive which will have a negative impact on guerilla warfare personally id prefer some detailed communication about exactly what changes will be made in advance putting some things on sisi does not equal detailing changes and its no indication whatsoever that any of those changes will actually make it to production that makes it a moving targetmy entire professional career is built around integrity and trust does it make me less honest in my career if i log into a videogame and take someones things does robbing someone in a game make you a terrible person i dont believe so in the least and i know many will disagree to them ill simply say its a game and those are the rules you may think its unfair in baseball that an audience member can catch a ball preventing the outfielder from doing so and costing a professional team a baseball game do you then hate the dude who caught the ball do you hate the ref do you hate the outfielder hate baseball hate rules no you accept that those are the established rules and move on i dont personally engage in any of these pursuits and when i fall victim to them i think man that sucks but i accept them as a part of the game and move on its not my place to tell others how to have fun or what to find fun im not the fundie rules police this is eve online scamming and corp theft is part of it if you cant take that then perhaps youre playing the wrong game id recommend finding a new one rather than raging at the game you chose to play
if by hisec ganking you mean blowing up someone elses ship in hisec then im all for it i dont believe theres room in eve for artificial barriers that cater to the sandy crotches of a vocal and lazy minoritykugu is kugu i think at times his energys misplaced but at the end of the day the dramas hysterical so v0v if what hes doing is wrong its certainly not my place to stop it the developer misconduct was and i do believe remains a potential problem i think internal affairs was the right solution i myself conduct an internal affairs role in my own company i know its not easy and its never perfect however i believe that youre much better off with it than without it people who have in them a real desire to do the wrong thing are going to do it anyway and we have to be careful not to assume that should something negative occur again its necessarily an abject failure theres ways to game every single system and its impossible to be right 100 of the timeyes i do believe it has diminished and i would posit that its actually diminishing nowadays at a greatly accelerated pace i think thats a terrible thing people who played eve and made it what it was wanted that cold dark universe its what truly set eve apart the farther we drift from that the more danger we run of losing the title of something special and becoming just another subpar mmo

fellow playersi would like to announce my intention to run for the 2nd csm i offer myself as a principled candidate  with my core principles includingan evidencebased approach hard facts  hard opinionopenminded and ready to listen to feedback or advice nobody is infallible including myselfproportional attention to different aspects of eve online keep the bigger picture in mind aim to keep eve fun make things simpler if there is no reason for it to be difficulta short bit about the campaign and myselfi am one who like many others has stuck with eve through thick or thin for the love of challenge and variety over the years my ingame experience has accrued firsthand in fields that include several scales of pvp and the odd yarr  factional warfare roleplaying industry trade and corporate leadershipthe bottom line were on one server  to further improve this unique game that we share theres no point in making ambitious plans without thinking of the crucial interactions between the numerous professions and playstyles that coexist eve online is a uniquely constructed game where details and consequences do matter and i care to think about them some may ask well scagga thats all nice but what policiesfocus do you define your campaign bywhile i do have many ideas as to how eve can be improved several of which will be linked later on i feel that it is best to appreciate the general direction the game ought to go rather than remain transfixed to a small number of specific issues im not running for csm to force halfbaked ideas onto the community  im running for csm to see good supported ideas in various fields receive fair attention with eve being such a huge game that is played in such various ways to tie ones self down to a mere handful of issues would not do it justicemy blog which is currently being set up can be found here wwwscaggablogspotcom well not yetideas consistent with my principles will also be included in subsequent posts1 on 00 alliances and corporations2 on roleplaying and factional warfare3 pvp31 piracy32 guerrilla warfare and small scale pvp33 fleet engagements4 on the economy and its markets5 on agents missions and introducing antimetagaming mechanisms6 on the csmextras
a nonexhaustive chunk of viewsideasyes this section will probably develop into a lot of text i have emboldened executive summary statements for easier skim reading1 on 00 alliances and corporationsa particular statement made by a ccp employee that the eve world could be likened to an emerging nation left a lasting impression on me over the years i have watched as huge amounts of work and organisation are poured into maintaining 00 alliances they come and go some leaving legacies that may be talked about till the servers go down at present we know of examples of territory holding alliances that may have developed increasingly complex relationships with those who reside in their space however i do believe that the current mechanics let down many of the people dedicated to building their own civilisation in 00vision enable mechanics for alliances to become more like empires corporations more like business entitiesi support the idea of alliances being given the tools to be able to become more like empires in their own right for instance allowing an alliance to issue its own currency more information about this idea will soon be available on my blog  the relevant link will be the devolution of isk if you are interested to read moreshould alliances be able to issue their own currencyalso i support the evolution of mechanics to help alliances and corporations resemble more a business entity than an arbitrary group of people one that can engage in formal agreements rather than being bound by word of mouth one idea in this likeness is the evolution of treaties such as trade treaties i believe such improvements can simplify adjusting relations between large entities streamlining diplomacy and reducing existing obstructions towards creating rewarding mutual business relations it could also allow a corporation to build an objectively based good reputation based on successful contract work i will soon provide a link to the evolution of treaties idea on my blog for more informationthe evolution of treaties between corporations and alliances is a worthwhile pursuitoutposts rerevisited  a growing number of them continue to mushroom up in 00 helping the taming of the once wild expanses many may remember the passionately held ideas of the last csm chair jade constantine while i believe the idea was not perfect in its original form i do agree that the current outpost system needs to be looked atpillaging stations rather than destroying themfirst let me say i do not agree with the notion that it should be possible to completely destroy an outpost however i feel that it is in variance with common sense that one cannot thoroughly pillage a captured outpost and leave it derelict for someone else to repair up to operable status on one hand i believe that for many it is a landmark achievement to build these outposts and that this should be respected  furthermore that the assets contained should not be made vulnerable to destruction in the same way assets in a pos are vulnerable on the other hand i do believe that a conqueror should not be burdened with a logistics task nor be obliged to delegate it  one ought to be able to remove the useful station functions including docking and salvage minerals or components that must later be replaced in order to reinstate functionality
2 on roleplaying and factional warfareyes ingame i do roleplay an evil ammatar with a penchant for sneaky behaviour  in my view whether you identify as a roleplayer is not important what is important is that players can enjoy themselves if they choose to immerse themselves in the eve worldits about giving people options and supporting themwhile i see supporting enhancements to roleplaying as being under the umbrella of the csm in principle the changes i would support most are those that have a noticeable effect and can provide viable options  for example the concept of hidden pirate agents or even stations in low security space in summary ideas that can give something to a wider variety of playersi would pay attention to working on issues with factional warfare  i have seen the problems firsthandfactional warfare is a concept that was long awaited but currently has much space for improvement i believe my firsthand experience of factional warfare has helped me understand the problems it is facing having served amongst the commanders of the amarr militia for several months i would support ideas that would help make factional warfare matter be more fun  less grindlike more worthwhile through incentives find a workable solution to the exclusion of alliancesother thoughts that have crossed my mind for spicing up factional warfare include militia agents giving assassination jobs against highly productive enemy militiaman loyalty point rewards for completing complexes expandeddiscounted loyalty point stores for higher ranks system capture awards alliance leanings etc that said there is much discussion required on all these topics3 pvp31 piracyive had experience as a pirate in the past and over the years i feel i am not alone in noticing it become progressively harder to enjoy for reasons that may vary from simple mechanics eg warp to zero to the prey becoming more sparse and risk averse eg blobs high sec level 4 agentsetc other than factional warfare i see very few viable attractions that would lure a significant number of pilots into low sec the pirates playing fieldi remember the days when pirate corps seemed more numerous and feared when pirates were a significant concern i must clarify i do not support making it easier per se rather more supportive of new strategies and integrated with ingame mechanicspiracy is a profession that could be more interesting and less lineari would support improvements that would make the profession more varied in activities with game mechanics that can support them for pirates this may include proposing hidden pirate agents in low security space as well as increasing the allure of low security space to attract an increased number of potential targets i would also like to open discussion for probing other potential improvements that can be made in this area
32 guerrilla warfare and small scale pvphaving observed conflicts over time i believe that more should be done to support genuine guerrilla warfare time and time again i have observed as players complain that attempts to raid or engage in small scale pvp are not sufficiently supported eg being frequently blobbed to the stone age naturally it is not anything as simple as this and i could open an entirely new can of worms a most pungeant one actually about nanos but this is not my focus my focus is consistent with my view that alliances should become more like empires and thus it should be possible to infiltrate these empires in an almost partisanesque formmechanics for the longer term infiltration of enemy space need to be supported if guerrilla warfare and fighting behind enemy lines is to be a viable realitythis concept could help spread battles over larger areas promote small groups to hunt each other down as this would be more efficient in eliminating an infestation than the more orthodox reds in my 00 blob them approach i feel this would add a new dimension to empire wars and mean that control over ones territory is not assured by mere sovereignty00 warfare needs battles spread over larger areas in order to promote small group tacticsok that may sound appealing to some well what do i think it could mean i have thoughts along the lines of small deployable bases eg such as independent modules such as defenceless hidden mobile factoriesstorage facilities or along the lines of a new role for a ship eg a new role for certain capitalt3 ships to have a deploy mode like the mobile construction vehicle from cc  i am interested in opening discussion on such ideas
33 fleet engagementsthey are getting to be huge involving multiple alliances at times it is not consistent with my views that eve should encourage bigger and bigger samegrid engagments rather i envision fleet engagements to grow in area covered with remote coordination of smaller groups between group commanders increasinga fleets chain of command should extend beyond the actual members in the chat channel  i envision a commander in chief being given ingame tools to remotely direct the objectives of numerous independent fleets squads or individuals improving the tools for remotely coordinating can help spread forces across more objectivesof the more ambitious ideas i have regarding fleet warfare include the creation of a central command and b visual battleplansit would thus be possible to use an ingame interface to draw lines on the eve map signifying the last known positions and movements of different wings or squads of a fleet in a complex maneuever it can also be used to give different squads their own objectives  eg click on icon representing squad 8 type command and it is sent to the commander of that squad reporting can be done in the same waythis idea can be extended to encompass multiple fleets across several regions this would allow the coordination of massive numbers of pilots in many different locations at the same time the commanders would be able report their position and conditions back to the cnc and thus allow a command structure to become much more interestingexamples of minor improvements to fleet warfare that i would be open to discuss enable motds for standing orders which helps reduce the need to repeat orders if you are reconnecting  joining late allow fleetwingsquad commanders to have a differently coloured text create a merge fleet option to automate the unifying of different gangs supporting the automatic continuation of fire after reloading allow the fc to know the shiptypes of his gangmembers automatically from his watchlist or another ui option allowing him to assess the situation more accurately allow the fc to label aforementioned list with roles if necessary
4 on the economy and its marketsover the course of time i have spent playing eve i have always tried to get the most out of it but exploring the different professions  the one i am currently spending most of my time doing is trading while i enjoy the competitive atmosphere and location location location of trading i do find that there is a lack of control over who you choose to do business with as well as a penury of information that could be available to them some minor market improvements i would propose opening for discussioni support trade embargoes why allow your market orders to sell to or buy from enemies one should be able to starve them out of areas of empire where your tradersfriendly traders may hold dominance i would place such measures under the evolution of treaties ideas that was mentioned earlier the idea entails a small fee similar to a wardec fee to keep it running as well as increased broker fees throughout its tenureii give traders more information quantity and qualitya market search options seller names i would suggest that agents be used to ask on your behalf for a small fee per trade order you ask aboutb the market graphs compare price changes between products ie be able to add more lines to the timeprice graphs distinguish between buy orders filled and sell orders bought from when looking at a products volume of movement on the market tab change it to a stacked columnc map options be able to assess the value of transactions over time in each system by adding another map option be able to assess the quantity of stock available on the market in each system by adding another map optiond support for ipos and investment deals creating mechanics to support ingame investments aiding keeping track of investors and interest payments rather than relying on 3rd party software or webpagese npc shares a little more extreme allow players the ability to buy shares in npc corporations which can be affected by ingame events but also vice versa also affect ingame events

if you had to choose between scamming a member of your ingame corporation gaining their trust and taking them for pretty much everything theyre worth or preforming a corptheft while having access to take everything in the hangers and the entire corpwallet which would you choose whyplease explain in detail
well theres pros and cons to boththe first scenario you build up trust to a single individual and then break it i dont like breaking the trust that i build up with somebody for momentary gainbut in the second case you affect a whole corporation and possibly the work that the members have put into it you dont as much build up trust with just 1 person but rather the general perception people in the corporation has of youits a matter if i would rather want to have to shoot a family member of mine or drop a nuclear bomb on their house you only affect a single individual directly however you kill them instantly but the nuclear bombwhile it might kill them eventually they could survive and rebuild themselves eventuallyi seriously dont like making people sad so im going with neither which is the lesser evil the one you break the spirit of a potentially weak individual the other you dont as much the corp theft option could give you fame and lulz if you are into that kind of thing howeveri will say the first option because its probably a bit harder depending on the person
for those who havent seen it yetthe dead horsethe dead horse  assembly halli only recognize a handful of the csm names lavista vista i recognize thank you for all the posts keep them coming
i liked charlie the first time i know i will vote for him a second timeyou just continue to kick butt lavista we got your back

tip of the day 5back when i was a new guy i joined up with a pirate corporation and did piracy i flew the blackbird in the area around jan in lonetrek it was lots of funsince then i have had vacations from the pirate life where i have taken part in wars like iss vs iac lv vs ra and other fun wars eventually the outlaw life always pulls me backthe life of a pirate is fun smallscale warfare is still very much possible however i think it wouldnt hurt to give much more incentive for people to have people move into lowsec theres a reason why very few people mine in lowsec its simply not worth the risk
as i just described in my tip of the day my piracy background is keeping me interested in eve i tried 00 but the lag and blobs are no fun while lots of good fights are to be had in 00 i just find lowsec to be much betterhowever lately i have been getting into exploration based on discussion we have had on the csm about exploration it has certainly kept me playing much more than i used to do over the summerduring the summer eve was kinda a chatroom for me the community has always been important for me so my average week is likemondaythursday some roaming in lowsec and some exploration in 00fridaysunday lots of pvp with my extended familycorporation
can you enlighten us a little on what type of ships and ammunition you use when pirating how would you rate your understanding of shipfittings and different setups that can be used by eve playerstake carearithron

i dont actually see a lot of difference between your two options  in both cases youre abusing the trust of ig friends to steal their stuff the only difference is whose stuff youre stealing that said in my personal case i am in a corp composed almost entirely of a group of rl friends all of whom are well enough off that we dont really have corp assets if i took the corp wallet theyd crack a joke about me being desperate enough to need a million and a half and then steal a quarter from me irl and call it even i could get way more from scamming their personal wallets but i wouldnt do that to themif i was in a more conventional corp with larger numbers of people who i didnt all know and actual corp assets it starts to depend on circumstances if theres an utter jerk in the corp who has annoyed me ill probably clean him out personally failing that id probably take the lazy way out scam whoever has the worst security provisions and call it a public security announcement on the value of making sure you hold onto your assets if theres one pile of assets far bigger than the others though ill probably go for that  if im severing ties anyways i might as well get as much as i can given that theres no real moral distinction between individual fraud and collective fraud ill go for whichever seems more practical

thanks for the support i suppose if i had to phrase it briefly the best answer is building for the future for a variety of reasons i havent had the time to sit down and do what i really want to  make my corp into something bigger than just a group of friends or move my corpies and i into something that already is  so ive focused on building my ability to do the same in the future part of that is skilling of course part is building methods of providing income and useful assets in futuredatacores researched blueprints etc part is building a reputation through forums and my lottery part is learning about the parts of the game i dont already know and part is making money it sounds a bit weak and i suppose in some ways it is but its what ive been doing
herschel i appreciate the offer to help but my question remains unansweredtusko would you mind chiming in on this im specifically interested in why those two issues which look like imbalance issues are on your list of important firstcycle fairness issues but you suggest that other imbalance issues are not on your first cycle are they on the queue for the second cycle third is imbalance something the csm should be involved with at all you introduced a distinction and i dont understand where you chose to draw the line and would like to understand your thinkingcontrasting your comments with thisand i hope you understand that it is important to me that i can trust your judgment on these issues
sembur i understand your desire for an exact explanation on how i decide whether something is balanced or not but i cant give you an universal formula having played a game a lot you get a feeling on what is overpowered and what is unused and ships and modules being unused or overused is a clear sign that there is something wrong with the balance i would also like to point out that i have only been an alternate during the first cycle i was not in position to put items on the agenda so i was not the one who decided that these issues will get voted upon while others do not all i got back than was the chance to vote whether i see these problems relevant enough to be forwarded to ccp or not tbh balancing industrial ships is nowhere in my list of priorities as for your question whether csm is is supposed to be involved with balance issues hell yeah for sure csm represent players and as the assembly hall shows players are highly sensitive to balance problems in game it is the most common type of issue they keep reporting it would be plain wrong to decide not to represent them of course every csm has a preference on the type of the issues heshe considers to be important and csms also usually have slightly different opinion on balance issues i have been playing this game for 5 years now i am familiar with the smallscale 00 pvp part of the game and also with the big laggy hundreds versus hundreds fleet battles we are doing on max and i think i am pretty good at figuring out whats broken balancewise in these areas on other topics like the crane one which does not have so much to do with pvp all i can do is talk to my supporters got the entire hungarian community behind me from carebears to outlaws ask them for their opinion read the forums do the math or whatever to figure out if a request has merit or not your question regarding my decision to vote yes on these issues can be answered pretty easily as these are a few of the issues that can be proved by numbers the crane is a blockade runner it is supposed to be faster than the other ships because it is a runner that is its main role as it is too small to be a regular hauler i do not know whos spoiled idea was it to give it so little powergrid that even at level 5 skills it is unable to fit a microwarpdrive unlike all the other blockade runners which can do this to be able to mwd or not to be able to mwd is a key factor in case of blockade runners but in case of the crane i had another reason to vote a yes for it i think blockade runners in general do not fulfill their role properly as they cannot actually survive blockades not even simple ones todays 00 logistics are done using jump capable ships as the jump drive is an extremely safe method to haul stuff i am not very happy with it and i think boosting regular haulers in general could counteract the capital usage at least a little bit
the nighthawk is a completely different question i could fly one but i dont fitting it in eft shows already sufficient problems but that is not the reason that made me see that there is a problem with the nighthawk the real figure that shows that something is wrong is the proportion of the nighthawkdrake proportion in pvp situations i did a quick query for you on our killboard with the ship usage stats on these ships nighthawk 1023 drakeferox 99362287 ratio77astarte 1819 myrmidonbrutix 27192762 ratio 249sleipnir 2626 hurricanecyclone 8088968 ratio 225absolution 1470 harbingerprophecy 2139802 ratio 333this is a multicorpmultialliance killboard sample size was 67000 kills with 442000 participations total this figure suggests that there is something really wrong with the nighthawk it not only fails in pve compared to the popularity in drake it is not being used for pvp either so its underused compared to the other races which indicates that there are problems with it passing a nighthawk related issue to ccp serves 2 reasons first it tells them about the powergrid shortage of the nighthawk second and more important it tells them that they should take a look at the nighthawk because the people are unhappy with it i personally would leave most of the balancing to ccp they are better at it than a a few hundreds of players as they are not driven by the desire to get their own stuff buffed however to help the nighthawk getting balanced its easiest to let issues like this pass i hope these answers satisfied your curiosity a little bit i can understand if you wanna see some kind of proof that my sense of balance is right but you have to trust me on this one optionally you can go ask people who know me from longer ago as someone stating that he is okay is not very convincing
capitalism actually does the opposite of entrenching people pure capitalism is an extremely volatile environment like anarchy it is easy to amass assets but very easy to lose them as well just like an anarchy successful entities will seek to hold onto their gains by creating barriers to entry the key is unbiased regulation regulate too much and you entrench regulate too little and the successful will try to control the market to entrench themselveswith that said which path do you feel ccp needs to go down at this point regulate to breakup the entrenched or deregulate to remove the protections of the entrenched

they both require the need to instil trust and confidence in a person or a collective and you could argue that one is worse because of the face to face defrauding and subsequent destruction of your own credibility however in terms of cold hard raw tactics and strategy i believe the implanting of spies and the ability to compromise and even destroy from within should never be taken off the table as an option when faced with a goal or an objective in which such actions deem it necessary the scamming of someone on your team rarely if ever ultimately leads to accomplishing such goals

local chat being moved into a delayed mode could be workable however it must update for everyone at the same time if you jump into a system then either local updates for everyone or it doesnt update for you until everyone gets the update while i appreciate teh desire to gank the  outta farmer ravens you do need to have a tool to defend yourself if say the local scanner updated every thirty second like a radar pulse for everyone at the same time then there would be enough opportunity for good scanners to catch people and yet no so much that they cannot catch anything as is now thirty seconds may be on the high side tbh in  bigger situations it would certainly have varying effects watching local rise as a hostile gang jumps in can give a good measure of their size while if you have to wait for local it gives preset coverts a large advantage in  huge  situations it would have almost no effect from what i can see
yes something should be done however you cant take away what has already been made nor increase the costs for new ones i dont know what the exact solution is but it lies most likely within the power of the doomsday as a brdige tool titans are fineas a gang bonus tool titans are fineas a massive corpship hangar titans are fineas a massive smartbomb titans have an issue eve is certainly becoming more player friendly tbh its hardly hello kitty online new players get a few more skillpoints and some better tutorials i dont see anything wrong with that that about all new players get versus what we used to get if there is something else im missing let me knowas to ccp caving under whining thats an issue with ccps ability to understand how game mechanics work and not to kneejerk to hard in any one direction
would choose neither its not the sort of decision i would ever have to make

as a primarily industrial player i feel that the mining rewards are much lower in 00 if you are doing it for anything more than isk while a decent sized mining operation can clean out the abc minerals pretty quickly compress them jump em up to empire and be 2 billion richer for a rorqual cargo hold full if you actually say want the minerals that come out of those to make something its downright impossiblei dont know a good way to do it off the top of my head but i feel that there needs to be some way to either have rocks that provide more stuff or ships that eat those rocks faster ive always liked the idea of a planetkiller from star trek looking ship that just rules up to one end of the belt and proceeds to eat itive only lived outside of 00 short of a very small amount of time at the very beginning of playing the game the last time i tried to mission was 2005 so maybe things have changed but to me they were pretty boring for me the excitement of 00 is what people make of it i do think there should be the ability to put agents or other empirelike components into the station we shouldnt have to go to empire to get npc only things like pos fuel componentsi dont think there should be any major changes to 00 as a reward for making it because you really havent made it there are areas of 00 space where chinese ratters can play all day and no one knows they are there there are areas of 04 space that if you step foot in youll be wiped in an instant thats to me what i like about the game if you try and turn 00 into the wow raid gold rush it would destroy the gamei dont think 00 needs any status to enrich the game i think there are mechanics of sovereignty and fleet combat that would make it fun from what i can see the population of 00 isnt upset that there arent uber missions with billions in rewards or some ultra rare officer drops its because when they actually try and do these epic battles they showed in the empyrian age ads you get a lag fast and people loose expensive assetschange is good as long as the change doesnt benefit the exploit driven isk farmersi wrote up some ideas a while back with regards to this its a delicate balance you have people with 5 years invested in this game and you dont want to take away all their toys but at the same time the toys create the instabilitiy i think minor changes such as max number of remote reps per ship blobs of capitals causing cyno lock on issues multiple doomsdays actually backfiring onto the titan things like thatfor me the ability for a community to develop their own region free from the bonds of anything is what makes 00 so much fun i would like to see the ability to create the same level of protection for the sovereignty holders that empire and concord offer you jump into a system we dont like you gate guns light you up sure you can get away but you cant sit around either or wander through the sov holders space without being challengedget more people out in it
answering this chaps questions1 in what ways would you like to see 00 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvementi  i would like to see illegal boosters become more attractive options for pilots  make them more powerful in order to increase demand and thus increase the profitability of gas cloud harvesting ive done it and find its a pitifully unrewarding job compared to other forms of 00 miningisk makingii  i am also in support of reconsidering the loot tables for npcs in light of the negative effect that this has on the 00 mining profession2 how do you see the ability to operate in 00 evolving to improve and keep up with the gameplease see my answers to q 373 what improvements would you like to see in 00 as an endgame things to reward players for having made iti  reduce the unnecessary difficulty of certain chores  allow fuel packages to be manufactured from npc pos productsii  i would support planetary interaction but this is already coming soon tm4 how would you raise the status of 00 in a productive way to enrich the gamei would support the rise of treaties i have stated in my campaign thread that i would like to make alliances more like empires i will present this particular idea in a logical formatproblem it is difficult to form formal business relationships with 00 nbsi alliances for various reasons diplomacy for standings and docking rights etc is more work than it should besolution enhance contracts add treaties that can allow for appropriate standings and docking rights etc to be set only for the duration of the contracts activitythis can allow contracts to outsource logistics work ie set a level you would like to maintain stockpiles at and the contract renews every week with whatever amount is required to meet that quantity formalise mercenary contracts or military interventions on behalf of another entity streamline diplomacy ie have some premade treaties available to diplomats to sign with presets analogous to the roles attached to a rank in a corp formalise pet statuseg officialdom for pets official logistics contracts recurring whenever stockpiles are low
5 are you in favor of any role separation or gapfilling with regard to the infrastructure of 00 in the way that the orca will fill a gap and most t2 ships occupy clearly defined rolesabsolutely as i will mention in the next question i am in support of structures that are intermediates between the pos and the giant secure container  ie one can set up disparate undefended modules in 00 space which can be hidden and act as a secret base in enemy held space if the enemy lacks the ability to effectively patrol their own territory why cant it be infiltrated by soft forces6 changes to any capitals or subcaps in context of healthier 00rather than change the actual ships i think that the battlefield should be the focus for improvement i think that 00 warfare suffers from excessive concentration of objectives that force standing armies to mass in a small number of locations this makes for generally less enjoyable experiences when one considers the inability of the server to cope on numerous occasions one of the summary points from my campaign thread was00 warfare needs battles spread over larger areas in order to promote small group tacticsi agree with the idea that the battleship should be considered the main ship of a fleet as such i would support proposals to encourage objectives to be spread out to allow for smaller ships in smaller groups to clash with the massive laggy fleet engagements becoming rarer and less efficientan example of a change based on these principles includes rogue mobile installations eg mobile factoriesmobile storage modules that can be deployed deep into enemy space so that guerrilla groups can operate out of them and cause mayhem in the hinterlands i do not believe that a pos or an npc station should be the only conduit to setting up a base near the enemy core territories7 any other comments in areas not covered by the questionssee the last question for alliance mechanics how would you make 00 cooleri would allow the devolution of currency isk  allow alliances to mint their own currency backed against isk or even the universal average price of certain commodities if i can get my head how that workswhy it can allow an alliance to protect its internal economy from outside interference eg1 hostile forces buy out the marketeg2 alliespets come to competeundersell your alliance mates it can allow the stations to only accept transactions in the alliances currency which will support internal industry and trading giving it an edge over outsiders who mostly have isk rather than the alliance credits it will allow an alliance to pay salaries that can only be spent within the alliance  this may bolster internal trade it allows for very interesting new professions making money from currency exchange  could it allow alliance finance leaders to deliberately devalue their currency to counter corp wallet thefts
1 in what ways would you like to see 00 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvementid like to see more rewards for individual players i may be part of my alliances executive team but i dont reap any financial benefit from it i make my own isk just like everyone else id like for there to be more ways for the individual player to make money beyond ratting i think the notion that ccp bandied about regarding individual player residences a while back has some potential to it especially if coupled with a way to make use of some new form of resources to give even individual pilots some sort of revenue stream id also like to see exploration sites become more lucrative more about this in a bit 2 how do you see the ability to operate in 00 evolving to improve and keep up with the gamesee above 3 what improvements would you like to see in 00 as an endgame things to reward players for having made itfrom the perspective of someone who very definitely hasnt made it the ability to fly capital ships in big fleet battles and score major strategic victories seems like a pretty good endgame to me as does the notion of having sovereignty over an area of space knowing that youre leading an empire in your own right thats pretty awesome 4 how would you raise the status of 00 in a productive way to enrich the gamehonestly i think advertising its benefits could help quite a bit when i was a very new player i had no idea just how great the rewards could be in 00 even in terms of ratting a new life awaits you in the offworld colonies 5 are you in favor of any role separation or gapfilling with regard to the infrastructure of 00 in the way that the orca will fill a gap and most t2 ships occupy clearly defined roles 6 changes to any capitals or subcaps in context of healthier 00black ops i really want to love them and i can envision a few scenarios in which they could be used effectively in concert with recons and stealth bombers however none of these scenarios involve using its special capabilities im looking forward to seeing how that changes with the potential addition of a fuel bay id like to see greater range and the ability to jump into cynojammed systems they could have a serious impact on 00 warfare that way they also need to be cheaper theyre designed to be risked and unlike marauders there is no pve rationale for their existence i cannot justify flying one into combat at their current price point given their capabilities carriers presently these are utterly vital to 00 logistics and im reluctant to see them changed in any way however i could see my way towards rebalancing them more towards combat and decreasing their role in logistics if a new jumpcapable capital ship was introduced to fill the logistics gap before you say jump freighter let me point out that i am thinking specifically of the shiptransport role here it should have a larger sma being dedicated to ferrying ships around and have a jump range similar to current carriers it should have a similar price point to a carrier and be easy for someone who can already fly a carrier to skill for and perhaps be a little bit easier for someone who isnt currently a cap pilot to obtain 7 any other comments in areas not covered by the questionsi think we could use some more 00 space in general as a member of a small alliance i feel pretty hemmed in by the big boys we need breathing room more space particularly close to npcsov 00 where the smaller alliances already tend to subsist because sov is already claimed by by goons or bob or whomever would go a long way to helping the little guys make their dreams of growing come truecontinued
8 how would you make 00 coolera few things id like to see 00 events not many of the ingame events have reached out into 00 space itd be neat to see some plot points happening out there that players can take part in alliance  empire relationships building on the above itd be really cool to see the impacts of 00 warfare on the empires and vice versa right now its like the caldari gallente amarr and minmatar live in this vacuum which has no connection to the warp and weft of 00 politics at all that seems unrealistic its not realistic to think that the caldari state would not take notice of the conflict between bob and the north when some of the major battlegrounds are less than a dozen jumps from jita for example how does the state react enhanced exploration content 00 is supposed to be poorly explored and poorly understood i think the idea of exploration is really cool but exploring in a system that you already know like the back of your hand and finding some randomly spawned site seems a little i dont know hohum i think it would be really cool if there was a sprinkling of unknown territories to explore  hidden systems secret stargates and the like id also see exploration content that was a little spookier and enhanced that sensation of dealing with the unknown mysteriously abandoned damaged ships drifting through space like the flying dutchman lost colonies evidence of the movement of powers we know not wot of that sort of thing exploration was one of the things that first drew me to eve in the hope that it would bring a certain amount of wonder and mystery right now i think its a little boring id like to see it come to life
none of both there is always a different way if i am required to do one of both actions to proceed i wouldnt do any of those a goal that requires you to perform one of these actions isnt worth achieving
answer the question though seriously
what do you figure are the odds of that its about time we stopped bumping this thread i think
if you havenUFFFDt noticed i have answered the question
i havent noticed your answer though i did see you duck it and yes definitely time to stop bumping
i cant agree with you but i see where you are coming from thanks

thank god finally some actionthis one failed to meet quorum and as such it ought properly to be deferred not passedshame on both of them also unless theres a good explanation im disappointed by ank and inanna for causing the deferment above and to some extent jade and lavista for missing other votes of the ten of you only four tusko deirdra bane and arithron managed to hit 16 threads in a week worse yet of the 5 csm 2 candidates with voting rights only 2 voted on all topics and 1 missed entirely pathetic
oi thats pretty harsh since you didnt actually see the actual vote i didthe issue in questionnumber 2 was already addressed by ccp its beyond me why it was voted upon had it not been resolved by now i would have voted i even posted in the damn thread hardin created when he raised the issueits very dangerous to jump to conclusions like that dont do it
i saw variable numbers of votes cast and i wondered who missed votes i did a quick scan of the list and i didnt look at who missed which votes sorry about misrepresenting you thats a perfectly valid reason
not a problem i just wanted to make sure there wasnt any misunderstanding no offense taken or anything
now care to explain the other five of them
herschel i actually showed up for this meeting when it was called last week it was decided by jade then that the meeting would be conducted over forums and email a number of questions were asked and ignored some people simply mailed in votes which i think runs counter to the entire process as a matter of fact i dont believe its the process at all so youll have to forgive me if i didnt meet an arbitrary deadline to cast a fake yes or no vote on topics with little to no discussion when we have a meeting ill be there or provide an excuse when we have a mess of oneway communications youll forgive me if i dont see the logic in the processill also note that the number of posts you make on the eveonlinecom forums is an artificial measure of a csms worth and a farcical one at that
i raised the requisite number of aye votes required when i submitted my votes personally i still think 7 csm members inc alts are required before a vote can be seen as bindingwhere i voted no it was often because the details given on the thread were sparse or required more explanation as i have no access to the csm forum and no further details were mailed i believe not voting for escalation was the correct way to go on a couple issues i voted no due to ccp addressing them recently or in process of eg alliance logosi find the whole system of voting without discussion and the ability to question in a meeting format unsatisfactory i dont like the system and wont be looking to keep using it next csm roundtake carearithron
i see that you showed up which is of course better than those who didnt but at the end of the day youre elected to the csm so that you can help make decisions on these issues not so that you can sit out in silent protest whatever the failings of the process  and i agree there may well be many when its based on votes cast on nonpublic forums with no preparation and from the sounds of it sparse participation  you were elected to vote not to ignore the process the deadline was no more arbitrary than any other and the vote was no more fake than any other your votes were however far more absent in this meeting than in any other as for the number of posts you make on the forums determining your worth i never claimed that it did  i post because i like to not because i think it makes me a better person or a better player im in full agreement with your rationale from a different thread that you dont need to be on the forums to be a good and active csm rep but at the same time i will say that you need to do your duty as a csm rep to be considered a good csm rep you have in past but you didnt here there are better ways to show dissatisfaction than sitting on your hands
it was a suboptimal resolution of a process that was forced on us by failing to reach quorum for 2 straight weeks followed by the weeks of csmccp talks i proposed this as a method of resolving the stalled meeting and clearing the backlog of issues and all csm delegates present accepted the proposalits certainly not a style of resolution i would advocate should be followed by the 2nd csm and i hope for your sakes you wont get into the position where you find it impossible to get a combination of 7 delegates from the permanent members and alternates for 4 weeks in a row messy somewhat unsatisfying and crude but ultimately it got the job done and from my own perspective i did get decent discussion on my smart bomb issue and reached a negotiated settlement capable of getting that proposal through the council other candidates managed discussion on their issues also  ultimately its neccessary for people to initiate talks if they want them outside of the live chat environment in terms of quorum for this vote i assumed that everyone who cast at least one vote was present for this virtual meeting that means that ank jade tusko lavista dierdra bane and inanna were present from the permanent members of the council and since that left 2 empty slots arithrons alternate votes counted too where present delegates are not recorded next to a vote that means they abstained or choose not to cast a vote either way for whatever reason anyway whats done is done and at least weve cleared the backlog hopefully well get people to turn up for next sundays live meeting
there was no silent protest merely the living of a busy life that doesnt lend itself well to hitting f5 all day in a forum on the off chance that someone has answered a question my point was not meant to be that ive protested the vote as i would not have changed the outcome my point was that this was not a meeting nor how meetings should be conducted as there was little to no feedback given and little to no discussion whatsoeverto be frank in order to ignore the process the process must be followed in this case it didnt and theres lessons to be learned from it the deadline was arbitrary in the sense that there was no meeting the meeting that did happen i made time in my schedule to have the vote under question in that there was no discussion and people purposefully ignored requests for feedbackmy responsibility as a csm is not merely to show up and vote to be fair had i not been so busy id have done what serenity did and simply vote no across the board if there was not going to be any discussion hadedit the post sounds far more scathing than it should and i am indeed contrite that i did not merely do the formality of emailing a bunch of yesses and nos but i have a bit more respect for the system as its meant to be than that and am more disappointed with the process than anything or anyone in particular
what is the basis for the comment that ccp has solved this alreay this has been broken for far too long and i have yet to see any feedback from ccp about an eta you escalate planetary colonies and blow this off seems broken to meissler
this devblogbasically shows ccp know there was a problem and are taking steps to solve it ultimately not much else we can do there except say thanks
i may be wrong but i dont think youve used that method of quorum before its always been the assumption that if there arent 7 votes there arent 7 voters and thus theres no quorum its a bit different when the votes are simultaneous versus sequential but it seems like a pretty odd ruling nonetheless if thats how youre doing it though i suppose i cant really object then hit it once a day thats still 7 rounds of discussionassuming theres discussion to be had and thats still a good way of ensuring that you dont miss anything i never claimed it was how meetings should be conducted  it seems pretty clear that it wasnt im not convinced that forums cant work but i will certainly agree that someone will need to think through how its done next time instead of just doing it in a rush but it was the meeting and this isnt a shot at you but if every member ive heard complain about lack of discussion had actually discussed there wouldnt have been a problem purposefully ignored thats a bold statement and was there no discussion on any of the topics also the conventional vote on an unsupported suggestion is nay not ignoring its existence serenity voted no across the board why werent they recorded and while voting certainly isnt your whole responsibility it is part of it fair enough i cant really dispute your rationale the meeting sounds like it was terrible in just about all regards just saying is all
well usually its a matter of beginning the meeting and asking the people in the chat channel to say hi im here and if the total  7 then were quorum the mailin votes offline forum hybrid thing we had to do last week was a different kettle of fish born in necessity the ultimate cause of the problem was simply getting or not getting 7 people in a forum channel at the publicised meeting time for too many weeks in a rowwe have however had situations in the live chat when delegates have refused to vote yes or no and registered an abstain  and that hasnt automatically triggered the end of the meeting due going under the required total of yes or no votes ah well like i said  it was suboptimal but entirely neccessary and absolutely none of csm delegates raised a complaint at the time i proposed this method of resolution in the circumstances
i look forward to your finished product
interesting id like to see those numbers or some evidence of that one for one huh or are you just talking out the side of your neckfor people that are in 5 in higher i think an option to opt out of pvp much like the factional warfare could work not that i think itll happen but it could work
you mean like staying in 05 sec and above
you cant you are eula violator you insulted ccp t0rfifrans by suggesting he should be dismissed from his position and even more so you suggested ccp will cover things up by sending poor t0rfi to rehab so enjoy your 14 day ban and be a good little subscription payer next time and accept what your ccp masters tell you sarcasm off you got for it jinx if they let you now with the forum ban on your record i fully support pos overhaul by the way

i agree with the op i think some sort of review of minnie caps would be goodthe one thing he didnt mention was some kind of typhoonesque split weaponry bonus which would be a marginal bonus at least im sure thats come up in the discussion somewhere there
ok so if this was such a grat idea why was it ignored i would like to see the creation of alliance hangers
even with logs people can take stuffand as gyro said there really wont be a way to limit access to it memebr to member and who would want to in alliances with 300 people would be a pain i do however support the idea in that an alliance hanger of some sort would be good for putting ammo cap boosters and stuff that isnt worth much but very helpful to alliance members
i never got to experience these id really like tosupported
ccp needs to understand that rpimmersion of eve and especially live events will be the main factors that will ensure games future not balancing not graphics updates not lag not ambulation immersion and live events are 1 issue to which ccp managers should dedicate talented thoughtful people
signed this is by far the most important reason for me deciding to join ushrakhan and rp seeing the news stories on these events and peoples participation in them lead me to extend my 14 day trial these events kept me in game during all the tough times they are by far the most entertaining and sorely missed aspect of this game
many times signed
signedambulation is finally on the cards but fw activity is steadily decreasing because of the lack of any real advantages to taking systemsthe rp side of the game really needs some direct ccp involvement to show the community they still care about it otherwise seriously what is the point of all these chronicles and short stories
thumbs up good ideas
yes combined with fw it could make for some very interesting scenarios
agreeing with jade o
anything even close to this would be better than nothing
i support this and so does my altplease please please bring back aurora events or something similar theretothey were something amazing and unique to eve they made the setting come alive they gave the loyalists input from their factions something new to spin their imaginations around and they were open ended  they could go any way based on what the players didin particular the wolves of pator arc was exquisite the npcs had vivid personalities and they acted according to them they were dynamic responding to interactions that crossed boundaries between storylines they wereargh god it was so damn goodas a lifelong roleplayer ive seen stories where the writers thought that affecting the story was simply the potential for players to turn up at a fight as determined by the storytellers and win or losebut in a truly immersive environment you have npcs with goals interacting with pcs and trying to achieve those goals rather than a storyline with highlighted areas where pcs can push or pull the perfect npc cannot be distinguished from a pc in any waythats when you have a living story  more than that not just one story but many of them all interacting with each other and having effects on each other and you can drown happily in the complexityplease please please can we have our wonderful greenies back we loved them very much
i support thisi have never experienced a live event my character is only 6 months old but i find the news are a little  artificial it lacks the ingame events to make the world news more palpable more inline with the playerswhen the titan in luminaire came the first day of empyrean age i made a long trip only to see it in my t1 frigate only to be a tiny element of this universe to maybe be a part of the history but there was nothing more to my knowledge nothing to do and the titan is still here doing nothing  please bring back live events 
this would have been amazing i support this smile
yes yes yesi dont really care if aurora had a bad rep the one moment ill always remember from eve was when uk was holding the muritor vigil and i suddenly take notice of three fleet tempests appearing with a sleipnir arriving a bit later that scene was memorablebring back ingame live events
i have been lucky to be involved in many stories from an escaped slave requesting escort from 9uy to rens chased by slavers to flying with the defiants against the amarrian battlestationsi still live in hope but fear that all those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain
i have never been in a live event but that would be greatit dont have to be epic scale battles to crash servers answering a distress call of a trade convoy can make all setting of eve real and livepleeeease 
yes
this this this
in the name of the t2 cows and the steak saucesigned
supported i didnt have the opportunity to get involved in well any events but they were tasty little vignettes that i would have liked to be part of the closest i got was offering some bms this was before wtz to a freighter pilot he declined as i didnt have a combat ship to hand when i saw the event kicking off but it still has a warm fuzzy feeling about itof course internal affairs would need to oversee a reintroduction of events and care would need to be taken to ensure no corruption would mar this incarnation given that both hardin and jade have expressed satisfaction with the procedures in place following t20gate i am inclined to think ccp runs a far cleaner shop than it didobviously the rewards would need to be carefully monitored as well as the conduct and the events should not merely be shows that can be gatecrashed but must take into account player interaction one constant would be the blue text get lootz syndrome given that event griefing will be inevitable it can be planned for and mechanisms like temporary standing hits or dockingdenials can be applied easily to manage the problemit also seems the sort of thing that white wolf could have a field day or better yet many with they do worldbuilding stuff dont they so perhaps now there would be no need for ohso corruptible volunteers
i think that jade raises a good point here and support it 100 bring back the ingame events ccp please
as ccp zulupark says here they will return soonyes please and thanks 
yes to players affecting the story so long as its done wellmore small events allowing players of all abilities to get involved would be goodmultiple events at the same time so people dont all crowd into the same placeloot shouldnt be a motivator it should be about being able to point to news stories and say i was thereconsequences to your actions if jamyl sarums out and about and you shoot at her you and maybe your corporation should expect to be 10 to the empire and allies for a long long time this might sound drastic but it is also an opportunity for people to say see how hated i am by the empire well i didnt get that way by shooting their navy no i took a shot at that witch sarum herself
karishal and the defiants thats it
thistheres nothing quite like the feeling you get when youre reading about an event you were present at
a topic so near and dear to my heart i do wonder if there is a repository of some sort outlining all of the events that have taken place how many folks were involved in each what the result was in the short term and what the implications were long term the example jade uses is a great one in terms of far reaching involvement by many playersbut its just one of so many new players are being stiffed to be honestemperian age shouldve been a triumphant culmination of so much actionable storyline made manifest through the biggest live event of all faction warfare instead fw is stale and lifeless the precident that brought the story to where it is has been wiped away and we get soundbites to fill in the blanks instead of direct involvement fw needs a lot of other work to be surebut a return of live events would go a great long way to making us feel involved in a living galaxy its like the difference between looking at a beautiful painting ofoh i dunnoa beach vs standing on that beach feeling the wind in your hair the sand in your toes and smelling the salty airdont make us look at the picture ccp bring us into the picture
just like some others i regret that the jamyl sarum coronation wasnt for the players i acquired a navy apoc especially for it to show off but i dont think it would be realistic that those thousands of players could be enjoying regular events by a in comparison limited staffthere is my desire that there would be an event or ultimate mission where the end boss would be a ccp controlled character
not everything can be done ingame but as an ingame or it didnt happen person i do certainly support this
as evanda said i and my alt both support this im too new to have been in on any of the events but well to my mind it sort of comes down to a basic thing i started playing because its the kind of game that im a sucker for but i started getting tired of just shooting things so i started trawling the forums i did a lot of poking around and came across the rp side of things and well its obvious where i went from there i suppose why though the reason i got so excited was the thought that what i could do could affect in some tiny way history i mean look at all of the event results and every so often i hear about other things that shaped how the ingame history went and while im not going anywhere because of the interactions with the other characters the main storyline i dont know i agree with the general sentiment that the news articles just feel more and more flat not poorly written or anything but i remember corp and alliance members going to malaken for the relief or talk about muritor or any of the resta lot of people are mentioning the coronation and i agree about it but another thing like skarkon and the angels prior to the fw kickoff we republic loyalists are sitting there arguing about it icly but oocly theres no scope for doing anything about it so we just get frustrated and then a few days later it resolves itself anyway i mean i love the game and i love the people im playing with but the news and background sometimes seems it might as well be happening in some other game for all i can affect it or vice versa its neat information mostly well written and interesting but i love and play this game
live events again would be a good thing 
heres hoping ccp listens
i never saw any of the live events having taken a long while to get into eve that said the very idea exites me to no end something along that lines would make me feel a part of the game universe as it stands now and especially since the induction of fw i feel nothing less then as seperate from the story as i feel in wow the backstory from eve might as well be put in a book since thats about how much it seems to affect my stay in the gamehowever unlike wow this is perfectly fixable it seems from what the others say and i wholeheartedly support such an endeavor
conditionally supportedlive events performed by organised and enthusiastic roleplayers with no rewards for players beyond the experience and advancement of the plotline so no accusations of favouritism  foul play would be great
supported
supported
while i dont honestly think you could have recreated the awesomeness of the coronation ceremony in game at this point certainly something should have been done
agree whole heartidly i miss all those live events didnt get to see many but was always a nice feeling when i passed one by or read about them on the news reels
support
supported ohowever i would like to see it made sure that theres itleast a chance nonbig names can get involved in this sort of thing if they want to instead of seeing the same names over and over again which you do if you go look at old articlesi mean youll still get all the old players going oh well it was so much better when i started or whatever but still
there was one event that gave me some awesome stuff heres the listwardec from pie that became a mutual war lasting up until the first day of fwwardec from cvawardec from vvalliance with phoenix wingalliance with caffcoalliance with lions emporiumwe were already close with nmtz but they threw decs in support of us and we flew togetherjoint fleets with ushrakhancoordination with fimbulwinterthe chef he really likes freedomthe hedaleolfarber massacre in which cva vv pie and aegis militia basically killed emthe rebirth of em as a fully rp alliancethe chain of events that set in motion the return of gradient to em and our evolution to an immersionist rp allianceeverything else that i have done or has happened to my character since thenthere are two things events can give you that are priceless in an mmorpgsomething new to doa sense of position and definition within the game
i took part in a few minor events and it was interesting to see how the outcome made a difference in the larger ones i fully endorse this product andor service
sounds good
ghost training needs to stay out  to quoteparaphrase so many others  training is part of the game and if you want to play you need to pay
i am about to take some time away from eve but i will continue paying for this game to train skills so gimme a queue please
yep
approved
sounds good to me skill changes during downtime and middle of the night are a bit of a pain
skill queue please
signed get it done ccp
signedsignedsigned one million fking timesi already lost almost 9 hours to the server issues today and still losing timestill cant make it past char selection window and i am still losing valuable paidfor skill training timeso yes a skill queue would be nice
vote yes on question skill queuei often dont even have access to the pc at the times the skills end a one skill queue at minimum is necessary and external access would be great
actually i hope a skill queue is never implemeteduse evemon plan the taining ive never had a problem with with it and i work full timeas for unscheduled downtime well you lose a few minutes or some hours of skill training yes that is annoying but it is not a reason to make a massive change to the way eves training works
got my vote
a skill queue is probably the only thing missing from evethis topic has my vote and i only hope that ccp will implement itvote
supporting this tbh
you have my supportand to walking in station project
signed
omg this is soooo signed
guys and gals dont forget to check the thumbs up if you havent done so yetthx
i am all for itspecially during unscheduled downtimes are it is really annoying
dont care if its a long queue or that level 15 thing or my preference just next skill i just dislike having to run a long skill every night to avoid 3 am skill completions
agreed
agreed a queue would be nice
would be nice
full support
i dont like signing in to change a skill and end up playing eve for hours i am running on caffeine  arghhh pulls hair out
signed
signed
signed vehementlyi may be only a month old in eve but no skill cue of any kind was completely puzzling to me from the very first moment you make a game with the possibility of real time advancement and you actively advertise this feature as distinguishing and advantageous compared to other online environments and then you basically turn it into a major reallife disrupting agent and guaranteed irritation factor all in one by not allowing any form of prescheduling or cueingif ghost skilling was the mainonly reason and its gone now theres absolutely no justification left for this anymoreplease implement skill cueing
full suporting this if not placing secound skill to traine antecipatedly at least we could change it of game in my character division on eve page 4 exemple it would b nice in case of long dt due to seriouse malfunctions that can hapend to anyone even to ccp as we all that use computors know
i support a skill que
i agree
yesfor sure got my vote this is an important basic feature imo i cannot understand how it is missing from a leading mmogeve is not a flawless system it runs on windows servers and mssql ffs  there will be downtime and people will lose time for no reason that and the fact that most normal people cannot always change their skills when required
signedwith shadow training gone its only fair we get something instead besides we are paying for every tick of the clock to train sps so a skill queue would be much appreciated in case of unforseen internet issues curses bt at times  or other that make it impossible to log on and change skills not to mention the peace of mind of not having to stay up late while waiting on one skill or another to tick over before starting a long one for the night
thanks for the update i was looking for the logs of teh csm meeting but gave up
i vote itbut what about all the settingwindows positions size channels folder etc
either this or just store them server side
against the nerf
support
down with the nerf
although i have great doubts about whether or not my post would make any difference i still feel the need to voice my opinion on the matterive read a great deal of posts in this topic but couldnt simply read them all so sorry if someone already posted something similar beforeits clear to me that eve needs a solution for the missing out on sp when a skill training ends during off hours  both server related and personal off hours most of the discussion so far wasnt so much about the need of a solution but more about how to shape the solutioni dont really mind how its done as long as it gets done one way or the othersome of the options are automatic skill rollover to the next level of the same skill skill queue either unlimited or limited sp queue making skill points been queued up for later usemy personal favorite is the automatic skill rolloverautomatic skill rolloversthis includes the game functionality to automatically move on to the next level of the same skill after skill training is completed until the last level of that skill is reachedpros skill training will go on as long as you havent reached level 5 of that skill making it easier to plan skill training for the offhours of sleep work or even vacations would still require players to actively log into eve to change 1 skill training for the other would probably involve the least of programming is easy to understand for all playerscons would allow players to train high ranked skills for months without logging into evei even doubt if the con i was able to come up with even is a con since its no longer possible to train skills while your account is deactivated it means that every skill point trained is actually payed for i think thats what really matters progress in eve isnt solely reached by skill training as it requires personal training exploring and isk making as well to make a good pilotso if someone wishes to train long skills without actually playing the game i dont think that would hurt anybody reallyi think this is the most promising idea of all as its easy to understand and has a natural way of limiting the amount of skills placed in queuecheersdigaph
qfthonestly the thing that always bothers me about threads like this a ccp rep talks about the thing in a way that is almost a borderline flame considering how angry the players are about the issue 7 pages later no one else from ccp has said anything on the threadare they waiting for someone to agree with them that its a bad ideai support a queue hell its the only issue that brings me out of the woodwork these days
tbh all i wanUFFFDt is a skillque that takes 1 skilllike if i train lets say large pulse spec lvl 4 but finishes at 3am in the night the skillque would allow me to que up 1 extra skill lets say the last 10 hours i have in amarr battleship lvl 5 when that skills is done i manually have to set a new skill to trainthis way people still need to login and play but donUFFFDt have to take a deroute off their skillplan
im pretty sure that this boat has sailed  jump freighter owners would be apoplectic at any changes to these mechanics and justifiably so given how many billions theyve sunk into the things  but the vision is a good one the trick is how do you remove jump freighters and jump bridges at least functionally if not literally about the only solution i can think of is creating some sort of conduit sovereignty such that you cant just jump past systems somebody else controls the mechanics of implementing that though are utterly brainmelting and theyd totally mess up legitimate military travel  a jf can slowboat but a carrier cant here is in broadest outline the closest i can come up with to a solution covert travelblack opsbased has jump harmonics 2 military travelcapitalbased has jump harmonics 1 and civilian traveljump freighters rorquals and largecargo ships through a bridge has jump harmonics 0 justify it as civilian manufacturers not investing in expensive military widgets for their cargo carriers  its not like container ships have combatcapable radar irl jump harmonics 2 allows for all sorts of ludicrous things like piercing cyno jammers holding a cloak through jump all that stuff jump harmonics 1 allows for normal activity  bypassing the odd enemy system jumping into an enemy system with no jammer and so on jump harmonics 0 means the path has to be absolutely pristine with no interference whatsoever you might require a module for this effect  a jump inhibitor needing sov 1 with a ly or two of range where a jh0 ship gets stopped by one and a jh1 ship gets stopped by like 5 it means you can still jump caps into border systems even without dropping inhibitors but your jf logistics chain is utterly screwed and in order for the blockade route to work youd need a mobile jump inhibitor too  maybe make a new capital to carry it or stick it on one of the existing supercaps youd basically need to implement a civvy cyno for this to happen without annihilating the jf market so that they still have a use in empire and youll see a lot of enraged alliances at the far edge of space but thats about the only way i can think of to put convoying back into the game without using the nerfbat to break limbs
yeah the more i look into jump tech the more its obvious that if you got all the fuel you need its very easyit would be better if there was a way to buff the freighters to encourage more use of them and give them a chance to break blockades
this is much needed ccpeveryone inluding you gms have a real life i know several people in game who in rl are part of their countries military including myself the way the world is at the moment means long time away from home and without computers its bad enough to get back and find out that the part of 00 you lived in is owned by someone else but then to find that youve wasted x amount of months away you havent advanced in eve at all it would be nice to put two long skills on one after the otherso at least in the months away well have learnt somethingi dont understand why ccp havent implemented this its much needed and they have no comne back as to why they wont implement it so what if people dont play for two hours instead of 30 seconds to skill pop ccp still get their numbers of people logging in people will still play adding a skill queue wont stop people from playing the game for hours on end afking it at work and such it is something that almost 100 of players wantyet ccp havent implemented it how would ccp feel if people just cancelled their accounts whilst they were away losing more members and then people have very little reason to log back in as they have to reactive their accountscome on ccpwhy dont you listen to the paying customers for once
i dont see why this keeps coming up in some form or fashion over and over the whole ordeal seems pretty clearus can we have a skill que please them maybe well look into it and see if it a good thing for ccp and its playersit is what ccp has said again and again whats to ponder you think it is your right because you demand it relax theyll work it out if you dont like the results of the decision vote with your dollarseuros quit seems simplei like the ops spin because he talks about his experience not our experience to conclude if i was waking up in the middle of the night or avoiding my responsibilities in real life to change a skill in a fantasy space game i might have to take a deep look at myself and what is really important in my life
ive read quite a bit into the subject of skill queues and come to believe that the only real reason not to implement such a system is the fact that there are people currently managing multiple accounts just to sell trained characters as soon as they finished training a certain amount of skillsassuming thats the case the following should also be taken into accountive played eve for about 1 month a year ago and stopped playing as i couldnt fit eve into my daily life and seeing the gab between my skills and those of players years ahead of me only grow larger and larger made me conclude eve wasnt the kind of game i was able to catch up inlike myself several friends also stopped playing eve for the same reason and from what ive read many more accounts get deactivated on a regular basis for this reasonnot implementing a feature that would allow players with less playing time to keep up with skill training is costing ccp many accounts alreadynext to that i strongly believe that if its easier to learn skills  read plan skills for longer periods  the need some people may feel to buy a pre made character will drop as well making the single argument not to implement such a feature suddenly weight a lot lessso i totally agree to the need for a queue system in eve one way or the othercheersdigaph
i agree 100a skill queue will not effect my game playing time at all i play all the time and i still find it annoying to have to check skill training times etcwe need a large skill queueeve should have a system that is similar or even identical to what is offered by evemon utilities such as evemon are popular because they are a needed and very useful utility the obvious popularity of evemon should tell ccp that utilities such as evemon are necessary and must be implemented ingame
what dosr of trouble could this cause ugly eve code strike back or what is the excuse now
agree with op the excuse ccp has given just isnt validgiving us a skill queue would be one of the most playerfriendly moves ccp could do there is clearly a demand for this and it was on the drawing board for years yet from the way zulupark was talking suggests that implementation has never seriously been considered please stop brainstorming new reasons why we cant get one and gieve
fully aggree with the opsigned
tourney needs a come back the previous tourneys have made for some of the most enjoyable eve play ive had the build up the weeks before brainstorming setups and then the 23 weekends of the tourney are some of the best memories i have from the game
hell yea the previous tournaments have been awesome
with all due respect what more did ccp expect than pages upon pages of support when they asked the question
looking forward to the next tourney is sometimes the only thing that keeps me playing eve definitely continue with this tradition as its the best video gaming event i can think of i actually know of nonevers who were watching the evetv broadcasts of the tourney with great interest so in addition to being a lot of fun i think its probably also your best advertising
it a daft question eve is a mostly a pvp game the gladatorial combat arena of the tournament is the ultimate test for pvp players and as such is the best showcase for the game there could be
yes
yes
yes plz
thumbs up

supported no prizes but maybe something like the be statue thing outside jita 44
supported
somebody already said itwhy do they even need to ask
absoingloutely
yea obviously its one of the most awesome things this game offers especially to non players who have even the slightest interest it gets them to try it out
yep
supporti never really got to experience one
hell yeah
why are you even asking this
supportin
i cant really imagine an eve without this sort of eventsi definitely want to see more tournaments
yes
word kid
the tournament should be fun for the community not a money maker or large expense for ccp be smarter about it and give the community this great event back its always been fun
no prizes just bragging rights its a fantastic event that most of the community enjoy
the first every nerf im glad about
support
i like most of the changes ccp are planning
i agree a terrible decision the mood of both ig and oog forums is muddled by mixing the two
a pretty straight forward idea a corporation issues a contract that states the following for the bonds in an offeringface value of the bond for example 100000000 isk which would be what the buyer would pay and get paid back at maturitythe time to maturity 10 weeksthe interest and coupon payment so a bond at 65 interest would pay 6500000 per coupona coupon time period 2 weeks so once every other week the bond holder in this example would expect a payment of 6500000 from the bond issuer until maturitycallable period how soon a bond issuer may pay back the principal and not need to make any remaining coupon payouts so say five weeksthere should be no system put in place to guarantee these contracts this is mostly just a way to help those who issue and buy bonds from one another keep track and receive payment it can be taken a few steps more forward in that they could use the current share system somewhat in that a bond buyer receives a item like a share in there wallet which is just called a bond instead and the issuer can just payout their bonds like they do their stock dividends the main difference here is that they can choose to payout a specific set of bonds where as a stock system makes you pay out to all shares of the corporationalso bonds should be able to be traded to help a player run market start up a bell and whistle would be some sort of ratingcredit system so people could know how reliablehonest from past bond buyers a corporation has been in honoring them perhaps just a simple link that shows percentage of yay or nay to a specific bond issuer and the total number they have issued but really people should do their research into whom is issuing a bond and not just go buying these contracts blindly and expect to be paid as this system would just be for the benefit of issuers and buyers book keeping and payment managing not a guarantee of payment on the bond itselfthanks
im entirely in favour of better financial instruments so long as theres no more guarantees than there are at present
not to sound too harsh but im kind of against this idea for the following reasons1 it sounds like this plan would severely increase the number of moons in every system  which means to properly defend an area you would need tons more poss2 it appears to be a logistical nightmare for poss in general which means would be insane to program lets face it here this is a total reinvent the wheel idea3 its really convoluted and is honestly adding tons of busy workccps plan isnt the greatest either as it is going to severely up the cost of the low end moon mineralswhat would have been cool is to take some of the less desired rare moon minerals like thulium and give them some sort of conversion fairly cheeply into the other moon minerals and vice versaalso if supply is the issue upping the amount of those rare moons and moving them around to balance 00 some could also be ideas
definitely a better long term solution allowing some lesser moons to be inefficiently converted to the two coveted moon minerals is only a stay of execution not a permanent fix
this is intentional part of the reason that moon materials are in short supply is that space isnt efficiently moon mined across the entire spectrum of moon materials especially where you have higher value moons it also goes in line with sovereignty requirements since under current mechanics having more poss will mean that the alliance is inherently defending itself against posspam and given ccps idea of changing sovereignty to borders and stargates itd be less of an issue to expand the areas they defend beyond a single constellationonly in terms of producing more probes for running the poss remember this will probably happen anyway with ccps idea of fuel pellets so youre probably going to have to manufacture all the consumables that go into a posso yes there is more work there but the intention of my idea is to move the onus of moon mining from a seriously flawed and considerable annoyance in the managing of the pos itself to the continuous probing the management of the poss should become easier with shorter offlineonline times and larger silo capacities since more work is put into gathering the fuel and more work is done probing the moonsnot really as explained above but the same could also be said when complexes were removed in favour of exploration sites no one really complained about thatwell the idea of one material substituting another is quite frankly stupid what next a few trit and some zydrine replaces morphite its a ridiculous concept for a whole variety of reasons first that theres a fine balance of how materials are used throughout the t2 supply chain second it creates a dangerous precedent and why all because alliances have managed  very admirably so  to create a cartel and ccp havent done anything to scale resources with the number of people in game so the issue of moons all boils down to the fact eve is overcrowded the best idea is to simply expand eve considerably and by expand itd need to be in the order of 812 new regions not just one like black risethis idea creates a mechanic whereby moons can be changed by ccp to balance the needs of the game as a whole if dysp is in dire short supply simply seed more moons per area and because thered be a natural churn of the moons those moons would be seeded transparently and fairly in the game ensuring supply is increased thats the fundamental pro of this idea  it simply provides more options for managing supply
id say spawn more rare moons eve is growing the number of moons arentalso spawn more moons p
well despite what you think this would be a major code change first changing how moons currently work how many moons are in the system randomization of moon minerals how poss work etc etcposs currently are coded to stickbind to a moon if the moon disappears what happens to the pos is it going to offline if so what happens to the defense of the pos if it doesnt offline am i still going to waste the extra fuelprobes every hour even though im not gaining anything from it on top of which ensuring that moons dont get over populated with high end minerals and an even spread of moons throughout the system all of this is going to take huge number crunches at system startup not to mention if a node crash occursand honestly we already have enough troubles with poss not working properly as it isyou are right the general idea of alchemy from one mineral to another is stupid though on the same hand only being able to use one type of mineral is also stupidfor example think if today we still used steel to make car bodies instead of aluminum this game doesnt really factor into substitution of minerals and is very statically coded in the creation of things unlike real life so this is why alchemy or a major redesign of manufacturing is needed
i propose changing the autopilot approach distance to gates to 0 km instead of 15 km it seems reasonable that since ships can warp to gates at 0 km the autopilot should be able to do the same the 15 km crawl to the gate makes using the autopilot too risky in most cases even in high security space pilots are still being destroyed while using the autopilot because they have to approach each gate from 15km along the way please please fix this
im 100 behind you the 15km journey is ridiculous
you have a choice with autopilot  either you slowboat afk or you do it quickly yourself if you have something valuable in your hold i suggest the second route im all for better automation of informationgathering and the like but for actually playing the game do it yourself
i second thatautopilot is an excuse to be lazy if your going to be afk and you have valuables in your cargo hold dock the thing at a station or go to a safespototherwise do it yourselfif the feature was granted people would start throwing a fit about gatecamps and im sure that will go over very wellnot
mmmmm nah the warp to 0 feature was enough lazy besides this is one of those thing that can be argued by role playing ex since your autopilot is an on board system your on board system could malfunction sending your ship straight into the gate blowing you up hence the need for the 15km range for the safety of your pod
whats the general consensus good or bad idea on adding a window to look out when a player is docked in stationi think this is something that could be useful in countering the station humpers  what are they afraid of that someone might fit a ship while inside the station and would go out and fight them
absolutely silly solution but i support a fixmy idea would be making the cloak an insane drain on capacitor for anything other than a role ship ie in order for a nonstealth ship to warp from a safe spot theyd have to be visible for long enough to recharge their cap true if they have some cap injectors they could speed this up but people would have to alter their fittings across the board to accommodate or you could make the cpu penalty higher oh this is fun to think about d thumbs up
today there was an outage that supposedly required a 30 minute outage for eve but then the problems persisted even if eve was off and on periodically it still was not reliable for any players to initiate any largescale in game operations missions fleet ops etci understand theres one hour of each day set aside for daily maintenance however for server problems and other outages that make you shut down eve for a while all players should have their gaming minutes extended in proportion to the amount of time that eve was rendered unplayableunreliable
yeswhen we where able to keep training without an active account i could see not reimbursing game time ccp didnt want to be giving away stuff for free and i agree with that but with unexpected outages we are paying for a service that we are not reciving even games like wow replace time lost due to server crashes please not have worse customer service than wow that would be really bad
read the user rights bit theirs nothing in there about being able to fly spaceships around the tubes of the internet
your given training time for the outage provided your a paying customerotherwise your wasting your timethe only time ill see them compensating us for anything of that nature would be if the game was down for 12 hours or moreeven then your training never stops provided your paying for your accountme grumbles  opme thumbs down
faction warfare is on a spiral downward due to outside influence from neutral corporations and alliances with goals to remove faction warfare corporations we have seen it affect both caldari and gallante militia as corps are leaving due to war decs we believe if it continues on this path faction warfare can and will go away which would be a shame for the new players a few points and solutions to the problems as we see1 no corporation within said militia should be able to wardec another corporation in the same militia this seems simple but has happened if you are in an alliance can you wardec another corp in the same alliance this first point must have been overlooked2 treat wardecs against militia corporations as if you are deccing an alliance if you dec one corporation in any of the mitlitias you are deccing the whole militia with fees inline with deccing an alliance3 in any of the militia high sec if you are an opposing faction you deal with both that militia and the militia npcs if a corporation decs a militia corporation and they choose to bring the fight into that militias high sec the npcs should assist said militia against the agressors4 if any corporation in the militia decs any corporation outside of the militia since they are agressing remove the help and safety of militia npcsfaction warfare is a great training ground for new players and has the potential for great things in the future but only if it survives please voice your opinoins on the subjects posted
i have watched faction warfare go from 60v60 fights  40v40 fights  20v20 fights  current state where i am lucky to see a mixed roaming gang of 5 cruisers and frigates i know for a fact that many of the gallente faction warfare corporations i enjoyed shooting have been targeted and griefed out of faction warfare and i know several caldari corps have as wellto expand on point fourthe militias to my knowledge were intended as a sort of training ground or stepping stone for younger and or less experienced players to learn pvp as such fw should be a more defensive posture to prevent abuse corporations within the alliance of faction warfare should receive no assistance from militia or npc militia if they are the aggressors in a war against a player corp
im in agreement with the general ideas presented here in specific i think 2 is a great concept given that corporations participating in fw are in an alliance with each other for the greater good of the faction and should be considered a single entity for the purposes of wars this should really cut down on the silly attempts to thwart fw in generalvern
establish wardec cost based upon concord standing of both parties cost increases the lower the aggressors standing cost increases the higher the victims standingin addition the act of declaring a war lowers the agressors standingwith concordshould remove a few of the so called random wardecsincreases the risk to the agressorsdoes not prevent wardecs from occurringnote no values given for standing modifiers as that would need to be determined from testing
the current wardec is as random as anything else  there should be established rules of engagement  where the assaulting corp has to state its reason and intent for the war this way defending corp can mobilize itelligently and effectively idustrial corps who do not have fighter types whoudl be allowed to auction off the war to mercs but they themselves should also be considered fair targets and have thier market activity limited for the length of the war thus the desired effect of a resource based war is met curtailing thier productivity also a one sided chain of accountability needs to be implemented when mercs are involved  teh hiring corp must be an established corp with notable assets posstations etc they also be curtailed as far as marketing industrial useage reduced just a rough idea eve is not a nice game and that is what i like about it  just dont like the stupid im bored so lets blow up that pos just cause mentality
its a frigging sandbox game i should be able to blow up that pos just cause or for no reason at all because i choose to its up to players to hand out justice in eve thats why wardecs currently do what they are meant to do and shouldnt be restricted with silly goals or expectations outside of what is communicated with the diplomats of the two warring parties
id prefer to keep my current attributes but if ccp decides that a bloodline change can only come with an attribute change the cost is acceptable after all achura only get 9 across the good attributes all the other bloodlines can get all their noncharisma attributes to at least 7 throw in max learning skills and there isnt really that much of a differencebut the idea that players should be forced to live with a decision they made when they couldnt of known the full effects of it isnt a good game mechanic especially when there is no reason why a one off change isnt possibleand this increased immersion brings people from not caring about their appearance to caring because they have to look at it morewhen i say nerfing skills here i am referring to either a direct nerf to the skill or a nerf to things requiring that skill either way the skill becomes less valuablethe main difference between nerfing skills and the appearance is that when your skills are nerfed you can still fix your character by training other skills you dont need to retrain the skills that didnt get hitbesides what is the largest amount of time lost by nerfing skills months chose the wrong bloodline and your stuck with it forever unless your willing to redo the years you spent on the character including all the training you got right first timealso if ccp allowed people to reimburse skill points every time a nerf or buff came out lots of people would change the things they can fly thus causing a sudden shift in demand thus ing off people who have large stockpiles of the nerfed items because they cant sell them and the people who are already buying the buffed items because demand spiked far too quickly without giving supply time to change leading to price spikesbut by making people train the demand changes slowly giving supply time to react meaning a much more stable market postpatchwhat problems would a oneoff bloodline change cause 
oops delete plz
you should be posting this in the tech support forum not herewe dont deal with hardware problemshardware requests perhaps but not bug fixesyou wont get anything here
unfortunatlly there have been various threads open on this issue on tech forum and bugs reported but it seems ccp is waiting all us throw the card thru the wc so they can forget and stop ignoring the bug this is the only reason im opening a thread over here not otheroh well i can stfu and go buy an other card or not play eve
honesty its not worth waiting around for a bug for a game your having to pay for anywayid toss the card and get a decent high capacity vram nvidia card and be done with it o 
hello all my first time posting an idea here but i just got done reading the empyrean age book by tony gonzales good book btw and there was a part in there that mentioned a technology in use dont want to spoil parts of the book that completely changes the way a person looks ie a caldarian being made to look like a gallentean obviously the game version wouldnt be that robust limit the player to race sex and bloodline like the portrait swap rules maybe a service offered at a few stations that would allow players to add or subtract small details like implantscybernetics that you can see jewelry tattoos etc it would offer players something else to interact with and provide more ways to make your portraitavatar stand out just a thought 
i would like to see the ability to change the background and lighting with out needing to do an entire face swap
be nice to upload own face and use as avatar
changing of the backgroundslighting could also be implemented because i highly doubt that your character would choose to stay in one spot all the time p maybe a feature where you could take an instation screen shot and use it as your portrait once they introduce walking in stations anyway somehow i can already see portraits of drunk players slumped over bars uploading your own face could be fun it would definetly provide that difference from all the other players unless you have a twin maybe they could put it to where you upload your own face and then add tattoos implants etc defintely create your own identity that way
i dont make a habit of suggesting changes to things such as character info etc however it struck me that a last logged in on when you looked at a character in buddy list or just looked at a character that was offline might be useful it might be useful for corp ceos etc to see how active members areanyway post supportsuggestionsproblems etc belowtake carearithron
my first inclination is to say thats too much information but im not actually sure that it is its something you can collate easily enough just by adding them to your buddy list and making notes and this is just an automate version of that i might put on the qualifier of it only showing logons that youve observed via buddy list but aside from that i cant really object now i might argue that the buddy system needs an overhaul to slow down its use as intel but until that happens the grunt work of assembling data should be done by the computer that said for it to do what you suggest for ceos itd have to show the last several logons  they can already see most of the relevant information on the last logon in the corp screen
ive played games that had this feature and i wonder why it hasnt been implemented already signed
pretty sure you can already see this info in the corp management screen
you can well the ceo or anyone with permission can see when a member has last logged in
would you work towards having ccp introduce some corp icons other than more skulls and crossbones maybe some asteroidsrocks and mining looking things thats enough to get my vote
would you support the introduction of new industry icons for corp logos i mean dont we have enough skull and crossbones how about some industry icons asteriodsmining doesnt seem that hard of a thing to do that would be enough to get my vote
well bad enough you made it to csm onceyou only care for one aspect of eve  the carebear side imo every candidate should not only have experienced every part of eve but also care for the balance and the uniqueness of this gameyou dontand i can only hope people wake up and dont vote for you a second timeand btw jade supporting you is everything but advertisement
this is simply untrue i think everyone who has worked with ank on the current csm will affirm she is an openminded hardworking and impressively visionary candidate who is prepared to consider any side of the game and ask many questions to gain whatever knowledge she might lackoutgoing csm chairs congratulations to a hardworking and diligent csm delegate id say that was quite a significant endorsement actually ank has won my respect and ive absolutely no hesitation in commending her to the electorate for a second term
thats just ignorant of you i find her viewpoints on a lot of issues to be rather bizarreits not real if its possible to ever lose it in the future is incomprehensible to me but she does care about pretty much the whole game even if she only really plays one style of it herself
really how do you propose that all candidates experience solo play or joeaverage play with an income of 10 mil a week i also dont see many candidates that are hardcore factional warfare players either or do those parts of the game somehow have less value according to youwhat i think is important is being openminded and the willingness to research to compensate for the aspects of the game that the candidates do not have handson experience withas for balancing i think everyone can agree that the suicide gank rebalance cause thats what youre whining about is it not was done from a gamebalancing point of view instead of a carebear point of view when i was at the real life meet a few days back i had one of thsoe guys whining about me that i nerfed suicide ganking and that he lost his source of easy money as his gank ships paid out more insurance than it cost his alliance to produce them and he would also get fat loot in the process do you think such a system is fine if you look at it from an objective game design viewpointkeep in mind that i said to ccp that suicide ganking should remain possible but it should not be a consequencefree easymoney source which riskaverse players exploitedand funny that you say i supposedly only care for the socalled carebear side but that i have factional warfare sovereignty and 00 warfare mechanics on my agenda you do know im one of the top factional warfare players rightif you think that the current csm people are bad how about running for it yourself instead of flinging mud from the shadows
about fw  im sorry ankh but i feel it necessary to point out that i am running and am an exfactional warfare fc from the amarr militia i have made addressing the ills of factional warfare part of my campaign does that make me hardcore fw 
i suppose it does but youll still answer to your divine commodore ill try to get as much fw things fixed in the little time we have left as i got purpose rewards and goals of fw as well as the complex spawning mechanics on the discussion list for the fanfest ccp meeting now but fixing fw is a longterm process
see you there take carearithron
hey all i want to say that i flew with scagga for about 6 months ish and i must say he is defenitly there for others even if they r red lol my point is hes the person for the job and hell get it done my vote goes to scaggao7
hello scagga re your election campaigni approvehowever i would like your opinion on a few subjects1  how will you make access to 00 space more friendly to casual tourist types i dont mind getting ganked once there but i would like to have a reasonable chance of making it to somewhere deep within 00 without having to use an interceptor to out run all the banks of warp disrupters 2 what will you do to prevent the inequality causing eve to become a voiceist society the you cant join this corporation or other unless you use a voice program mentality must be eradicated not everyone wants to use sound and should not be discriminated against for their beliefs 3 piracy you say what will you do to make the everyday life of the average pirate more agreeable may i suggest a bespoke ore theft ship with the cargo capacity of an industrial coupled with the tank and firepower of saya drakeyou are without doubt one of the real characters in the game today and you deserve your chance on the committee i whole heartedly declare my vote to be yours sirslartix
if i had a second vote it would go to scagga
in regards to your questions1 from my personal experience i would agree that simply getting into 00 can be a challenge there are i would estimate approximately 2030 access points  indeed once upon a time i believe there were even fewer access points into 00 since the last increase in the number of gates the number of pilots has measurably increased so to answer this particular question one approach to dealing with this problem is opening a discussion on whether it would be beneficial for the eve if the number of gates into 00 were increased i have personally sneaked in an out of 00 with varying success  but before concluding that there ought or ought not be more entry points i would take the factfinding approachalso you may have read somewhere in the richly textladen posts above that i do believe that mobile low tech bases would support the infiltration of the swathes of hostile territory that one may be presented with ingame if these were implemented the number of trips required between empire and 00 if acting as a guerrilla would be markedly reduced further reducing the problem posed by the nearly omnipresent gate camp on the chokepoints2 voiceism which i currently understand to mean an overwhelming bias towards a certain voice communication system is a problem whose aetiology lies in the players themselves  one can choose to avoid them for one cannot remove players on these criteria however more seriously if i were to suggest a solution to this problem it would be that the commonly available medium eve voice should be more attractive than the 3rd party programmes that are frequently preferred i am one who rarely uses eve voice having faced problems of lag and liking the ability of remaining connected to a conversation if i decide to log out to summarise the problem primarily lies in the choices of the player but could be approached by making eve voice superior to its competitorssee next post
3 first let me say eve is a hardcore game and coldblooded piracy is part of a hardcore game as you may have read in the original posts i have mentioned that piracy needs to be looked at i have suggested elsewhere that a pirate could have a sort of tactical edge in their home low security space part of this process involves the introduction of highly useful pirate agents in low security space now i know what some may think at this point  agents for my piracyquoting a post i have made elsewhere about integrating pirates with factional warfare and giving them an edge in low sec spacehow about if one were to attain significantly good standings with a pirate faction that they could get access to intelligence reports from the npc pirate via their agentseg within a range of 5 jumps what ships have been sighted in the belts killing our comrades or for more malicious intentions have you see anyone miningthis could spice up interactions with agents and their uses making having good standings with a faction not only allow you to identify with them but to have mutually beneficial relations ie the pirate faction may have an agenda to harrow particular space lanes more intensively to allow for a drug smuggling operation to go about unabated about the pirate agents i mentioned that they should be in ships in space  their locations as well as this hidden bases i mentioned could change with time allowing ccp to direct them to the areas where they can have most fun and have most interaction with their enemiesanother post of mine from elsewherei agree  there is little support for pirate factions in this regard while pirate npcs can infest asteroid belts based out of where exactly there is little one can do to have positive standings unless one ventures to 00 i have previously written about the need for low sec pirate agents  perhaps hidden at moons or stations in low security space that may give players a way of gaining good standing with piratesok what about some consequencesi have thought about this and have suggested that gaining standings with the pirates may include perks such as gaining access to hidden stargates or bases in low sec space which can give them an edge this is merely a concept not yet at the stage of a formal proposal  so i am open for discussing such ideas also i would support the notion of pirate npcs not firing at people with ve standings to the respective faction this can make the infiltration of missions in low sec quite interesting amongst other ideas that i have to move all of the missions with decent profithr to low sec there are a few other ideas that i have spoken about that i cannot recall at this momentright how could this integrate with something like sayfactional warfareit is my opinion that one reason rp and fw doesnt seem to matter is the stark division between pve and pvp activities i would like to see new bridges built where agents could send you on assassination missions for instancean example go kill a member of x militia of y rank or at least z victory points production and bring me his corpse you have 1 week and will receive a certain amount of isk depending on the rank  ship class destroyedto avoid exploitation how about creating other consequences in fw such as losing some  of your rank if you are killed podded and handed in for someone elses mission now regarding the bespoke ore theft ship  my experiences with a dual 400mm plated mammoth armed with a medium pulse laser and small energy neutraliser and topped with a wide array of electronic warfare seems quite adequate
i am afraid i dont have any questions for you scagga since i feel pretty comfortable you would represent my own views better than any other candidate i have seen runninggood luck on the campaign anything you need let me know
lord laebetrovo you have my vote and if theres anything i can do to help you let me know salutes sharplyyama
would you support the introduction of new industry icons for corp logos i mean dont we have enough skull and crossbones how about some industry icons asteriodsmining doesnt seem that hard of a thing to do that would be enough to get my vote
on a side note  vuks wife is not only cool shes also beautifulshe gets my votes but as she infortunately doesnt run for csm ill vote fur vuk instead on a serious notevuk is a great alliance leader and a pretty decent guy he lacks the ego a lot of people in power positions developed hes got a big sense of humor and he definitely cares a lot not only for the people around him but for eve itself and all of eves playersmy name is ugor batarr and i endorse this candidate 
strange but i discussed this with one of my corpmates few months ago i still dont get it why you just can not upload your logo under provided conditions ccp only needs to verify it that logo is not breaking eula or as you proposed just to add bunch of new details after 5 years i am still not happy with my corp logo
with such goods skills both in game and out game i am sure you can be right person to vote for go vuk go
the one and only candidate you should be voting for overqualified for the position imo
youll definitely get my coins
ill give a thumbs up to almost anybody who advocates completely removing doomsdays good luck son
only learned to know him a few months ago when we joined rawr but vuk knows what hes talking about and has some good ideas and points that could improve eve life for all of us  he has the support and votes of me and my corpmagmusmv ceo
while i agree with some of your campaign points and were mostly on the same line when it comes down to 00 affairs i think youre sorely mistaken on this pointyou claim to have experienced all aspects of eve but by saying that it would be fine for corps to wardec individuals in npc corps suggests the oppositewhat exactly do you hope to accomplish with this have you considered those casual players that do not want to be in a player corporation have you considered griefers which would just pick on and extort random helpless players if this system would be put in place it would be game over for any casual solo player griefers would want to pick on as they can run a locator agent and sit outside whatever station hes in and blow him to pieces the moment he comes outand hideout for wardecs the current wardec system is broken even ccp acknowledges that i was there when they called it a paytogrief system apparantly you have not experienced eve from the perspective of a small corporation eitherboth are valid playstyles and your policies do not take them into account how do you plan to represent these people as a csm or do you not want to represent solo players and small corporations
most supercapital deaths have been because one sideor person made a horribly stupid mistake and the other side was in the perfect position to do something about it of the 10 piloted titans to be destroyed only deadtear and oort lost theirs to lagbroken game stuff the vast majority of motherships have been lost to pilot stupidity aswell
i use a wide range of shipsmy killboard tells me that i use these ships the most1 drake2 myrmidon3 dominix4 vagabond5 stiletto6 sacrelidgeand then some other random ships i personally think that i have a quite good understanding of shipfittings eventually it depends on the situation you expect yourself to be in
link us to your killboard page so we can judge your ship fitting skills
currently if someone war decs a corp that corp is forced to participate in that war or disband or use any number of dishonorable methods to escape the wardec mostly due to the fact that most war decs are intentionally to grief smaller corps usually a repetitive process of pay ransom then rewardec them againand againand again nothings to stop them from doing so other than the 48 hour period that comes with the process do you have any suggestions for alleviating this to help smaller corps get survive without ruining the freedom to wardec

i hadnt thought of that but seeing this mentioned i had to log on and check for myself what icons are available yes this is something i would support  a little thing that could go a long wayplanning on a blog update tomorrow expect a mention of this and several other small but very nice improvements i feel could be madealso thank you to che and pete for your support and for helping advertise with the sigs your support is much appreciated

well the csm is completely useless proof  the previous csm did nothing however it is a good mechanism to had out a free trip to deserving individuals and i think vily deserves it on the plus side he is a canuck he lives on pei this will probably be one of very few opportunities to get off the island in his lifetime other than to find meaningful employment he is least likely to become an embarassment to the game unlike the goon candidates of the candidates he actually has an intelligence level to quickly realize that the csm is a joke and that it is part of ccps sick and twisted mentality to play with its userbase not that there is anything wrong with thatit isnt all smelly roses however even though he got me killed when he was fcing  even though he supported mynas wormtoungue during a forum spewage match even though he is misguided at times and joined razor nubletsi will still throw 8 votes his way based upon the participation in the last election it should easily put him in contentionvily enjoy your free trip dont even bother to waste time on plans of grandeur to change eve just nod your head up and down whenever asked a question if ever in trouble use this linei dont have an answer for you right now but let me get back to you with oneworks everytime
its not a suicide question it shows whether youre willing to sacrifice one relationship to keep many or if youre willing to sacrifice many to keep one if you cant answer a simple question on your quest for political correctness how are we supposed to believe youre going to make any difference as a csm representativealso you should well know by now i control more than 20 votes in this election which is sadly more than most people received in total towards them in the first session
bah viper you know the csm has 0 impact on ccp decisions oh correction csms might have some input as to which venue to have lunch dinner would be out of the question for sure at while on their free tripthrow the 20 votes behind him i may throw in some more just to be safe afterall it doesnt look like anyone else on the list is deserving of the free trip bunch of free loaders and emo kids sad to see ccp wasting the money that could be put to more hardware but if they are going to do it at least pick someone who deserves it
dunno if it stops being a popularity contest for epeen whoring they might get something accomplished somedayalso if my subscription money is going to pay their trip to iceland theyre going to jump though my ing hoops to get there amirite
i remember back in april 07 you were among the few to make noise regarding supercapitals being too difficult to tackle because they were unaffected by dictor bubbles even though as an mc member at the time you had the most to gain from not suggesting such a change good luck
blah blah blah simple fact is im not willing to sacrifice relationships its why i play this game your saying would you rather screw over many or few and the simple answer is neither because thats how i play this game i know you control a load of votes but simple fact is once again i wont sacrifice my morals to pander to anyone
the thing is though youre going to have to sacrifice relationships as a csm representative anyway youre not going to be able to make everyone happylets put it this way if a close group of your friends in eve wanted a certain thing changed say the wanted local removed completely and were adamant about having this demand raised though you their csm representative while the vast majority of eve see this as a terrible idea which would influence you more the close group of personal friends that you wouldnt want to sacrifice for the greater good or would you choose instead to represent the majority of the communitys viewpointalso dont get hung up on the removing local issue in fact dont even bring it up in your reply it was purely an example so you could better understand the question
would you support the introduction of new industry icons for corp logos i mean dont we have enough skull and crossbones how about some industry icons asteriodsmining doesnt seem that hard of a thing to do that would be enough to get my vote
sure why not its a simple suggestion and if it makes people happy then it gets my support god knows i have seen enough silver skull and crossbones and circles of stars to last me through the next 10 patches
im running for the 2nd csm mainly on a platform of improving all things scienceindustrymarket related as a member of goonswarm ive done just about everything you can think of scienceindustrymarket related and have become somewhat of an expert on how the game mechanics of that area works even better than ccp sometimes ive previously started and run a small forprofit corporation within goonswarm that is now worth 200b isk as ceo of that corporation i have done moon mining t2 inventionproduction on a massive scale battleship production and now im doing capitalsupercapital production ive run missions in empire ive run missions in 00 ive participated in faction warfare ive been in huge fleet battles in 00 ive played the 01 isk game a lot ive built hundreds upon hundreds of battleships in 00 ive build thousands upon thousands of t2 modules in empire ive ratted ive mined ive hauled stuff lots of stuff more stuff than i care to ever think about againthe fact is if its scienceindustrymarket related ive done it at some point in my eve career and i have an tremendous knowledge of how all of those activities affect each other this knowledge and experience gives me a unique ability to accurately predict how changes to the game might positively or negatively affect gameplay which is why i am running for csm
this guy is crazy about spreadsheets
seeing as trit is one of the biggest component in anything produced and as it stands to get enough trit to build pretty much any supercapital takes over 338 hours time mine the trit but only 24 hours to mine the megacyte do you consider this appropriate what do you think needs to be modified since you can make upwards of 4x as much mining higher end ores which is useless if you have to worry about mineral importation
this woman means business everything he touches turns to gold even 
those numbers sound about right i did some of my own research almost a year ago exactly when they were talking about nerfing npc seeded items that yielded a good source of trit i think i came up with about 10 hours of total mining to build a raven with 78 of them being just for the tritmining is currently a very unloved profession even with the recent additions of the rorqual and now the orca i would like to see mining improved substantially one thing i was hoping to see was a compression line on the orca in zulus thread he mentioned it wasnt needed because there was something else coming that would make it unneeded so im still holding hope for a devblog this week about thati build capitals and supercapitals in 00 my operation relies on buying up billions of units of tritanium in empire each month building a couple different items to compress all that trit  other minerals into a manageable volume then transporting it to 00 to be refined to be built into ships this mechanic is a classic example of how mining is broken and how it needs to be fixeda compression line on the orca would have meant an easy way of compressing empire mined veldspar which could be sold to someone like myself at a nice markup above the mineral cost as itd be saving me a lot of time and effort to compress the minerals via a broken game mechanic
its true im a man irl but play a girl on the internet you should just call me it until i make up my mind
this guy is p chill
00 is a far more expensive place to live than highsec or lowsec you need piles of poses and outposts that are expensive to build and maintain and you need a massive fleet presence to defend it all thats simply not needed in highsec even if a 00 group earns twice what their counterparts do in highsec they may not be any richer at the end of the day and after you compensate 00dwellers for their extra costs it still needs to pay better than highsec to justify the risks involved in living there given standard alliance structures there needs to be income sources for both the alliance and the player taxes fulfill a bit of the former but moons and the like are also valuable things to have around  the idea that theyre somehow illicit because players never see their wealth is shortsighted at besti dont know exactly where changes need to be made or how they should be gone about my knowledge of 00 is secondhand and i dont trust that with detailed balance work like the tweaking of income sources but the above principles are the ones id usea lot of this has been happening for years and is continuing to happen poses and outposts jump bridges and jump freighters have all changed the nature of living in 00 dramatically to the point where established groups have logistics as secure in deep 00 as they would in highsec in some way these changes seem unfortunate  i like the idea of laying siege to a player empire and daring them to run your blockade as you attack their systems  but those days are gone for good and we need to move forwardfundamentally most of the changes that will take place in this regard in future are tied into the ultimate future of soverteignty whatever new objects new tasks and new skills are required to gain and keep space will change the nature of what people are doing with 00 and hence what they need to do to live there i expect it to ultimately look similar to how it does at present but thats merely an expectation as ever the devil is in the detailsi think the biggest reward is already there in a lot of ways  seeing the work youve put in take form you dont get a pimped out character in this game as your final goal you get the right to say that you are a part of an empire that controls hundreds of systems thousands of players and hundreds of thousands of dollars of course you can aim for any goal you like and i know lots who do things other than empirebuild but being a part of something like that seems like by far the most fulfilling on top of that those who truly have made it are generally wealthier than almost anybody else and they get to use the topend ships  capitals  for their intended purposestheres a lot of value in 00 and a lot of draw to go there for anyone who is willing to accept and embrace risks the primary task is to clean up all the bad things that ruin the experience not to create new good things to bring people therestatus in what sense its already respected by players  ive yet to meet a carebear who wasnt enthralled by tales of destroyed titans thousandman battles and the rise and fall of empires part of that is that its a lot more dramatic when you stand at a distance and dont have to put up with lag bombs and the drudgery of standard tactics but part is genuine respect for what happens out there i cant really see how wed enhance that or why wed want toif you meant something else by this question please say so
again this one will largely come down to the effects of sovereignty system changes poses currently do far too many things to be sanely designed for  anything that is factory lab mine jump gate hangar wall fortress and a flag for capturing simultaneously is wearing too many hats and role separation is necessary i dont know which bits will go where  for example will moon miners and cyno jammers continue to sit on the same tower  but the purposes of a pos today will need to be split into two to three structures to restore sanity to 00 infrastructure and this sounds like its roughly ccps plan i cant intelligently comment on what would come after that until ive seen how that works yes titans are completely messedup as a class right now and need a thorough overhaul the best ones ive heard are ewar doomsdays massive tanking bonuses something important for it to do if it remains on grid and possibly an ability to make it a real station while out of combat but i wont claim to be able to define the details of these motherships instead of being built to the wrong purpose seem to just be lacking a purpose  supercarriers are nice and all but a remote ecm burst is not worth 10 billion nothing else comes to mind right now but theres always more tweaking needed nothing i can think of right now the most helpful thing i think would be better corporatealliance management tools people tend to do very interesting things with their space when you let them but the tools arent really there to support a lot of it at present and a playerbuilt tool out of game is going to be less useful for these things than a devbuilt tool ingame give people more useful freeform constructions than just a single 1010 scale and you might start to see more interesting social structures develop

as much as it pains me to bump this abomination even further i have a followon question for yougiven your inability to read and comprehend a relatively simple question your inability to make what is in actuality a fairly simple decision and your reticence in communicating this unwillingness to the rest of the player base why should we consider electing you to a position which comprises mostly of reading ideas and suggestions making a decision about whether or not you feel it would be beneficial to address the issue and then communicating those decisions and the results thereof to ccp and to the rest of the player base
judging from your inability to read or comprehend an answer to a question that was only meant to provoke me into giving you another answer that would have given you the opportunity to say look now heUFFFDs for something he was against i would say  that i am very able and willing to make decisionsand i have to agree this is an abnomination an abnomination of intolerance malevolence and the inability of some enquirer to conform to the most basic etiquette

would you support the introduction of new industry icons for corp logos i mean dont we have enough skull and crossbones how about some industry icons asteriodsmining doesnt seem that hard of a thing to do i see what you said about alliance logos so i thought id askthat would be enough to get my votes
im confused what happened to the alliancesfw issue it seems to have been droppedi note that zulupark made a vague statement in his qa blog but id like to hear more specifics
just to clarify why i didnt vote  since the voting was moved to mailforum voting i didnt feel it was my place to vote as an alternate i assumed there would be ample time for all of the delegates to readdiscuss the issues and vote on them and as i still dont have access to the csm only forums felt i shouldnt be voting on something thata i have seen no csm discussion onb assumed nonvoting by delegates counted as a no voteapparently this wasnt the case live and learnas far as i am aware alternates are only required to vote when delegates cannot be there for a meeting since there was no meeting and this vote was conducted via mailforums imho there was no reason for alternate votes to be usedi think the largest issue that seems unresolved is why the current csm can no longer get a quorum for its meetings it isnt a new issue but it needs to be sorted out asap as currently the situation is unworkable
hey there becq  okay basically i removed the alliancesfw issue from discussion in the last meeting because the response we had back from ccp from the 2nd session meeting basically preapproved the proposal made that we were to discuss fingers crossed the minutes from that should be published by ccp on assembly hall today having been approved by all sides and theyll show that ccp is aiming for a rollout of alliances in fw limited by appropriate standings in early 2009 it was pretty much as uglebs proposal and im pretty happy that the many issues weve pushed in this inaugural csm session have led ccp to the correct outcome in this case
its a volunteer organization  ive seen more important bodies meeting less often that were habitually unable to meet a lower quorum requirement volunteers do not attend meetings reliably be they elected or not its pathetic but its true
thanks for the response i dont see that post now but ill keep an eye outso does this mean that they will be implementing stangings from factions toward alliances and that alliances will join fw as a block based on those standings or do they intend to go with the orginal idea ccp proposed of corps being allowed to join fw using the existing mechanics while remaining in alliances
especially when some or most of them no doubt have day jobs andor school as a higher rl priority rather than the meeting in question being intrinsic to their career compounded by the fact that the group is spread over many timezones
these are actually the two largest factors i think its unreasonable to assume anyones going to have 100 attendance and we all acknowledged that right at the beginning at the end of the day your choice as a voter is always on who will best represent you and one of the choices you have to make is do i mind that the guy im voting for is employed with some rl distractions or whether you prefer someone who for some unknown reason has nothing else to do with their timeboth have their negatives v0v
true but ive always considered it vaguely dishonest to step forward to be on a body and not at least attempt to make every one ive missed meetings before but ive also resigned from a body with two meetings in my term left because i had exams scheduled over both of them  i couldnt make it so i stopped holding a seat that somebody else might actually be able to use i dont guarantee ill make every csm meeting either but i fully expect that i can keep up a higher attendance ratio than the average member did last term never mind the alternates
v0v iirc the average member made most of the meetings i know ive been to all but maybe two and this last round of voting that i oopsed over a 6 month period with meetings ocurring at first every week then every other week after june i simply dont see that as bad i find it pretty unreasonable to expect that over 6 months 9 people are going to be able to wrap their schedules around a mountain of videogame meetings especially when those meetings require a block of an entire day some better management could go a long way to curtailing that

pretty disappointing response imo because there is no recognition still some hope though
an open door to theives and scammers 5 stars for capturing the spirit of eve

totally agree and support statement this game could be even more a lot more glorious
and to stop huge lag issues there could be some kind of ticket system so only a certain amout of people can join then lcck that system off from everybody else
regarding the coronation jamyls was certainly epicbut doriams coronation with deathwing trying to kill him and the sarum ships appearing then being ordered off by jamyl was certainly more dramaticand thats what counts
simple people have told me this will never happen dont waste your time and fundamentally screw that i think this needs to happen and its fully in the interest of eve online for this to happen and as cosmo noted earlier in this thread its very much our duty as players to make sure that ccp hear this loud and clear and are persuaded to make the correct choice over the future of live events on which note  can everyone please make sure they clicked support when posting in favor all the best
nice
signed
make it so
if the draw of events was the possibility of rare loot then dont include rewards unless its fundamental to the story this would also partly deal with the temptation of corruption i would think most players interested in this would be doing it for the roleplaying once loot was removed
or make the loot give no ingame advantagefor example some t2 drones were dropped during a sansha event about a year before they had actually been released however their stats were worse than their t1 counterparts  those crazy sanshasand then we had the signed pax amarrias given out after the impoc escort event  very cool to own but ultimately no more than fluff

i support this some of my best evememories come from aurora scripted events

thumbs up on this one i miss the events they where extreamly fun and most excilerating
yes yes a thousand times yes  and this will be one of my highest priorities if elected to the csm

i never been part of such an event described by jade and i would love to it what really make you feel part of this universesigned all the way
horrendous amount of people who go out of their way to ruin events or just dont grasp them really stinkbut the principle behind aurora and events is too important to throw away for those people
i have already made my feelings towards this change clear in the stickyforumblogwithnoend thread that deals with this plan by ccpneedless to say i am against it and have now already taken steps in preparation to my response plan to cut down from two to one accounts indefinately as soon as my gtc expires on the account in question
thumbs down to the post
oh yea this is so getting my supports 3 year old player here with an alt account around half that age and i still have to switch out skills on both accounts to try and keep from losing training time even though its only mildly annoying the annoyance hasnt diminished over time and having longer skills to trainthumbs up on the skill queue

just giving my ticks of approval if you think 1 account sucks without a queue try 4 0o
i too would love a queue systemit doesnt have to be anything big because anything would be better than this today we had a network outage no big deal it happens  i know i work in it what does suck is that a skill ended when the servers were down this part is what makes the outage a bigger deal than it should bei only lost about 45 minutes so its not really a big deal but it just puts a bad taste in my and no doubt other peoples mouthsghost training is gone so people wont use a skill trainig que to take advantage of it please add a simple two que system it would solve so many things

this would be awesome and would make me more willing to keep playing
i agree skill queue is a must
this is a yes ofcause we need it

aye please may we have a skill queue
if they were stored server side there would definately need to be a way of importing partial configs if i meet up with some mates in town after work and we head to a lan cafe for a bit of eve fun i do not want to try and import my graphics or audio settings since they could be too hardware dependant but i do want all my bookmark folders overview settings window placements and so on imported

31 0102060062 bounty hunting improvementsccp greyscale explained that ccp has had bounty hunting and mercenaries on the todo list for quite some time but that there was always a bigger project that higher priority implementing this properly would consume a large amount of resources and development time and ccp wants to know from the csm and the players how important they deem bounty huntingmercenaries compared to other features such as a change to the sovereignty systemjade constantine believes that bounty hunting and improvements to highsec warfare in general are extremely important for a large amount of players and he supports it fullyarithron and omber zombie think the current bounty system is not very sound and that changes to these mechanics add a new profession to eve and improve empire pvp significantly as well as encouraging players to pursue targets into lowsecdarius johnson believes that compared to bounty hunting the sovereignty mechanics are more in need of change and improvements to this system would benefit a great number of players as welldierdra vaal observed that ccp has requested big picture ideas from the csm and that his bounty hunting  mercenary documents constitute a big picture idea and wondered what ccp had in mind when they made this requestccp greyscale explained that ccp is helped most by general directions the csm and the players wish to see improvements and the avenues they deem worth exploring they also want to know how important the csm thinks this issue is and a prioritization of it the csm does not have to go into extreme detail as this can be filled in by the development team32 0102060063 mercenary improvementssee above33 0102090064 ship maintenance bays revisitedccp clarifies that this change was made because they wanted to stop people hauling stuff in carriers and they still hold this position

i know im like 3 months late for this butahahahahhahahahahahahha if forcing players to log in to change skills is how you encourage people to log on and play then maybe its time you reevaluated your actual whats the word gameplay to encourage people to log in and play wtf
wooooow did they really realise this after only 56 years damn they are fast ffs dudes how much out of touch from their community can the devs be this just leads to show that they have no freaking idea whats going around and have been doing so forever only difference is now there isnt the attantion on the game as it used to be and most of the income is relaying on alt accounts which by the way is like ing in your pants a cold winter day since this more or less deletes the whole idea with the identity and taking a harsh punishment for being a idiot towards others etc etcwell all this is said how hard can it be to set a skill queu that queus up to 24 hours of skills and then leave the last one going which will always be a long skill and then if you get a better idea later on implement it but for now dudes get real and just do something to better the extreme overdue and insanity yer i think it is insane to let something as simple as this which makes so many people so annoyid and properly coursed more then a few to say screw this s i am gone be overdued and ignored in the system as it is now
well thisactually having to be forced to log in is what removes my will to log in every time i have to log in to change a skill it annoyis the hell out of me this means that every time i log in even just to play i get that chill of  i hate this  feeling and gets a bit annoyid untill i am done with the stupid skill changing and can just enjoy the actual game and then it gets back right when i log of and are forced once again to change skill to long time skillsso basically this really discurige me to play and i just got back logged on playid around thought hmm nice then was on for a few days and had to manage the skills and my thought was  start quoteffs this is so freaking ertarded why the hell havent they gotten a skill queu yet what ertard monkey brains are making this  rable end quoteso no it doesnt encurage me to log on actually it discurage me and i have once again cancelled my sub in annoince and rage over the idiocy that have overwelmed the creaters of this system sorry for any and all use of bad languish but it is nessasery to explain the feelings i feel about this subject
i want to be able to set leve 2 and 3 of every rank 2 skill i feel like training and no worry about requeing crap every night i also want to have cyber v finish and start seige warface specialist 4 in the middle of tuesday which is the one day i can barely even log in long enough change skills
im a wow refugee that having read about the ability to continue skill training while not logged in was persuaded to sign up for eve 5 months on im thinking of giving up because of the control skill micromanagement exerts on ones time its starting to feel just like the mindless wow grind im a serious gamer but like others in this thread i have a life outside the game there are enough timeintensive hurdles to separate the hardcore from the alsorans  eg making isk improving standings developing ones space combat skills running a corporation  why maintain a hurdle which requires no skill and next to noone enjoys it doesnt make me play more  unless you count 1 min dropins and afking it for hours on end while im principally occupied elsewhere one wonders how much less lag thered be if people werent encouraged in these silly behavioursthe lack of further ccp input after so many responses is giving me wow deja vu
yes please i hate having to stagger my skill training so the skills end when i can get on sure beats having to go home to change skills instead of eating lunch or setting my alarm at strange times of night to change the skills though
im blastil and i aprove this messagei entered pvp in a corp full of older players and i get an earful about back in the day and ive always wanted to play back in the day heres an idea make jumping inordinately boring i dont know how the ui looks but if your ship is incapped for an hour or two while it flies from point a to point b then i think people will get the message cynoing takes for ing everjump clones ought to remain in place since they do allow for pvp on demand and in fact support 00 logistics growth since you have to move ships too hell why do carriers have corperate bays that can fit ships inside them ive never seen anyone use them to pull a ship out in the middle of combat
to make things more fair for those items that respawn with specific server restarts how about we suggest that ccp change the time of the daily system restart to say 2200 gmt  that way when i get off work here in the us i can come home and log in to eveonline and mine all those nice fresh roids before the folks in the other hemisphere have cleared them out 
if the server reset time was changed to accommodate you then someone else would be complaining about wanting it changed to match them
and its the perfect time for me cos i either get out of bed just before the down time or are about to go to collegeso it lets me change my skill and it wont mess around with any of my play timeso no im sticking with the time it is now
ps ccp is euro time anyway so they arnt going to be doing downtime and everything at about 1011pm
uhhh what why would they go into work at ten o clock at night to do something they do at midday normally just because you want to do some mining and think youre better than people in the other hemisphere
its all about you isnt iti hope this is a troll thread
a better idea would be to move yourself
a cycling downtime would be interesting say 3 hour increments over 7 days and reset to standard time on sundaybut i am fine without that just saying it could be interesting
agreedit doesnt make me play more  unless you count 1 min dropins and afking it for hours on end while im principally occupied elsewhere one wonders how much less lag thered be if people werent encouraged in these silly behavioursi am quite sure that someone at ccp has studied player behaviour and discovered that most people upon logging in fiddle with their skills  some then go on to play ccp has from this drawn the erroneous conclusion that those people were enticed to play by having to log in to change skills such a conclusion is erroneous because there is another explanation for such a behaviour people deliberately choose skills which will be ready just as they log in next
there are currently players corps and alliances yet nothing that is bigger than thatthere are currently a few coalitions in eve between some alliances but nothing to show thisso i prepose that coalitions should be added as another level of groupthis would make it so all the people in that coalition is auto made blue to the other people in it and red to those that are at war wirh the coalition
i think there was a dev blog suggesting they were thinking of doing this awhile back nations  i think is what they called them
signed
that would be coolnot just that but have an go blue 5 status or something you preset for any members of the alliance its always a pain to make everyone do the work when it could just be a do all optionme signed
bring it back pls 
as my brother says
bring it back i want to make a party in my soul food cafUFFFD
stupid doublepost
supporting another tourny
total support
aye bring them back111
yup
ofc
of course that there is something like the allience tornament is a thing that makes eve great i would be very sad to see it go
yes please
10 thoraxi liked watching the tournament
a great endrun around the ui challenges of the contract systemccp sell us a fishing pole well take it from there
its really strait forward and to the point i feel that the sov need of the cyno gen needs to be removed for 2 main reasonscould allow cyno gens to be placed on low sec poss for 00 logisticscould allow cyno gens to be placed on npc pirate region poss for logisticsas it stands you have to fill up you other 2 characters slots and pay for a alt account to supply you with the cyno alts you need to get any capital ship into place as we all saw with the ghost training removal ccp is in this for money and giving us this would remove the need for alt accounts with cyno gens thus i dont see this happening in the hopes that ccp one day starts to care about its player base more then its cash flow i here by submit this proposal for review by the council and the eve communitycol callahan
while your idea is good and fine i would like to think your fellow corpmates would be happy to help you with that problemi see too many players using alts to take care of major tasks that would be most fruitful and constructive for the team work environmenti dont have a problem with alts being scouts but for major operations should have a larger group helping out makes for a really fun gameas for allowing cynos to be built in low sec and what not i dont think thats a good ideaits already too easy for jump ships to roam aboutwould mess up the balance yes iim not a 00 pilotyet but i can see theres a lot there that would take precedenceim going to hold off for now and wait for feedback
hmm well the whole moon issue is probably a sympton of a greater problemeve growing faster than ccp can keep up withalthough as a disclaimer i feel they have done an excellent jobadding more moons wont do it all the more for the mega alliances to swallow up im afraid and precious little chance smaller alliances and corps could access themthe current solution seems to me the most easily implemented and frankly makes more sense that erm traveling moonsit also seems to fit the current story linein war you either conquer more resources or you invent new ways to make em
fixing the autopilot is not so much something that is simply meant to increase lazyness but rather to reduce the downtime that a game like this generates long trips to distant areas of space would be faster if people decide to use it as a way to be lazy then so be it however i would like to point out to those crybabies before they have a chance to complain that the hazards that have always existed when using autopilot gatecamps would still exist and if you are careless enough to zip through lowsec carrying a load of priceless goodies in your cargohold by autopilot then you deserve what you get repairing the autopilot feature should only make it more useful not replace the need to actually play the gamefly safe
no you want to be lazy and stupid then be lazy and stupid at 15km
the thing is if autopilot warped to zero a lot of small ships would be uncatchable by the average gate camp you align too quickly for them to click on lock on and scram and youd land on top of the gate coming out of warp and thus jump instantly also autopilot doesnt slow you down set destination use it as a route planner and fly yourself  assuming you pay attention your time will be exactly as good as a user of the improved autopilot what you suggest is that it all be doable afk which i dont support
warp to zero was implemented to reduce the bookmarks more and more people had to reduce lagif you want to travel fast you have the possibility to warp to 0 manuallyif you want to go per ap you have the drawback of needing longerit is fine as it is  ap to zero would be over the top imhogreetings belmarduk
good idea but would tax the system a bit more and even then your just indulging in your paranoiai have mixed feelings ill sit back and wait a bit first
i dont like this due to the fact id sit outside a station watching docked players mooning me whilst camping
while it would be nice its prob impossible due to the fact that the station is on a separate server to the exterior environment
yeasounds silly but i love the ideacould have not posted that at allbut i am sick of itwhat would you do if you are that dedicatedi dont nanodont fly capshipsdont own a posdontt build stuffare people that afraid of a covopswhy we dont get a step furtherrequirements for probing noncloakers all at 5  cloaking 5you get rid of all wannabealts 15 probingskills right awayreward dedicationthere is no need for more new mods or skillslet the pro probers handle the problemdo we have some wise csm guys with an opinion on that matteror is that iron too hot
brilliantlets see 15 dolars a month on average of course thats about 50 cents a day system is down or laggy for a couple of hourslemme do the math herechaching heres your nickelfail move along to the pampers isle please
or lets see 58 cents or so per customer multiplied by tens of thousands of subscribers  a fair incentive for ccp to be on top of their game and to make anticipatory upgrades so even that would be nicebesides read the damn post  the request was not for money back to customers but game time extended proportionate to when the game was down that skills continue training is a pretty meager aspect of gameplay if we pay for 2 months of gameplay at a time we should actually get 2 months of when we can log in and play the game
what a ridiculous whineyour argument proves how facetious the request is  you point out its a tiny amount per player but across the whole player base its quite a lot for ccp so why would they incur a big loss for themselves while not really satisfying anyone individuallysometimes a bit of downtime is unavoidable we all live in the real world and know that these things happen your complaint is just a tiny scion of the ridiculous compensation culture we have at the moment  had an accident sue someone for money game down for an hour or two demand more time
oh noes i lost 10 cents
it seems like they are on top of thier game there really is very little downtime ever read the dev blog they are constantly improving the system they employ patches and anticipate most problems they usually let us know if there is going to be extended downtime am i missing somethingwhy some players create this adversarial relationship with ccp is a mystery to me if you think your being cheated quitfail againand i offer one more time an escort to the pampers isle
compensation culture how about just being a smart consumer and making sure you get what you pay for if i pay for 60 days of game time i want to actually have 60 days when i get to log in and reliably play the game i do the same thing with my internet bill if the internet is down for 2 days straight i ask that my bill be adjusted to reflect that i did not get a full month of internet my wife and i also just signed a lease but we are moving in on an odd midmonth date the rental company prorated the rental for us for the days of the partial month that we will be there the point of being a savvy consumer is actually getting what you pay for if you think it is unreasonable for consumers to seek this then you are just a toolfanboy of the companies and business that you slavishly hold dear and ive got some 59 and 58 day gtcs i could sell you fro 3499 you dont mind right
i agree aswell i do not speak for anyone other than myself
if u remove the ability to wardec a corp in militia how do u respond to blue on blue piratingin a normal alliance that would result in a corp ejected from the alliance is there a way to resolve that issue without wardec is ccp going to police this as a normal ceo of a large alliance would cant see it 
i have seen the fw decline first hand as well my corp has also been involved with a war dec that was intended to force us out of fw prety simple tactics the decing corp just waits for a fw fleet then picks off its targets with out a worry of bring on the full blow of the fleet this loop hole in fw will be its undoingmy only twist on this would be that if you are a corp and you join fw you should lose the ablity to war dec and as your now in a larger alliance only the alliance should choose the corps to war dec so if a corpalliance wants to get involved with fw corps they have to war dec the fw alliancesure this opens up new players to more potential danger when a corp war decs the fw alliance but its much better then sitting around a battle going on where you cant do anything but shield rep your fellow fw pilotsas for blue on blue aggression that should be kick from fw imho maybe a rank drop system there instead to the lowest rank then kick a typical ceo would not stand for it so that should be the norm maybe give the corp the option of kicking that player from its ranks with in 24 hours but if that players stayss then kick that corp from fw
thats gold  ccp how about it
fw was always supposed to be a small gang pvp introduction the decline of fw is really it doing what it was supposed to do it wasnt supposed to be 60 man blobs it started off as beingmaking wardecs alliance wide is dumb now instead of harassing a handful of corps in fw a 00 alliance can harass the whole damn thing
i think this needs a bit more finesse in the aggression enginethis would work for both a corp outside of the militia and within the militia1 you can only wardec a single corp in the militia not the whole milita just like now2 if you aggress a pilot in the militia corps that you decked you become flashy for 5 minutes to the whole militia3 once other militia fire at you you can shoot back at them with no sechitconcord but not before they do thatthis would solve the problem where decked corps players are not safe in mixed milita fleetif there is a griefer corps joining a milita and most of the militia aggrees that they are a bunch of s they can still be decked within the milita and attacked since the rest of the militia would not come and help them
i agree 100 we need to do somethign quick before the milita is completly dead
your really going to try and say that faction wars was ment to be small time really you cant get any more cooler then hundreds of random players forming up to fight for their causeand come on really 00 alliance dont war dec they dont give a dam about conncord and when they do get upset they put up a pos in low sec and gate camp a system coughtamacough killing everything that happens to wander through
definite support especially point 3 ideally would need a separate fix for blue on blue pirating
i agree fw can be a blast its a great way for players to test the waters of pvp in a casual setting i think that we should make an effort to find ways to keep people interested in fw i think at the very least if you are in a mixed fleet and someone attacks a member of your fleet that they have war dec on then the fleet should be able to fight the aggressor this is not to say that the whole militia should be your blanket security but it doesnt make a lot of sense to be in a mixed fleet and have a group of pilots able to pick off a couple of targets in the middle of your fleet and not be able to do much about it i want to see something that is not slanted in favor of either side but fun for everyone
a little bit of tweaking as some of the other posts above and thisll be a great idea
what a great idea
its fine as it isnot supported
something needs to be done otherwise i fear fw may come to an end sooner rather than later fw was my first taste of pvp as it has been for many other pilots and it is a great idea to get us carebears started in the fighting please dont let this fall apart ccp
some clarification on this point are you proposing that it will function exactly how wardeccing an alliance works now ie if multiple people wardec said alliance the price escalates or will it always be the default 50m a week price no matter how many entities wardec corporations inside the militia its an important question because if there is escalation it will quickly reach untenable levels of expense making the militia an effective waravoidance mechanism and thats not in the interests of the gamealso can you confirm that you mean if an external entity wardecs any corporation inside a miltia they will be in a full status of war with all militia corps  the militia npc entity for the wardec fee paidthanks
i agree the wardeck on militia makes for bad game playthis needs to be fixedso like the snl dude fix itbut it easy to see why some fw corps have made the wardeck choice fly through old man or tama and you get to dodge the 20 10 players from different corps that have moved in to feast on the younger players trying to have a chance of any fun in fw pvp thus it was an easy bet that fw corps would bypass the low sec issues and take the fight right to the systems fw stages fleets in once this started it snow balled into all out wardecks even within ones own militia its all about targets i too have seen a large drop in fw battles and players due to this ccp needs to take a responsible approach at keeping the game fun for all players is this what you had in mine ccp should something you added to the game to help fun for mid level players be ruined this can be fixed and fast please doone wayfaction war needs its own space with bubbles and bounties a must for killing apposing side player shipsnot many players care about the plexs the risk to reward sucksdo this and fw will be a big part of the fun for mid level players againthe 10 players and want to be pirates can go find real targets that have real skill in low sec
confirming this is a heap of fun
that would be the only acceptable change but i dont think you realise what you are asking for militias would be a very popular wardec target
rabble rabblerabble rabble rabble
i agree that something has to be done for me fw was the way into pvp wasnt interested in it before but fw and wardecks together isnt so much fun
so you deck a corp from each on the alliances and you are in war with all the fw alliances works great for me 
wooot that would work out wellit will be like the new privateers well tought out ideas steel
not a bad idea skaxx if u war a mitia corp it would be good to have the whole militiaalliance good bonus since we ward u guysthe sad part is that it will protect bad word like u guys and so on 3 in any of the militia high sec if you are an opposing faction you deal with both that militia and the militia npcs if a corporation decs a militia corporation and they choose to bring the fight into that militias high sec the npcs should assist said militia against the agressors is a bad idea why should u have an atv vs wts but this is from usif u should leave militia we ill still war steelhow come u never undock from station to fight its same as in the militia just that u dont have 4000 ppl helping uits just funny to see how mutch  u could put out in the militia channel when the war wassnt active and now nobody see guys annymorewell ofc not counting when ur stabbd up for travelstop whining undock and fight
this post has nothing to do with the mentl dec the apb dec or anarchy now decs we have this post was due to the corps who are griefed out of militia we are a mostly us pst time based corp we are not going anywhere we believe in the militia and will continue to move forwardthere are plaguing problems in faction warfare and we do not want it to go away of course their have already had flaws pointed out in a few of my points which is good the more points of view a discussion can have the better
ofc it has to do with us were the only corp in militia that has decced you and isnt that what this whine post is about getting decced by own militia
do i think it is ed that a corporation in one militia can dec another corp in the same militia yes we started this post for the shear lack of war targets we see anymore when we starting checking these corps weeks ago as they were leaving one after another was decced by multiple corporations we do not want our opposition to go away if it wasnt for all the good pirate corps around there would be nothing to shoot at at all in our timezone we formed our corporation knowing we would get war decced alot oodin you are a greifer of the worst sort at least pirates have the balls to show their colors you choose to shoot your own militia and have done so for the last few weeks taking advantage of game mechanics and the fact that most militia pilots are new players i can respect pl coming into tama and camping the system or bydi or veto as they show their colors you join fleets with the sole purpose of shooting your own you hide behind your own militia to grief the newer playersi do not know if any of our ideas are worthy but something has to be done or we will have no war targets to shoot at in black rise i think this would be a shame faction warfare allowed me and many others to find fun in pvp
suchs bull when empyraen age was released ccp itself told in some interviews that there moving away from the sandbox concept for all ereas except 00 they going to lower they learning curve and making more focus on the mission part and production part in there next expansion if you want sandbox stay in 00 are go play another game because ccp is going to ruine it for ye anyway
doesnt look like ittaken from zuluparks qa session where he answered my question about any proposed changes to empire wardecs
this says it all if you can not protect yourselves you do not deserve to be in a player created corporation or alliancethe corporations i have belonged to only seem to war dec the following corps or alliances1 mission runner corporations who flaunt their wealth by flying faction fitted ships in front of us spread the wealth man2 corporations that say stupid stuff in local and irritate one of our members if youre going to have a big mouth then you need to back it up3 alliances that irritate our ceo by kicking him out for griefing shooting people in high sec what else is there to do in high sec
im conserned about adding objective to the wardec mechanic eve is a sandbox making set objectives and goals is a way to force gameplay styles on players i say no
as stated beforeif you dont have a pos that needs defending and is part of your corporation and your corporation is less then 50 members there a very easy trick that makes they wardec totally uselessjust make an new char make it executive commander itsa starts with coorporation management lvl5 and ethnic relations lvl4 make a new corporation and moce all your members to the new corporationthey will make the coorporation that declared war an you stuck with a war against an empty coorporation for a weekccp already has added enough an different levels that you just cant call it a sandbox game anymore in high security space with the recent changes to concord it has become a regulated game for people that are smart enough to take advantages of the added mechanismealso holythough is right in an interview about emperyan age ccp members clearly stated that there moving away from the sandbox concept except for 00 this to attract new players only uupsite for the sandbox lovers is they also clearly stated they look at more ways to make people go into 00 space so the become part of the sandbox part again
1 if they have a factional ship they already spread some of the wealth2 you get irretated by things said in local  i only look there for people that are in that system cant be bother by wath there saying sins there normally there always a few noobs around3 if there isnt anything else to do in high sec then shooting newbies why are you even there  go somewhere where there is something to do
if eve was still a reall sandbox why is there a wardec mechanisme  and why can you only declare war 3 thimes  answer eve isnt a reall sandbox game anymore
1 i didnt get any of the wealth i think i deserve some2 i have found a good way to shut em up is to shoot up their ships its also fun to pod em3 there are 5 year old characters in high sec i like high sec its fun to show people in high sec aint safe
ccp understands that the current system needs workthe fact that there arent current plans to change the wardec system it is something they as qouted want to change they just havent thoughed of a system that really appeals to them atm
the problem with wardecs is that it discourages people from forming corps and encourages them to sit in the npc corp which sucksid say cut the income of people in npc corps and introduce some mechanism to discourage read not eliminate random wardecsthat is not to make it impossible but give the 3yearold 50man pvp corp a reason to wardec someone other than a 5man newbie mining corp
introduce cosmetic surgery in ambulation tadaaa
im almost tempted to support this simply cause achura males are so fugly it hurts to look at thembut nah live with your choices just like everyone else have to
no i might be drunk when choosing and pick god forbid a gallente if i did that you all would be denied the wonder and beauty of my mohawk and that my friends can not happen
in response to jade constantine post about bringing more events to eve i decided to post thisi would love to see more npc interaction i played a game called rappelz for a short time and there would be sieges of the dungeons 30 min before those sieges a server message would go out and say  x min till so and so siege then every one would gather at the entrance and the event would take placemy idea of incorporating that style into eve would be this make light of the regional and constellation chat channels the message would say something like large hostile fleet seen in xyz constellation posted in the regional chat channel then once you are in this constellation you would get a sos from a npc station every so many minwhat is the event well simple as this say you are in amarr what are the normal rats sanshajust have a fleet of rats start attacking the npc station the npc station will never be taken over because in the end the police show up have it be a timer that once and event has started if none of the rats in the fleet have been blown up then the navy show up with overwhelming forces and nuke the rats thus ending a event that no one is taking part init would be able to make this easier and harder depending on the sec status of the system so in 04 system have the faction navy help kill stuff and or just make the rats be in smaller easier to kill ships the lower the security the less help and the larger the rats get this would also get more people into low sec as there would be more to itto me it seems silly that you have these rats or factions that are only seen in belts most of the time and in their own facilities that you see with missions why dont they ever try to make a run on the stations of systems they hunt inyou can make it so that is escalates as well and maybe once a month you can get it where the rats are attacking the station and fail and declare they have back up coming and waves of them come in and at the end you might get a faction item from the leader or maybe a low scale officer module but i guess the officer modules would have to be for if they ever wanted to implement this with outposts in 00  and seeing as there is no way destroy an outpost i dont see why not i would like to hear your comments
warning a large amount of text is about to follow the devs asked for a detailed alternative to the current sov mechanics here one iscurrent issueslack of a decisive battle sov warfare as implemented can be described as attack pos reinforce attack pos rinse repeat instead of one battle a number of small battles happen around each pos in system if there is a single decisive battle it consists of either attempting to enter the system or attack on the cyno jammerposes are weak the current large pos is balanced against a battleship fleet with two or three capships acting as flagships some of the larger recent cap battles have seen more then 100 capships on each side indeed many battles are fought around the gate the defenders trying to keep the attackers out instead of at a fortified hardpoint the posscenery current pos mechanics encourage the claiming of space that will not be used ie scenery a single large pos can be used to claim a system and begin accumulating sov eventually a scenery system can be linked into a jumpbridge network andor cynojammed to degrade enemy logisticsmodificationmilitary pos each level of pos small medium large currently trumps the sov claims of all poses of a lower level a military pos will trump the sov claims of all large poses in the system a system can have one and only one military pos at a time a military pos can only be deployed in player claimable 00production sov poses will be available in either bpc or manufactured form from each empire faction navies lp store costs will be equal to purchase of a faction battleship or faction battleship bpc each system that currently has an outpost or conquerable station and uncontested sov will have one large sov claiming pos transformed into a military posstats a military pos will have 10x the hps of the current equivalent best pirate faction pos modules will be bonused to have 3x the ehp per resists all guns and missiles equipped to a military pos will do an additional 10x damage base  current pos bonus  10 and have an extra 50 range unlike a civilian pos cpu using modules will not go offline when a military pos goes into reinforceda military pos will have the same grid as the current best pirate faction pos of its type it will have UFFFD the current best named cpu to prevent ewar star poses fuel and stront bays will be 7x the size of current large pirate faction bays and consume 7x the fuel of their respective large counterparts neither a cynojammer nor a pos jumpbridge may be onlined at a military posreinforcement unlike a civilian pos a military pos will come out of reinforced only at certain times selectable by the defenders these will correspond roughly to 8 pm moscow central european gmt us est us pst and oceanic a thirty minute variation will be introduced based on the dominate rat type of the region to help distribute server loads this allows an attacker to hit multiple points with some assurance that more then one will come out of reinforced at the same timeintermediate objectivesa new concept will be introduced of occupancy points occupancy is determined by adding computing the daily system use index this consists of all rat bounties collected in system  bonus for each plex completed  npc price value of all mineralsgas but not moon materials mined daily use index  value of all good items sold at outpost market in system is compared to the average daily use index for all systems of a similar truesec rating note this average daily used does not include market sales systems in the top UFFFD gain 5 occupancy points systems in the middle UFFFD gain 1 occupancy point every 3 large poses flown in a system by the sov claiming alliance generated 1 additional occupancy point los of sov zeros out all occupancy points

why are you trying to combine battles and focus them into one even bigger blob the servers cant handle that
my suggestion is this sov is determined by number of shiptonnagehours in systemthat is rather than depending on having structures erected sov is simply maintained by having people flying ships in a system the more ships and the bigger the ships that people are flying in a system the more that alliance owns the systemsov bonuses will then be a metagame statistic that reflects the level of presence that an alliance can muster to control a system i guess a story to explain it is that sov would simulate the patrols that are being done by hirelings of a system whateverpos warfare encourages blobs many smaller roaming fleets would encourage folks to spread out more sov gains could be tuned to favour smaller gangs that move about eg on a logarithmic factor for number of number of ships linear factor for tonnage exponential factor for number of warps within system exponential factor for number of jumps into the systembut what benefit does sovereignty actually provide simply the right to erect pos in system some kind of bonus to combat in system perhaps high enough sov will invoke npc reinforcements any time a fight breaks out
because id rather have a battle once when the server can be reinforced then 1015 battles spread out over a weeks time when the servers are the luck of the draw besides youre going to see the same numbers for one big battle and first big push its just the weeks of laggy pain that come after that were taking care of
all real life references and subsequent posts have been removedthe candidate threads are designed to set questions to candidates about ingame issues any comments regarding real life issues will be removed and the poster warned
so hey who wants to discuss spaceships
sounds good i support your candidature as well
i endorse scaggas candidacy
lord scagga is the most worthy csm candidate to advance eve if you want a dependable deep thinking person who is knowledgeable about improving the fun gut wrenching soultearing fanatically obsessive part of eve then look no further my vote goes to him and i know this is also true for those who know him in person and in character
the main issue is it allows you to do things like deal with farmersmacro minerscourier mission runners seeing the same set of 20 characters running courier missions or mining for over 20 hours a day and not having a mechanism to deal with it is no fun you can petition them but as many of us know ccp does not always act you can possibly limit the war dec to a few weeks or other methods to limit abuse
its unreasonable to expect that every csm will be experts and advocates for every part of eve society and its quite unnecessary seeing as how there will undoubtedly be empire and low sec types on the board as well vuk lau has my votes he sounds to me like a man who would work hard to improve the 00 game and make it more accessible for all players
great person for the work to tackle eve issues that matter to all of us on daily basishe has displayed great character and understanding in dealing on alliance and player levels to get the required results for all parties involvedmy full support
i dont disagree with the fact that some less legit aspects of the game use npc corps but that does not mean that there isnt a vast part of legitimate npc corp players perhaps you should look at the npc corp chat channels aliastras channel is very much alive with people offering advice and talking about their accomplishments so are the other npc corps ive seeneven if the wardec would last a week what do you expect legitimate solo players to do about a 100 man grief corp camping their undock ramp you might as well ban them from the game as theres no way they can playi find it unacceptable that anyone would cause so much collateral which such a shortsighted mechanic it displays sheer ignorance of certain aspects of eve what id rather see was an issue which called for a stricter and quicker dealing with macroers as the masses of innocent people should not suffer because of a few mosquitos which someone tries to kill with a cannon
i do believe we have got waay to much csm members who are more worried about polishing empire aspects of eve then addressing major issues which trouble 00 alliances and warfare herei consider myself as 00 veteran and i am sure vast majority of pilots which are living in this part of eve would find vukUFFFDs ideas more then interesting and worthwhile of their voiceeve is more then one big empire mission doing game
youve already got my vote well not really but you know what i mean all the same  good luck though with your record i doubt youve any great need of it
first off anyone who pays the second ransom is a fool and deserves what they get for that matter anyone who pays the first ransom without at least doing an eve search check of cp for their corp name to see if theyre dishonorable ransomers probably deserves what they get too ive fought aggressive wardecs but ive never broken a ransom doing it for that matter unless my experience with said wardecs is very different from anyone elses the idea that theyre usually resolved by a griefer getting a ransom is totally wrong most of the wardecs my corp was involved with ended in the target paying a merc corp 5x as much as we were asking and the mercs and us fighting to basically a standstill  we held our own but we didnt usually manage to put them up against the wall hard enough to get money out at the end of it people have an unnatural hatred for paying off pirates anyways unrelated nostalgiaranting aside i will agree that wardecs are a badly implemented system and they need a lot of work the problem with any such system is that wars are all different  some are for ransom some are wars of mutual consent some are harassment and some are other things entirely in order for a wardec system to not be counterproductive it has to accommodate all of this there should probably be the option of turning a wardec into something much like a freeform contract  putting explicit terms down on paper though probably without the game enforcing them you can still do a blank one if you like but itd at least streamline the process and maybe make it generally more functional if they had some good preset options in there if you dont mind a public record of wars you could even incorporate a feedback system so theres a record of ransom violators aside from a forum search i think thats going too far but its an option if you prefer to go the route of having the game enforce these contracts one thing you can do is include a no redeccing for x days provision in the settlement i think that one would address a lot of the problems you mention and itd see a lot of use one thing in particular i dont want to see is the game setting victorydefeat conditions on player wars just because youre down 31 in kills after a week doesnt mean you think youve lost and im not willing to have the game force a loss on you when you want to fight to the end some wardeccers will find that tactic annoying  after all thats the whole point of it  but it is legitimate sorry if this seems a bit disjointed but thats basically my thoughts on the topic of wardecs for now at least
you just got my voteand i think i can vouch for my corpthanks for your response
thanks
im planning to vote elsewhere this time  last time i think i got drunk first and then flipped a coin for you or serenity steele  and now forget who won the toss  but id like to see you get your chance to act in a more official capacity for the csmi bid you good luck especially to a fellow aussie
edit longing in killed what i saidwhen are ingame events a bad thingtheirs nothing wrong with making the game more lively
i look forward to what you have to say on this i make no secret of the fact that i got into eve precisely because theres a lot of flying ships
and as promised i have a new blog post check it out  this one is filled with various things id work on as a csm and that i hope to work on even if not a csm though i believe i will be more effect working on them as a csmid post it here too but has more characters than are allowed in a single post  and as i mention in the post thats one thing id like to change not my verbosity thats a topic for a different discussion the character limit for postsactually ill probably post parts of it here tomorrow in order to allow for easier discussion even if i have to engage in the time honored tradition of saying continued at the bottom of my post
i just remembered you took part in the malkalen reliefthats more points for you
ha thanks  good deeds pay off it seemsthat was a fun time and a good example of a player run event  it was good as it was but i wonder if it could have been improved with some event running tools    i seem to recall one or two news articles mentioning it and that one of the main organizers got interviewed i think but it would have been cool to see our actions there be noticed a little more by ccp and have a slight effect upon the storyline
i dont see myself having to sacrifice relationships in the way you think viper i dont see myself saying we cant be friends anymore based on actions i take as a csm mind you i may be forced to make a decsision for the greater good and should that time come if i think it truly is for the greater good of the players thats what i will vote with i really dont think doing so will sacrifice any relationships although i might take flak for ithowever if i campaign on an issue im bound to try and make progress on it things like the nanonerf were in favor by much of the community but that does not mean it was the right decision
nice one mate good move on running for this i cannot think of another person best suited for the roleyou have a great understanding of the problems faced by both empire lowsec and 00 dwellers so youve got my vote
i fully support sophie daigneauthere are quite a few issues in scienceindustrymarket that need to be address and i believe sophie daigneau will hit these issueswhile sophie may be wealthly now he over came the challenges and logistic nightmares that held majority of us backwhile sophie kinda mention it but mining system needs to be address and if anyone knows whats wrong with economical issues in eve it would be sophie 12 votesplus i also fly the ships of the internet as a girl
sophie has done more to build goonswarms internal 00 economy than any other player im aware of he has a knack for recognizing business opportunities and a way of working to get others involved in his money making schemes as well as supporting our growing ecosystem of independent industrialists as such i suspect that hes a great candidate for industrialists everywhere but especially those that are interested in developing outofempire economies
having worked with sophie on a number of items though oftentimes via intermediaries i can say that it has a special flair for all things industrial it has done some simply amazing things when it comes to administration organization and management of industrial pursuitsany of you looking for an industrial advocate should take a serious look at sophie
listiin what ways would you like to see 00 income adjusted to affect balance or drive more involvementi think that there needs to be greater variety in income perhaps something unique to 00 but also some parity in how its obtained as it stands today conquerable 00 has mining and ratting moon mining is typically used to fund the conquering of space and the individual player has fewer opportunities ratting is concentrated on a few good systems and mining is often neglected due to the poor rate of return and the amount of effort requiredi personally feel that the space currently requiring the most effort to hold should be the most profitable as it stands today the risk vs reward equation is completely skewed theres little to no reason for an empire dweller to come to 00 as theyre making plenty where they are i think that the right approach is a carrot and stick methodology increase the value and youll increase interest conquerable 00 as it stands today is simply not worth the risk for virtually any starting alliances thus the low adoption ratehow do you see the ability to operate in 00 evolving to improve and keep up with the gamemy gut impression is that 00 logistics were made difficult as an artificial barrier to allowing small groups of people to conquer large swaths of space this has not proven to be the case the biggest impediment to people in conquerable 00 today is boredom as both the enemies and the mechanics have stagnated completely its the same dudes fighting the same dudes over the same space rinse repeat oh yay were going to shoot a pos for 5 hours tonight lets goessentially the games boring right now logistics need to be streamlined and moved away from something resembling self beatings alliances need to be given more options in managing and improving their space station upgrades were a good start but way too expensive with little to no impact on profitability perhaps some upgrades involving mission agents in space you hold sov over would be a workaround and help balance the profitability between conq 00 and knowntobebroken npc 00 we need to transition away from poss without turning it into factional warfare its a difficult task and one i dont have a personal vision for yet but id like to help think through the concerns thats part of what the roundtable at fanfest is meant to achievewhat improvements would you like to see in 00 as an endgame things to reward players for having made iti think i touched on this already but allowing sovreigns greater control over their space is desirable greater control over profitability and traffic perhaps some greater control over layout it all has to do with creating a reason to take space other than it being selffulfillinghow would you raise the status of 00 in a productive way to enrich the game00 is without a doubt the concept that i believe attracts most people to the game its the gigantic 00 wars that get free press its the idea of carving out your own slice of space that is the sexiest selling point right now that needs to start to once again reflect reality as it stands today 00 is dead and is the most leastvisited or spoken about aspect of the game by developers and we wonder why its also the most boring neglect is a terrible thingchanges to any capitals or subcaps in context of healthier 00i think that a lot of people complain about capitals i do think there should be some investigation into the cause of their proliferation i mean of course its the biggest ship and everyone wants to fly the biggest ship but the simple fact is that the game cant handle large capital engagements and theyre typically boring affairs in crippling lag fighters from carriers and mss provide an unrealistic advantage as theyre not affected entire fleets which may take ages to assemble are killed with one button click by a dd this is bad

needs more tech 2furthermore another question considering your radical views on all aspects of pvp in eve and in light of your previous answers on the general topic what is your opinion on jet can mining and the combat surrounding that do you think there is a problem and if so how would you change it feasibly which means no bans please explain your answer thoroughly with justifications for the proposed actions as well as how you think it would affect both parties

so i missed two actual scheduled meetings in 6 months quite the flare for the dramatic youve got there accentuating the negative but your data mining shows exactly what i said in the first place so im not quite sure what your point is in addressing me directly i guess its just easy to throw stones from the sidelines as far as your statement regarding people altering their schedules well its simply not going to happen its a completely unrealistic statement and while you may be the paragon of internet spaceship responsibility i can assure you nobody else is going to go hungry or miss a christening or the birth of their child in order to avoid offending your internet sensibilities
ccp diagoras has posted the results of the second csm submission to ccp for this term and so we finally have responses on these topics i havent seen much discussion on this list which i find rather surprising so i figured id start some talk about whatever you want but heres a few questions to start debateeveryone what do you think of the responses  are there any youre excited or disappointed to see which do you think is a higher priority  bounty huntermerc improvements or sovereignty changesor other game changes of similar weight what do you have to say about the questions raised by the review of missions candidates are any of ccps responses going to cause you to change any elements of your platform are there any topics where youd press ccp for a more complete or more satisfactory response do you think these responses change what sort of topics the csm should advance in future
id like to see more communication with specific developers ccp should assign a dev to an issue so that afterwards the csm that owns the issue can get in touch with feedback or ask for a status update now i get the feeling that some issues like the gametime codes are just being ignored and we dont have the means to go after it likewise id like to see much more interaction for industry affairs we got an expansion coming up so why not use the csm to gather player intererst and organize discussions i think we should have something akin to live dev blogs with csm people but instead that they can ask questions directlyim not too happy with the answers given to us there was more discussion than you can see in the minutes but it was still too shallow to my tastes
i am still open for questions that anyone might have please feel free to post herekaiden
first a little bit about me i am 45 single and have played various online type games for close to 20 years feel free to insert jokes about being single and a gamer here i currently live in glendale arizona and work for a large corporation in internal technical support way back in the late eighties i got into computers and gaming online back then it was calling up bbss and turn based games i even ran a successful bbs here in arizona called quantum leap bbs for about 5 years soon after the internet started opening up to the public i started playing muds via telnet back then you traveled the internet via programs like pine elm telnet and gopher there were maybe a few hundred web pages out at that time i ended up playing a mud called ragnarok for a few years and played it up until 1999 when a new game came out called everquest i ended up playing eq for close to 7 years during that time i helped beta test several of the expansions for eq as well during that time i also beta tested planetside along with its first expansion about two years ago i beta tested and continued to play vanguard roughly 6 months ago i was setting up a lynx box and ran across the game we all love called eve i currently run two accounts on eve the main account is quantum light and is run as a pve manufacturing and exploration my second account is a miner called quantum light1 duh i also have a few other characters for hauling and hunting macro miners for now i am not into pvp but who knows down the road that could change coming over from the world of everquest and other sony based games has given me a bit of a different point of view coming into the world of eve first i still tend to cringe every time i do a mission for soe the biggest thing to surprise me is how cold blooded and ruthless it gets on the forums eve players have made an art form out of trolling my guess is it has a lot to due with eve being a pvp based game most of the time it can be quite entertaining but it does tend to bury some very good ideas under a lot of bull this is probably one of the main reasons i decided to run for csm i am the type of person that prefers to sit back and listen to the entire ranting strip off the emotion and make a decision based on the facts and logic a point in case it i remember a poster something to the effect that heshe wanted no demanded that this change be put in and that ccp put it in today or he would quit the game needless to say a good portion of the people wished him good bye and a good time playing wow i can also guarantee you no matter how good his idea was ccp was not even look at it due to the way he presented it first any idea presented to ccp for consideration must be well though out and worded with minimal emotion ccp is a company and eve is the product that they produce and as a company they need to look at any change put to them and see how it affects the company and the game i am not trying to side up with or suck up to ccp but trying to bring to a point the following any idea that is presented to ccp you need to strip any emotions from it and present to them just the well thought out facts demanding bullying whining etc will only tent to get them to close their ears and eyes to what may be a really good idea
as for wanting an idea implemented right now or today sorry but i will not back it there are most likely more than a million of lines of code in eve and you want to changeadd code into it within a few days that could make the bootini fiasco pale in comparison i have seen in my own job what happens when someone put in just a little code change without testing or checking with other areas the 3 lines of code brought down the entire mainframe for 3 hours right at deadlinewhat i hope to bring is a calm logical voice to the csm that can take the ideas put fourth in a very raw form on the forums and other areas and then turn them into a well thought out form that ccp would put serious thought to this includes ideas for all parts of the game including pvp alliance mining exploration pve trading and manufacturing as they are all needed for eve to succeed
bump
maybe theyll be fixed by this time next year unsmith
boost the nag
wait you mean ccp are taking another csmsponsored issue and lumping it into another maybe well look at it later pile shocking
sup
i agree 100 and would even give this high prioritythe decision to abandon events that involve the players was the single worst one ccp ever took
support
supportedmy best experience was escorting the speaker of truth several events those events are still high on the list of reasons i love eve
this would be a welcome returnlets hope the icelandic economy can stretch a bit further to accommodate the new team it would be money well spent

i managed to get involved in only a minor way with the brothers of freedom plotline while i was part of strix it was great fun to think that you were actually able to have an effect on the outcome of the story albeit that the plotline kind of petered out somewhat at the end anyway i definitely agree that these kind of events definitely help to make the eve universe the great place to be that it is however i would not suggest providing any sort of material gain from these events  simply taking part should be incentive enough and material gain may in fact promote the wrong kind of behaviour at such events
getting live events back would be huge for the roleplaying community and for the game in general make it happen

against the nano nerf in the current form as it severely limits the possibilities of 1 vs multi pvp in a blasterbs with improved tracking on blasterobats andor not as severaly nerfed webbers i might be in favor of some of these changescheers xeno
againt too in its current form
against
as specialist in minmatar ships this will devastate my charcterwasting years of skill training im most definatley against the nano nerf go fix the lag instead minmatar have already been nerfed to hell leave us alone
i have to agree  it would be interesting to have the downtime cycling but as others have also pointed out it not likely to be received to well by ccp  specifically the person that would have to restart the servers at 300am their timethanks for the view points and opinions
a cycling downtime would be a horrible idea youd never really know when it would be off next time unless you played every day it would also seriously frell up ccps server tech support schedule those responsible for immediate startup server issues would really hate you for cycling shifts
with all due respect did you forget that there are time zones around the planetccp wont do it its likely they picked that time because its the least amount of traffic loadand its conveniently timed during nonbusiness hours for an atypical office
im fine with the dt and 22 gmt is way to late because everybody is at home and need their eve fix
i believe its evident to all the thinking eve players that ccp have been lacking in making blockade runners completly invulnerableyes with the new addition of the cov ops cloak and the ability to warp cloaked it will be impossible to kill them in low sec and difficult to kill them in 00but there are still occasions where they might be caught perhaps a one in a million collision with a space pea in lowsec uncloaking it before it insta warpsits called a blockade runner stupids its supposed to run the blockades not die to them or else it would be called a blockade dieship or something as such i would like to propose blockade runners be boosted with a mini dock wormhole device the idea is thisplayer is docked in jitaplayer buys cargoplayer select pull down menu and chooses system and station he wishes to go toplayer instantly is transported to said stationplayer sells cargo for profitjust call it jovian something or other and people will accept the techskunk
someone give me marshmellows i have the graham crackers and chocolatecampfire is about to start
first page on another stupid topicccp did a good thing on the br if you ever saw pirates whining then here it is
does it say low sec pirate under my namei think notim a low sec liberator and i would remind you of this distinction every time you postalso you forgot to tick supportskunk
lets say this is done whats makes your cargo worth more now anyone can now negate the risk of traviling to buy stuff so the value of your cargo has been lowered and now your only selling to the lazy that dont want to travel to jita
since it pretty much is just bots and pirates in low sec if you pirate the pirates you kind of are a pirateya blockade runners are pretty much immune to being caught as it is they then gave pirates hictors which still rarely caught blockade runnersoh and le skunkwhen you have 10 sec status you are a pirate by definition
im only 9999 true sec statusskunk
actually hes an outlaw by definition not a pirate
thats the stupidest idea ive ever heardi mean while i think they need to be buffed but to give them such an ability is insaneyou want to help blockade runners how about giving them more low slots and 2 war stab bonus for every ship under transport ship classthat or boosting cargo spacenow your talkingyoull need an interdictor to stop those suckers and that means anyone serious about nailing those suckers would have to be serious with cash and effortthat makes sense not some damned harebrained idea of a wormholetalk bout messing up balanceps i happen to fly blockade runners they need a bit more love not godmodeme thumbs down
its called a blockade runner stupids not a blocakade dieerwhat sense does it make to call this ship a blockade runner if its goging to die on the blockadeskunk
actualy maybe ccp shoulda equipped a pirate whine fail bomb launcher
its called a blockade runner because its designed to bust bloackades not become freaking impossible to stopcatchshootinvunerablemight as well call the damn thing a concord frigatecruiser or something at that rate
dont be silly its designed by ccp to be invulnerable in low sec  hene the addition of the cov ops cloak usageskunk
if i wantted to be silly id call you pepe la pewccp didnt design the blockade runner to be invulnerable they designed it to have a higher chance of surviving a gatecamp and breaking through blockadesand in case you didnt know this they call them transport shipsso obviously calling them a blockade runner is a bit of a misnomernow if they are granting covert ops cloak well id say that about makes it drastically harder to nail them dont youwhy make it any more insanei mean sheesh i cant believe im taking the side of a pirate here
nice troll post btw even if i dont agree with you
why is it called a blockade runner if your idea will never have it going near blockades
lol i want some marshmellows too
ok ok you have me there but transport ships and blockade runners are 2 literal thingsbut yes i concede your right
i agree there are already four major conglomerates aka coalitions nations etc and this would give them an easy interface to control everything there are also a few lone wolf alliances but those are rarefor instance we have the greater bob community the northern coalition iron mostly harmless razor etc the southern coalition goon red iac etc and the providence coalition cva et al this would allow them to set naps and control rights for outposts automatically giving a greater sense of community in the game
supporting the idea i think it could use a lot of thinking over and refinement though id like to see this as possibly something that individual corps can be members of not just alliances and that is not just for big groups in 00 but for small coalitions in lowsec as well
ill support this in thats its an idea worth investigating though id want to hear more about specifics before supporting it being implemented of course
additional thought perhaps if this were implemented in some form fw could work like coalitions  so some alliances could join but big 00 powers that wanted to form their own coalitions could not just a thought
ive never wantted to join an allaince due to the obvious poltical overtones that would be forced on the member corps so to speakbut a this this allows formal pacts between alliances so they can maintain a bit of independence but support each other nonethelessme forgot to hit support
im sure this has been gone over before but i have not seen or could find a motion made or submitted to the csm members what i have noticed is that the drone regions keeping the market over saturated with morphite this dose 2 things that i can see are undeniablediscourages miners from mining morphite because there are minerals to mine that will pay more on the houralso it drives the cost of t2 products down which in turn drives the rest of all the t2 components and advanced minerals down due to the end sale value of the product in which the producer is going the want to make a profit and pass the loss down to linei believe that if morphite based alloys were removed from drone npc ship loot tables then it would case a positive impact on the current t2 market
removing minerals from loot would in general be quite good imo
high sec lvl 4 missions generate morphite and large quantities of zydrine and megacyte because of drones essentially hurting the profit of 00
call me confused how does decreasing the cost to build a t2 item through lowerpriced materials required for construction create for the t2 builder a loss that he pass on to the consumer in the form of higher prices the opposite is true decreasing the supply of morphite as you suggest will drive the cost of morphite up and with it the cost of all items that require morphite to constructthat having been said you still might be right about morphite being too easy to get through ratting in the drone regions it might be for example that the ratio of morphite alloys to other allows is too high some datamining ought to be useful here and some things they could look at includea is the value worth of drone droppings reasonable compared to the loot and bounty of similar nondrone ratsb does the mineral distribution of the drone droppings favor morphite too muchc does the compactness of the drone droppings compared to conventional loot plus bounties make it possible to profit more from drones than other npc ratsif inbalances are found they coulda change the total amounts of drone droppings per killb change the ratio of morphite droppings to nonmorphite droppings while keeping the value constantc change the size of rat droppings
oh i disagree that droppings should be removed entirely though drone droppings are actually better in some ways than bounties since they do not represent an influx of isk into the game like bounties do they give valuable property to the ratter which can be sold but isk is not created it is transferred from other players
would that include drone metals where minerals are the only thing you get for killing them
definitely theyve been awesome so far
i dont want it steals to weekends of pure watching pleasure and pop corn eating oh wait i want that
poasting support
the alliance tourney rocks and has kept me renewing my subscription for the last couple of years seems like whenever im getting bored with the game the tourney rolls around and reminds me how awesome this game can be
how can this even be a question does ccp think all the viewers theyve had for the past tournaments dont want more this is like fifa asking if they should keep holding the world cup
yes yes yes
the alliance tournaments were a lot of fun
something very much needed
this and jump clones onto api so you can see when your next jump can happen
more things to help trade and industry are always welcome
what i dont understand is that we are on a forum and the advantages of a forum are there are many tools to audit and listen to the suscribed people like rating for the thread and polls threadlets say im selling a program and im about to make deep changes in the way its used shouldnt i ask my usersbase if the changes im trying to implement are not gonna put them in troubles   especially when those same users are paying 2 or 3 times the license to use it because of their multiple accounts now lets say we are in the future in 2014 everything is done serverclient side ccp programmers3d graphists are respectively using microsoft visual studio 16 and autodesk maya 2014 each morning they launch their client to use maya or visual suddendly autodesk say hey  we are gonna change maya architecture now you will need to do your modelling with metaballs  hope we dont put the crap in everything you have done for years  you are not happy arent you   since the software is working online ccp dont have the choice and is fued  i guess they would not be happy themselvesso it would be nice if ccp developpers play their game play it well  not doing crappy pew pew on sisi that doesnt count and isnt representative of tq  respect their customers that give them a lot of money every months to get fun listen their customers talk with them whenever you are doing deep changes that compromise a lot of stuffits the minimal to do but thats get really rare these daysnow im waiting for the blaster poll dont tell us its impossible to put this mechanism on track every forum on internet as it
supporting this thread for all galentean pilots out there
signedbig mistake ccp
i just went back to look at an older thread from events and it was gone did they only move the last week or two of threads thats just disgusting
as far as i can tell theyve only moved those threads where the op knew aboutbothered to petition ccp to do so there might be a few exceptions  impossible to tell5 years of big lottery threads down the tubeim pretty gutted about that tbhparticularly sad with regards to the anniversary round threadsand as said above  the mood of both channels are completly destroyed
i see what you meant by that yeah  i didnt realize theyd deleted i assumed theyd just merged the boards like any sane person would have done my lottery thread was moved without a request but it was for an active lottery they probably knew it was rather important as for your threads i know the big site is still there and so is eve search but the loss of those threads is just a waste its one of the classic institutions of this game it should get better treatment than that deleting forum data is something that should never be done unless theres a very good reason and this is exactly why
in all honesty flying a capital ship is something that should always require some teamwork and i think thats what ccp have been trying to do with how cynos are nowhaving cyno gens in low sec would make things much to easy
why stop there we should remove the sov needs for capital assembly arrays as well that way everyone would have an opportunity to build their own titan or mothership
i understand that some people feel that capital ships should need some forum of team work to work properly the main point im trying to get across is that some times you are in the wrong time zone and there is no way for some one to help you in the corp or alliance you are in take the prime time for eve the uk theirs plenty of people around during that time but for us time zone players some alliances just go dead and cant get any one to help so you stuck doing one of 2 thingssitting therebegging for help when there is none getting nothing done whats the pointortraining 2 cyno alts on a second accountand like i said before i do not believe this game should be alt inflamed as it is so in response to the sarcasm in dianeces post you have not addressed ether of my main ideas in a positive or negative way so please refrain from saying anything at all next time unless you have something real to add
i agree that having autopilot default to 0km is not a good idea but there is some room for improvement i think to make afk traveling a little easierfor example adding an option to the fittings on your ship to default on after a warp you could set your afterburners boosters and hardeners to turn on automatically then after each exit out of warp  have you ever been in a battle and realized halfway through that you forgot to turn something on
this or even better cause its not so overpowered autopilot to be able to use mwdablike its now its just ridiculous we are in a high tech future we should have some features
the main wtz ap thread in features and ideas be aware that many arguments have been posted there and shot down try not to repeat themand why is choosing between bordem or increased travel time a good idea  so how does roleplaying deal with afk  ah yes the human pilot is somehow much more accurate than the computer built specifically for navigation when you need accuracy on the order of tiny fractions of a secondeven when computers in real life generally are much more accurate than humans when all the rules are known especially when it comes to doing something within a tiny fraction of a second of when you want it to happenif you want to see how small a fraction go calculate how long your ship takes to travel 15km when your going at your max warp velocity because that is how well you need to time the start of the declaration so most gatecamps today are incapable of catching anyone who isnt using the current autopilot  but if you dont align quick enough the wtz autopilot will screw you over even when manual flight will get you out and even if you are at the controls it will decloak you before you decide what the best action isyes back to the speedbordem tradeoffif you guys come up with an argument that i havent seen in the main wtz ap thread please post it there since i wont be watching this thread
if we were to have an individual window for every character docked in station i would agree  this would tax the system too much but how about one window that everyone could look out something as simple as a default that is nothing customizable as the regular overview but something very basic thoughts
it wouldnt be that hard to write an animation with ships flying around ok so its not really looking out the window to real space but yes i would like to open up things it seems claustrophobickaiden
would be awesome in ambulation to see outside station on the ships docking and undocking
quote from zuluparks qa sessionfalcon  ecmyeah afaik nozh is looking at range bonuses on caldari ships and he wants to improve eccm
is this a falcon with a psychic pilot who having received advice from obiwan has fitted 6 faction magentometric jammers or is this a falcon with a normal pilot who has fitted 1 of each kindps who the hell uses faction jammers
remote eccm 13 more effective than local eccm and you can mount 12 of them on a drake that will otherwise be ignored
thats fine as long as the falcon and rook get speed tank drone bays and a nifty second ability like the other recons get to match their short range ewps none of the other races ew is as shortranged as 40km t2 tracking disruptors have a 72km optinal with skills with rigs you can take that past 100km
this
let them eat cake and have it toosaid person was beheaded shortly thereafter
lets test the hypocrisy geneill vote for this if everytime the server starts up earlier or goes down later for dt its likewise added or rather subtracted to your total gaming timeany takers
yes ill take that
i dont like paying for things that dont work who does and normaly when something doesnt work the supplier is responsible to ensure the customer yes we are youre customers ccp however undervalued is properly reembursed so i vote we should be reembursed for extended dts and server crashes since after all if ever 1 lasts more than 3 days well lose skill training too
and you are a liari havent abused any game mechanics and you should be man enough to admit that what happend was thisi claimed killrights given to me by concord after 8 guys shot mecorrectthe truth is that your just ed at me for killing 7 of them in high sec and there wasnt anything you could do about itand if you feel im a griefer for claiming killrights then please petition me to ccp and maybe it is time to look into why we have declared war on your corpcould it be all the lies and crap your corp members was spitting out in militia about mentally unstable and if pvp is all you ever wanted then undockand finallyi have only been in a militia gang 2 times in my life and that was my first days in mentl and both time the militia members ran when i fought the gallentes so get your fact straight so bottom line you shot me giving me killrightsi claim killrights and you guys whiiine and whiiiine calling me griefer
wow can i just say hi potif anyone is a liar its you oodin not to get off topic but man i was in few fw fleets with you where you started firing at fleet members and if fw was a real alliance your ass would have been kicked out just for thatthe problem here is fw doesnt have a human figure head so there are no judements and i feel this has been over looked fw needs to have some control for your type of crap chicken  actionsand now i wish in the game ingor worked in the forum too
i never said i didnt shoot militia members all i said was i claimed killrights given to me and if you have any clue whatsoever about the game you would know that to get killrights a crime must have be commited against me firstyou understand that i hopekarma sucks
thats exatly my point there oodin you picked the wrong time to collect on kill rigths in a human alliance this type of action would have lead to you being kicked and possible your entire corp being kicked tell me this if you had been in a human lead alliance and you were out on an op with the alliance would have taken your kill rights thenyour no better then a corp that war dec and waits for a fw fleet to come by you hide your intent behind the fw and in every fleet that i was in with you the fleet disbanded as the entire op was ruined by your actions how is that any pvp fun for the group
i made a entire fleet disband i must be better then i tought besides the killrights was given to me when i was in militia so they stepped over the line first
lolyou obviously dont remember the start of fw where 10 forum posts a day were started by fw noob proclaiming we are smashing the pirates hahaha we are uberpirates left the area in droves due to the fw lag blobs flying aroundnow the whines back to pirates are bullying noobsnot supporting this thread of any other that seeks preferential treatment to one corp over anotherskunk
in principle i dont believe that being in the same militia should immunise your corporation against suffering the consequences of its behaviour towards other militia members i could see where youre coming from on this one but i dont think this is the right way to solve the problem rather i would suggest you consider this shouldnt these corporations be so enamoured by fw activities that decing each other becomes unthinkable by their own volition rather than an imposition by game mechanicsskaxx i would bring to your attention that many of those same corporations would love the extra targets that this proposition would incur this would be a oneway ticket to more wardecs against fw corps imoif i have understood you correctly treating the wardec as if it is against an alliance means that random fw pilots will suffer the consequences of other peoples misdeeds who may decide to use the militia as their haventhe enemy of my friend is my enemy logic is best avoided imagine how this would interact with the proposal 1 where if there was a corp in a militia hiding in militia high secif the militias are not to be so selective about who they let join the perks would not be matchingi think this one followed on from 3skaxx fw has plenty of room for improvement but i think the approach needs more consideration ive mentioned alternate approaches in my campaign thread that id be happy to discuss
maybe you should reread the entire thread as clearly that is not the idea here the only preferential treatment being given is for corps that war dec corps in fw and then wait for the easy picking of the one in the many fleet and kill it
3 in any of the militia high sec if you are an opposing faction you deal with both that militia and the militia npcs if a corporation decs a militia corporation and they choose to bring the fight into that militias high sec the npcs should assist said militia against the agressors3 the op wants both effective barring of 50 of empire and npc harrasement for the non militia corp this would not happen with non miltia deccing a non militiabasically i would wardec you in empire and be unable to attack you in empire and do the suppsoed stated aims of a wardec  disrupt your logistics etc in high sec as i would be unable to get in there easily without npcs kicking my assskunkedit ive said it many many many times before the only people who facilitate the picking off of members or a militia wardecced corps in a wider militia fleet are the cowards who sit and watch their gang mates die without firing out of fear of a sec dropi wouldnt have any one in any of my gangs if they were not prepared to fire if gangmates come under attack regardless of sec drops and sentrys
i have taken the sec drop but most of these events are happening in hi sec now so the best one can do is hope that they enguage you
now i finally see the extent of your game mechanics understandingyou are clueless so please go back to tutorial ok
im not sure that changing the wardec system to prevent two corps in the same militia from being at war is a good solution i could see it leading to situations where for example corp a in militia legitimately wardecs corp b not in the militia  and corp b responds by joining the militia to invalidate the wardecactually i think that the muchanticipated at least by some change to allow alliances in fw may depending on implementation details provide a solution to this problem in addition to allowing existing rp alliances to re join the war it will also provide the ability for corps already in the militias to form alliances too so now likeminded corps who are trying to fight for their faction can merge into an alliance for mutual support from wardecs increased organization shared standings etc or if less organization is preferable you could use the alliance for mutual defense only and ignore the standings and other tools available
edit ive changed the title to reflect that this is now a discussion as the proposal below is being reconsideredthe problemmany people ive spoken with have repeatedly mentioned that targets logging out in or around combat times also dubbed logoffski can be a virtually gamebreaking problem for many who pvp example 1 a raven is npcing in 00 when the pilot sees you in local his aligned ship warps to a safespot cloaks andor logs his ship which is not aggressed will disappear in 30 seconds there is nothing you can doexample 2 they jumped in  now our gang had theirs cornered it was going to be a bloody fight till they decided to stay cloaked and log offreviewing the current systemif i am not mistaken this is the current systemlog off cloaked ship cannot be probedlog off without aggression ship disappears in 30 secondslog off with aggression ship disappears when aggression endsnot to forget emergency warps a solutiona proposed solution i now present to you flatliningflatlining is a term im using to describe shutting down all a ships systems except those involved in crew life support systems including warp drive this causes the signature radius of a ship to drop markedly but also makes it unable to do anythingremember the current mechanics i mentionedthis is what i propose to have changed in current mechanicslog off cloaked noncov ops cloak deactivateslog off without aggression ship disappears in 5 minuteslog off with aggression ship disappears when aggression endshold on thats not balanced  yetnow add the flatliner setting to this mixif you log off with all systems shut down the ship disappears at the same time as mentioned above but the  chance of probing the ship down drops very significantly the ship however cannot warp out if caught due to having inactivated its warp drive to avoid detectionthere is a drawback however when you log back in it takes about 5 minutes to get the systems back to operational status  during which you could be probed again the warp drive is also deactivated  so if you are found you cant warp out or defend yourselfso log off with systems shut down you can be caught but it is more difficult if you are caught  you cant run if you log back in it will take time to switch the systems back on and go back to what you were doing eg pvpnpcingetc would it be used with the change proposed to cloaking mechanics  i think people will prefer this system to cloaking if logging out in hostile spacebenefits for the hunter with the extension of the time a ship can be found to 5 minutes if not aggressed hunters have a realistic chance of catching their prey for the prey with the flatliner settings the prey have a way to defend themselves if they have to log out but can remain logged in and cloaked if they can stay to play the game
supporting my own idea as suchone point please make suggestions if you see ways this proposal can be improved it may have aspects that i have not noticededit removing support while i reapproach the problem through further discussion to work round it
sounds interesting in theory but how will this effect someone who discos in the same situation ie wants to stay but connection drops instead will they be subject to this 5 min warm up time unless im mistaken if someone discod they would have to put up with this 5 min warm up where they could be probed and defencelessas far as someone who logoffski that seems fair but to someone who legitimatly discod that seems a bit harshcorrect me if im missing something
so what youre saying is that ccp doesnt pander enough to your desires and should give you free targets to track down and blow up
that is quite a legitimate concern it is unfortunate i think that the result of logging out vs disconnecting does not produce a different result ingame the situation where i think your observation is most relevant is for disconnecting without aggro  an extra 45 minutes to be scanned down for those who log out in pvp this would make no different however to address this concern one could suggest a small improvement to this ie allowing a user to set their ship to automatically shut down all systems if i log outdc in space  which would allow them to compensate for an unreliable connection otherwise i would be most inclined to hear what other workarounds people can think of indeed if a practical workaround doesnt seem possible itll be back to the drawingboard with this oneactually not miss rinn  you wouldnt be aware im sure that my current ingame activities are mainly engaged in market trading so this is hardly my own desires im catering to im trying to address problems that are frequently raised about pvp if you would like to suggest improvements please come forward
i guess it would be possible for the client to send a command to the server saying that someone has hit ctrlq or escquit game but it would be too easy to work around when you can just kill the process through task manager or even pull the network cableunfortunately this just gives the people loggers the ability to undo what you are trying to achieve with a simple toggle still pondering this one i can see why ccp had difficulty dealing with this issue
yes pulling the network cable or other conduits for simulating logging off in combat could confound things  however making pulling a log off more difficult may help with the issue perhapspersonally i didnt see it that way  because if the logger logs off and automatically goes into flatliner mode they can still be scanned down
for the determined logger i think they will just go around it thoughpersonally i didnt see it that way  because if the logger logs off and automatically goes into flatliner mode they can still be scanned downah i think i misinterpreted you there unfortunatly for the person who dcd they go into flatliner mode when they log back on and will have the 5 min warm up to contend with where the logger will just wait out the agressor and hope that they dont get scanned outif im understanding this part correctly
how to make 00 massive fleet wars really badtake your idea and mulitply it by 1000 pilotsnow shove in about 2000 to 3000 ships in one nodewow thats staggering to think aboutwhile i see the problem with the logging off your idea has a great many drawbacks and problems that would really be an issueit is virtually impossible to tell the difference between logging off and a disconnect when the server is heavily loadedspecially if theres a desynchif you cant detect such things effectively factoring in latency your going no where real quickthe only thing i could suggest is when you log off your modules go to idle status and it does what it always does warps outbut to take it any further than that would risk some nasty repercussions for those who do drop off line accidently
re determined loggers  yup no doubt the intention is to merely make it harder for one to always get away scot freere second part  yep thats closer to what i was thinking
mr draconis i agree with your points and they are actually quite convincing as i mentioned earlier in the thread  if it proved impractical itd definitely require a return to the drawing board unfortunately i did not consider the effects of 1000s of pilots doing this at the same timei would still like to look into the issue though while your suggestion of modules going idle and warping out is quite reasonable and quite close to if not precisely in line with current mechanics im sure there could be a way to make it better
thank you for the compliment quite rare hereyou have my respect o7as for your problem yes its an exploit to a certain degree but one that requires timing and quick reflexesits not something easily fixed and its never going to be as simple as lets do it this wayall of it is due to the nature of the insanity that is the internet tcpip structure is such that to know the difference between logging off and disconnect would depend entirely on the server thats watching the so called playernodeif they dont have the adequate tech to track theres not much to be doneit would require the client to send information to the server upon reconnect some sort of indication of what happenedwhich could lead to a number of security implications but it would allow the petitioning of logoffskis to be punished so to speakbut thats a very very messy solutioni guess im saying this is quite the pickle good luck
question does this proposal include getting rid of the emergency warp system im unclear on this point of your proposalsupport in principal getting rid of logoffski tactics need more info on the specific proposal before deciding to support or notedit also your changes mention that noncov ops ships which log off cloaked would be decloaked would this mean that covops ships that log off cloaked would stay cloaked i have noticed that when logging off cloaked in my covops i am not cloaked when i log back in   
while i must say i have relegated the idea to a review at present regarding your question no this proposal does not intend to remove the emergency warphowever if you have shut down your ship ie to help avoid detection  you will be unable to warp until the systems are all back onlineedit to include your second question mr avarr regarding the cloaking mechanics i was under the impression that if you logged off youd remain cloaked if i was mistaken about that i wouldnt propose changing anything in that department
as youre reconsidering the idea this is purely hypothetical now but  would the being unable to warp also apply to the autowarp back to where you were before the emergency warp if it does    this has some interesting uses which might be a good feature to add separately though i havent actually thought it out there may be good reasons not to allow blind warps of small distances    but its interesting to think aboutactually now that i think about it there probably are good reasons but its still interesting to think aboutedit to address the second part until i noticed that i was decloaked upon logging in my impression was that one would remain cloaked at least in a covops ship and i would recommend changing this to ensure that covops ships stay cloaked when logged off  though it could have been the log on that uncloaked me im not sure
emergency warp  logging off like usual and the ship auto warps out to a random location and then vanishes into a unknown dimension
it generally happens when logging off either normally while in space or due to a disconnect it can also happen when you lag a lot entering a new system im not certain if it happens if you currently have an aggression timer though a war target tried a logoffski on us a few days ago and his ship didnt go anywhere though his pod warped immediately as far as i understand it warps you 1000000km directly forward and then automatically warps you back when you log back instop lagging
seems to be far too many things wrong with this idea to support it but i was wonderingwould it be to difficult to just make the client communicate with the server when log off quit game is pushedso your in station push quitlog off nothing happens but the sameyour in space you quitlog off and the client tells the server you have done this and the server gives you an agro timer of so long lets say 5 minutes if you discon no communication happens between client and server so server gives normal rule of 30 second timer then disappearthis wouldnt solve the problem entirely but it will sure as hell reduce the number of people using it or would such a feature be to hard to install xailz
what happens when the client fails to communicate said information and the server is forced to make a choice without the facts to base itme evil computer nerd grin

yes when the present bunch of wasters have been ejected laden with silver in their ccp bumbags with the sound of ambulation trombones drowining out the megaprotest threads they convienienantly ignoredskunk
my idea is to simply readjust the damps so that their counter are sig amps that each damp gives 1 locked target if there are changes to rigs please remove them from the ship and put them in hangar baywaiting for all these topics at fanfestget sentries set them to aggesive focused get the rats shooting you kill 1 let drones pick new target let them shoot 12 times try to get them to shoot something else they will stay there for a second do nothing and revert back to original targetif i never leave highsec when do i get to see a titan when do i get to fly one never you say how about like any cap no rightly sofirstly you need to rebalance the faction bs some are far more pvp pointed bhaalgorn nobody will fly one of those for pvp rebalance for pve mission runningrattlesnake has a nasty tank but again not there perhaps make it like nightmarevindicator is pretty nice but since u cant use mwd in missionsyou dont need to do art for the rogue drone dominix its already is ingame as for balancing not very hard to do that
you cant say no to this sexymany rogue drones were harmed in the making of that pic
still working on a fuller version of the idea as i see ittwo critical things i am realizing more and more that it would need to be an economy helping tool are mechanics of zero sum and diminishing returnof those the second is vital as it is often not applied so well if at all in mmos diminishing return is often confused for your basic supply and demand mechanics and seems to be ignored when constructing a virtual economy and how resource manufacturing and cost to supply is done my view though is that it is a vital concept to have applied properly it should cost me more to produce the thousandth item or procure the thousandth resource then it did the first and it should be a cost factor completely of the suppliers concern in an idea like i am proposing as buyers wouldnt factor it into their perception of an items value they would just find a supplier who has produced an amount the market will support and has an agreeable price as a result
i think this idea has potential also one other possibile extension  extend the dynamic of the prices to the number of successful asset missions offered by agents in the system to players in general gives the person owning the asset an interest in seeing other players successfully completing these missions for example protecting the miners at a belt of some mineral asset from an npc ratattack would have an impact on the pricequantity of the assets that players have access too something very similar to successfully completing a mission now but with an added effect on the pricequantity of the assets this shouldnt be the only variable in the asset equation but i think it would make things more interesting in general 
why is your surname in capitals this is a question that has been haunting my sleep and i must know
i believe i did it originally because it was annoying
well good to see you running for a 2nd term as it stands right now you are one of the candidates i have on my imayjustvoteforthatonelist quite impressed with your dedication
im voting for you again even if you are a dirty gallente you were one of the most consistent csm members staying true to your beliefs
something seems odd here
you need me to spell it out for you the way i do every agenda is to ensure that each delegate gets one issue in the top nine in order of the time they request it if each of the nine delegates asked for an issue by friday they would appear in order in the top nine slots ie dariusjadelavistaankdierdatuskoinannabaneserenitythen the situation repeats itself for the next nine slots etc etc in practise the delegates often dont use their slots so i shuffle things forwards for example if nobody else puts an issue in this week the final version will look like thisdariusjadelavistatop nine slots issues in order of submissionlavistadariusnext nine slots in order of submissionlavistalavistanext nine slots in order of submission etc the reason for doing it this way is to ensure that no one delegate can bulk out the agenda with all their own issues if they wanted too and that however it works its not a game of issue snap and each delegate can be sure of getting an item in the top nine as long as they post to the agenda list and provide an issue doc by the friday before the meetingthis is the way its always been done only change ive made here is to put your issues into the list at the bottom before the reshuffle to make it easier for myself to tidy up on friday but dont think you are ever going to get a straight run of your issues at the higher end of the agenda unless other delegates opt not to put in an issue in the top nineso calm down and stop panicking please
ah come on im just wondering how come it was formated like that since i hadnt seen it like that beforestop taking offense because i didnt understand what was going on
ive known scagga for about 2 years and i endorse his campaignthis is a guy who is committed to eve i cant think of anyone with more pressing rl needs who still manages to put in the time and thought to this game like noma has said  implied scagga isnt scared to think bigbut this is a good thing he also can turn that laser inwards and i can recount convos of him and i a self confessed gaming min  maxer arguing extreme minute details of ship fittings to his credit hes usually rightmost of us can nail down a single or at most a few aspects of the eve universe combat trading construction exploration politics corp management mining etc scagga is proficient in all of them he loves to examine the status quo of his current endeavor and then think outside the box to improve upon what is currently the best build  tacticit should also be mentioned that he also finds the time to deal with other denizens of the eve universe most of us dont have time for thats right  the low  no sp nubs hes that kinda guyhonestly i dont know how he finds the time but he does and the eve universe is a better place for it
scagga is an excellent ideas man despite busy rl commitments he still keeps thinking about the game now im not saying all his ideas are good but the majority of them are  having scagga in the game certainly improves my eve experience and he will recieve my vote
thanks for the support chaps  it is most appreciated was late for lectures today so my mind wandered as i listened to music on the busthen i came up with a possible solution to people logging out in pvp flatliningedit some discussions down there have led me to believe this idea needs to go back to the drawingboard as it can be confounded in certain situationsach such is the fate of ideas of bus origin
added proposals on the economy and its markets to post 6
following some discussions on matters of fleet warfare ive added these proposals to the minor improvements allow the fc to know the shiptypes of his gangmembers automatically allowing him to assess the situation more accurately allow the fc to label that list with roles if necessarythanks nephilim xeno 
while i support alot of vuks policies i also agree with ankhesentapemkah regarding the ability to wardec people in npc corpsi think the amount of griefing would far out weight any gains of being able to target macros
hear hear
you bet macro runners are fully capable to fight back or pay others to do the fighting for them if push comes to shove so griefers would resort to picking on npc corp loners and noobies very bad idea
using npc corp to be totaly imune in empire needs to be reworked mission runners are really important for eve economy without any doubt and game for sure would not look the same without feeling being safe in high sec under npc corp banner but i still believe that there is something which can be implemented to prevent mission runners to mutate to mindless farming bots which current high sec missions are causing atm beside customer support and 00 issues which are both crying for atention i agree that pve needs huge boost i still miss aurora events and alongside issues i already mentioned my carebear soul would love to see more roleplaying both in empire and 00
and no sir smellyfart is not my alt
nice post even though you did dd me the other day edit considering my votes to ya
vuk is da best knows a lot about game mechanic and likes to play and enjoys the gameand also hes a nerd willing to devote a large rl portion to this stuff got my votes
i like what you have to say looks reasonable you have my vote
you seem to be focussing at bots again but ignore the fact that your suggestion has serious consequences for the legitimate part of the playersi see bots as a problem as well but i prefer to address them in different ways by changing the game mechanics to become more dynamic thus accomplishing both goals making it harder and perhaps even impossible to script a bot for them and provide more variation and enjoyment for those that use it as a legit income source
if i have a best vote i think youre getting it that said please give my 00 question thread a run to add some contrast at the highend of quality ideas i dont think theres any point in hiding that i think your feel for the game is very compelling
this corporate husk and politics sickens me while you fill me with love and resolveso ill be voting for you but ill be doing it sickeningly
these are some of herschel yamamotos pvp ship setups i think they speak for themselves
bane my friend this has to be a troll there is no way any normal eve player would fit a minmitar ship like this you see now if i was running for csm i would at least make sure my fits made sense
yeah those fits suck  theres a reason i abandoned that thread and it was because i lost the argument badly in my defence ive never flown any minmatar ship for anything and id never even thought about how to fit any minmatar battleship except a mission mael before that also i didnt realize just how severe the penalties on hail were  i was used to void as a t2 damage ammo which is tolerable if you assume the target is webbed those were workups in 10 minutes in eft made using the assumption of smallgang pvp fits with no rigswhich explains a few of the really odd things i did and also the intentional lack of tackle gear they turned out badly and i defended them longer than i should have but i dont think theyre quite as horrible as you imply
id ask oz a million questions but why botheroz for god
umm thanks i guess jossand hi odet
and what about my ingame security why would i actually want people to know my alts or mains as it wereif there is a ingame way for directors to account search features then i should have an ingame way to charge them a fee to do soout of game tactics should never be valid otherwise you open a can of worms such as including the ip address of peoples hosting services and their physical ipmac in their bios to launch dos attacks against your war targets big blob not anymorethrough api keys you are giving consent by generating your key and handing it over freely allowing anyone to know your alts sure give me 10000 and 100 bil isk
cross posted from my blog various things id work on as a csm blog post with the industry andor lowsec side of things to follow tonightin no particular order general forum improvementsccp has been changing the forums around a little lately trying to improve them im reserving comment on whether these changes really improve things or not but we need some other changes that i havent seen any indication ccp has planned as in the best way to do it would be throwing out the current forums and just replacing it with better forum software  though if that would be difficult due to linking forum accounts to eve and the rest of the site im unsure of the technical side of this just a few simple improvements like increasing the post length limit 4000 characters maybe i just like to talk but personally i find this a bit low adding a pm ability and a better search function and doing away with the profanity filter which doesnt screen a lot of profanities and screens a lot of things that arent profanities granted a number of them can be but not in the context theyre most commonly used in  and certainly not when theyre simply part of a larger word making it in game browser friendly would be really nifty too im sure there are other things too maybe you can suggest some while were talking about increasing the character limit on forum posts what about increasing the limit in evemails i routinely find myself having to break up a mailing into two or more parts which is extremely annoying and creates unneeded clutter in mailboxes everywhere in eve also in regards to eve mail the ability to dump it to a text file on ones computer would be nifty and make archiving things much easier we have chat logs  why not mail logs not just more space for eve mails but in bios too ability to kick players from a corp while they are in spaceoddly enough you cant kick players from a corp while they are in space which opens the door to all sorts of griefing as players can enter a corp under false pretenses open fire on corpmates without concord repercussions and remain in space as members of the corp to shoot any other corp members who happen to undock i doubt this happens every day but its something that id like to see fixed and that should be fairly easy to do if nothing else some more icons for corps to choose from in their logos would be nice especially some more obviously industrial mining research and trade related ones there are some true but    we could do with more i cant imagine this would be terribly difficult to do either on that same topic given the url
moving on to the topic of roleplay and immersion it has been rightly said that most of the content in eve is player created the entire 00 endgame for example as an aside  i personally believe the endgame is what each player makes of it and that 00 does not and should not hold exclusive claim to be eves endgame when it comes to immersion and eves storyline things are no different  most of the content and story is driven by the players id like to see ccp get involved and acknowledge the playerdriven storyline more capsuleers are the most powerful beings in eve the things we do should have an effect on eve and id like to see more acknowledgment of that from ccp see player driven storyline impact the official storyline more and see ccp controlled npcs interact with players much more opening things up again for players to submit stories to be made official chronicles would also be great at the same time theres nothing wrong with ccp created content lets have more of it maybe some more frequent chrons perhaps ones in a different style than abraxas  i dearly love his work but dont want to overwork him and variety is good  as well as more events especially events not related to factional warfare some dealing with industry and trade would be nice and some just pure freeform roleplay of course it could be that we have more than i think we do now in which case whats needed is a bit more publicity nothing wrong with combining player driven content and events though giving players tools to better create events would be pure win and awesome back to official content here i recall that at one point there was an effort to harmonize the prime fiction of eve to find the various things that dont agree with each other and ninjaedit that all out to the best of my knowledge though nothing ever came of this im sure there would be players willing to volunteer to find most of the discrepancies all ccp would have to do is decide what the official line for each of them is and make the editsand that wraps this segment up feel free to ask questions about any of these i would be more than delighted to reply more to come in my next blog post
meissas prettierbut then im prejudiced
im prettier than both of you and you can all stop derailing the thread now p

thanks for your support dent  i hope to be able to represent everyones views keep em coming guys im waiting for some taxing questions

 how did you feel the last csm went how do you think the process could be improved onthats all ive got so far gogogo csms
i think that the last csm session went better than i expected i certainly think there were some character and process flaws that didnt need to be there which continue to this day but i dont believe a lot of the drama and silliness from the first csm will carry over to the second as a new cast of people is elected ultimately though in spite of it i think there was a great deal of success that unfortunately both we and ccp are still trying to determine how best to communicatei think theres plenty of room for improvement in defining the council itself i still dont think its crystal clear where the council sits in the grand scheme of things which is pretty unfortunate after 6 months i also dont think thats something the council can definei definitely think the meetings can use a lot of improvement they start too early and end too late though theyre not as terribly managed as they were initially i actually think thats contributed greatly to the problems weve been having with attendancecommunication is also something that can be improved significantly part of the purpose of the council is for people of different backgrounds to get together and have a dialogue and far too often its simply not happening this is really self defeating as people are only willing to raise items to be ignored so many times before throwing in the towelid like to see more credit given to the csm when credits due this was mentioned before even in the meetings but i really dont see it happening if youre going to make a dev blog about a new change lets say to blockade runners and the csm had an impact on that why not mention that theres 1001 threads and a number of people who question the relevance of the csm and when there is a victory to point to i find it silly to not do so why should the csm be in a position to have to toot their own horns or volunteer their time to help shape these items and not be given any credit only to have to run to the messageboards to defend their relevance on their own on a weekly basis with absolutely no supporti think these items are growing pains though that actually sound a lot worse than they are both ccp and the csm are young and i think that with the proper care it can grow into something really interesting patience isnt a common virtue among gamers so its trying at times but i have a pretty positive outlook on the future
i know youve all been waiting and after some trials and tribulations the second movie has just been releasedso if you still need to decide where your vote goes or if you were wondering what my plans for the future are look no furtheryou can watch the new movie herequestions and feedback regarding the movie can be posted in this thread and if you have questions regarding my campaign issues or the take care organisation you can use my campaign thread
impressive i think the music distracted a little bit from it but otherwise i thought it was well done even if i wont be voting for you it was enjoyable to watch and a nice idea one that i wish i could do perhaps next time though   
shouldnt this really be added to your candidate thread instead
not really this is something different there is no limit to threads posted hereas there is no discussion of issuesvoting in this thread it is on a different topic
really so this isnt a plug for votes then and the movie is about something totally unconnected
posting in a thread that has an ingame video of me blowing things up oalso good video 
when was this
the little movie showing when i speak about factional warfare has siigari starring 
nice improved from the first one good luck with the campaign
did i ask you to skip such important things skipping meals is a total red herring given how many times ive seen brb lunch in the chatlogs and the occasional important event is fully acceptable to miss a meeting for jades 1200 is nice but i dont expect it what i do expect is that any member running will expect to manage inanna and lavistas 921  miss the odd meeting have to leave early or come in late sometimes but usually be there five delegates managed records on that level and one quit for some reason that presumably meant that he wouldnt be able to continue doing his job you bane and serenity have not done either i dont claim that youre wasting a chair or anything like that youre a good person to have on the committee and theres a couple issues where im pretty sure the rest of them would have done much better to have listened to you when i say your attendance has been subpar thats all im saying its not at the level where you should express your regrets and resign but its at the level where you should probably look at your schedule and figure out if you can do better next time or if you may want to sit out and wait to run for reelection until you can your record may be exactly what you said it was but i dont really think thats good enough i give the same advice to every other candidate as well  id be saying the same to bane and serenity if they were running and while i expect less of alternates ill say that tusko and arithron should make sure that they can do better than their past records would indicate if theyre electedi exclude oz because i expect us to schedule around him if he gets elected and hes made every meeting that hasnt been at 4 am local or hidden from him the same for new candidates  if you cant do the job withdraw from the race now and save us all the grief
as i said i matched the records you just held up as exemplary i missed 2 meetings with notice the last meeting i showed up for at the scheduled time time which had been cleared in my week for that express purpose and the meeting was moved to some internet format where no discussion was had and questions went unanswered sorry charlie but i think slamming me for actually showing up for scheduled meetings and being unable to attend a deviation is a bit of a farceschedule meetings hold to your schedule and i adjust my time as necessary when possible deviate and assume everyone elses life is going to adjust to a last minute internet change and dont be surprised by the resultsperhaps ill give your criticism a bit more validation when you actually have a record to be measured
the only attendance record i held up as exemplary was jades and you were nowhere near matching him you werent exemplary you werent in the adequate group with ank dierdra inanna and lavista you were down with bane and serenity in the cminus group still better than any alternate and still not wretched but weak and while my rl record is just fine for providing validation to my argument i know you cant access it so i understand you not trusting my unverified claims on that score electorate willing youll have good hard data on whether or not im a hypocrite come six months from now until then theres not really much more i can say
in order to have a two way dialogue you have to read what the other person says my record for scheduled meetings was every bit as good as anks inanna dierdra and lavistasi dont really care about your record personally i dont find it all that important you seem to think its a big deal which is something i find both hilarious and convenient youve obviously taken a great deal of time to examine editorialize and criticize my attendance record when you yourself have none when you have one to compare then well talk
you missed two scheduled meetings ank and deirdra missed none how exactly are those the same
apologies i had thought they had missed 2 as well i wasnt exactly buried in the numbers
i frankly agreehowever to be fair the term extended right trough the summer holiday period in my own case i went on holiday in seattle9 hour flight on a sunday and went back home on a sunday just because you get a spot doesnt mean you should attend every meeting and give up other important things eventually real life is more important than eve but i do agree you should do your damn best to make every meeting but in some cases its just not possible
actually darius this is incorrect you turned up one hour late behind the published starttime of the october 19th meeting and you apologized in channel for your lateness six other csms and alternates had waited in the channel for the previous hour and we were unable to start because we couldnt make quorum of seven by the time you arrived one of our alternates only had 30mins maximum before they absolutely had to head to bed and that is why we had to move to the suboptimal offline meeting format in the following weekif you are going to debate these things as part of your new election platform you need to be honest and state the facts as they happened i dont consider you were present for the october 19th live meeting csms and alternates in attendance for that were ank lavista omber jade dierdra tusko
actually you have forgotten to note that some of the alternates arent actually alternates players like me replaced inactive alternates well into the csm period its hardly fair to start comparing records of attendance when there is no way we could have made earlier meetingsit should also be noted that alternates should be called into meetings when a known absence from a csm member is known in advance i try and make as many meetings as i can but dont always have voting rights due to csm members making quorumtake carearithron
arithron makes a very fair point we did make a call to replace inactive alternates after the face to face iceland meeting in time for meeting 910 and i personally invited people who had scored lower than the existing inactive alternates to step up and become alternates to try and resolve the problem arithron is one of the guys who responded to the call and has made a good contribution to the csm since that decision
oh youre such a card your interpretation of present doesnt really matter the fact is that i was there late or not what you consider means nothing
thats what you said in this thread darius it was incorrect you either made a mistake or you were intentionally attempting to mislead the electorate here now is the moment for you to apologize probably you didnt show up at the scheduled time you know it i know it and you even apologized for lateness on the day this is quite a serious issue really  the eve player base needs to know that its csm delegates will take the obligations seriously and i have to say one of my major reservations about your candidacy is your ability to actually make time and commit to this process
v0v so i forgot i showed up a little late sue me the logs are there so purposely attempting to be misleading would be kind of silly now wouldnt it i appreciate that you think this is some manner of ohsoclever political manipulation but its really quite petty and hilarious no you didnt make it on time you showed up late crosses arms satisfactorilyyou know as well as i do that your questioning my candidacy has absolutely nothing to do with your concerns over anything other than your dislike of me i wonder why you could be bringing this issue up today given that youre so concerned and all youd think this would have been an issue the entire time
it wouldnt have been an issue if youd just said sorry i was late as you did on the day but in this thread you have claimed on the record that you showed up at the scheduled time that was incorrect and misleading since by your own admission you didnt i think the eve voters deserve to know whether their candidates can be trusted to tell the truth or not if you are prepared to tell a little fib to make your attendance record sound better what else might you be prepared to embroider or exaggerate about if something more serious was involvednow you can either apologize for misleading people or you can try and argue with me your choice
ill argue with you instead as ive already responded to your clever attempt at a political monkey wrench the art of selective response has not been lost i see fyi cherrypicking the parts of the post you like when you respond doesnt make the others go away
i used the word try advisedly ultimately its pretty clear you lied in this thread in an effort to make your attendance and punctuality look better than it was your response to being challenged on this is to attempt wriggling and evasion perhaps thats considered an electoral asset amongst your supporters who knows but by all means have the last word on the issue ive now set the record straight and continue as you wish
you were better off with the insinuation directly calling me a liar is a bit silly when ive pointedly admitted that you may have been correct in my showing up a bit late to the meeting that would be what i call being honest you see i have no need to misrepresent my attendance record i honestly dont see anything wrong with it attempting to paint it as wriggling and evasion when the evidence in the thread points to the contrary is just as silly i made an honest mistake and admitted as much i will note though that we are glossing over the fact that being one of two representatives in the usa there is a 5 hour time difference and i can assure you theres a world of difference between getting up a 10am every sunday or every other as the case eventually became for a meeting about spaceships and strolling over to your computer at 3pm i have to set my alarm clock in order to make it its not a complaint but if were going to be tossing rocks around we may as well have all the facts on the tableim not the one who came to the thread with a bone to pick and i think youll find that ignoring what ive said in this very thread wont work out any better than your previous attempts at misdirection giving orders or hilarious threats by all means though continue selectively setting the record straight oh and thanks for the advice chum ill file it away with the restedit while were setting the record straight it would also be worthwhile to note that none of this was mentioned previously ever funny how election season brings out peoples sense of concern and responsibility
jade and arithron why do you think this is a bad idea
i considered parallel development of skill time acceleration for players on the test server to be a low priority compared to development effort weve advised ccp to spend elsewhere
hence why i provided those neat little summaries at the end if you werent basing your numbers on those what were you basing them on when you look back at how i counted you youll note that gritt and azzazellthe two slackers were counted for the first six meetings at which point they were replaced by ben and you ive counted each of you for six meetings and i havent penalized you for not being an alternate prior to that or them for not being an alternate after that of the six meetings that have happened since then youve made two i dont know if you have an explanation but those are the numbers i doubt either of you care but in case anyone does ill explain the definitions used in my stats attending means voting in all votes that happened at the meeting at least so far as my ability to ctrlf can determinei checked attendance at beginning and end i wasnt willing to read 10 chatlogs to determine if anyone left for half an hour in the middle partially attending means voting in at least one vote at that meeting but not all for alternates who arent replacing an absent member i use presence in the channel as the test instead of votes speaking specifically of darius in the aborted meeting 11 i gave him a partially attending since he got there late and thats what he would have rated had the meeting actually run
the purpose of the test server is to test changes part of the reason you might head there is to see how changes affect your character etc since skills on tranq not going to be same as character on test server itll mean that issues affecting your character if changes made to tranq may be missed i also think that its hard to find bugs and issues with things that are new to you which will be the case once you train to use ships etc you are unfamiliar withalso i dont think that the test server is as important as the server we play eve from there are more important things for ccp to be consideringtake carearithron
alot of the questions arent all that good but i dont think we can fix thathowever the way the issues were posted maybe wasnt the best way people need to be able to discuss each issue in its own thread the way this was posted compared to the way wrangler did it is a bit poor
a point but i think it would have been fine if hed linked back to the original issue threads actually thats probably the best way to do it come to think of it  means people wont keep adding to them forever
have there been any updates on this issue i dont read through the forums a lot due to my rl job
if ccp is thinking of revamping the whole messy pos mechanic an elegant and common sense solution like this should be at the top of their list for consideration
bump for gallente ewar love
supportedthere is very little point using rsd these daysif you need ew in a small gang the call for the falcon goes out
could they possibly be anymore vague as what i have come to expect from ccp their favorite tactic the five ds of content balance dodge duck dip dive and dodge
is it possible that i could be in agreement with a gallenteplease dont tell anyone
yes
wow this sounds coolmuch better than agent missions they get stale quickly this is what i thought all those innocuous news stories were all about on the right side of the character selection page but i was sadly mistakentoo bad some of these events sound like theyd be super fun if we could participate
definately the events of old are missed greatly by the older community getting them back would be a major step forward not to mention the droves of new players that organized events would bring inlets face it with events back in place actual events people would post on forums blogs youtube etc people would talk to their friends and coworkers about how they were involved in the massive slaughtering of empires the protection of a renouned president from viscious marauders people would come out of the woodwork to try it out to see what all the commotion is to see what it like to be a part of the game and not just a player subscriptions would increase ccp would get more money to fund ongoing projects and the community would be happier in general i understand the risk but isnt the reward worth itevents are the lifeblood of any rpg game nobody bothers to read the news posts anymore its just wasted text on the login screen why because it no longer affects us the players we have our systems our boats our guns and our wits were thrown into the game with no sense of direction or cause tell me did the empress coronation ceremony affect any of those i didnt see a cluster of new systems open i didnt get a shiny new ship i got nothing it was boring and nobody gave a crap about it after it happened hell most people dont even know it happened again because it doesnt affect us at alli miss the days when trying to attack a leader was possible when it wasnt all figureheads and text i want to see sarum floating around space with the amarr navy surrounding her i want to see heth coming and going from press conferences im tired of having a story fed to me whether i like it or not im tired of being powerless to change my surroundings im tired of watching everything collapse because i am a player and thus have no voicewe are the players we will be heard
i totally agree with bringing back interactive eventsi really envy those of you who were around when players were able to actually participate in the events that had a real bearing on the eve storyline it would be tremendous if those of us not fortunate enough to have 4 or 5 year old characters especially roleplayers could have that opportunity again
support or ill bump all over you 
i disagree with this though it sucks to lose the ghost training it never made sense to me in the first place i couldnt understand why one could get a benefit from this game and yet not pay that is just bad businessu pay  u playif you are paying you can get the advantages of playing  ie trianingnow however when are you guys gonna implement a skill queue so that we can get 100 benefit from paying this my friends is the real insult why cant i train things at the pace i want in the order i want without having to center my life around my home computer even though im paying for this gameremove ghost training i understand the business sense of this decision continue to refuse to give us a skill queue even though we are paying for this game and many people support it i dont understand the business sense of this decision you guys are as random as the wind
why not just decrease the training speed by 50 i think this would be the best option because i both agree and disagree with it being in the game and being taken outits always nice to come back to eve and being able to use a shiny new toy ive been playing on and off for about 5 years now but i think its being abused by people who have a skill that takes over 30 days to train pay for a month and cancel the account effectively gaining free training time while dualing to another account this would take that skill over 60 days to train but it would still train basically stopping the effectiveness of thisthat being saidfor people that genuinly cancel their account because they legitimately wanna take a break or just have been bored can still have the option of setting a long skill to train and coming back later whenever they feel like coming back as usually especially for me most people that genuinly want a break take a break for 34 months anyways that stops the abuse of someone that has two accounts and sets one skill to train and cancels it earning them 7 free days while they play another toon and still rewards people and makes them want to return after those breakssorry if this doesnt make too much sense my brain is fried as ive been at work since 5 am
this topic goes up 
give me a fuel bay and the ability to use a covops cloak and i will be happy with my sin give me some more powergrid along with it and i will be ecstatichaulers that can be jump bridged are not the solution although apparently that is what we are getting i suppose i can sell it to someone with a trader alt who needs to move stuff to and from low sec safelylike we dont already have enough haulers in this game
its bad enough as it is dont make it worse
sorry but the dt is a nice reminder for me to go to bed so while a 2200 dt wont stop me playing it will mean i risk staying up all night
i strongly disagree i think unnamed t1 loot should be removed from all npc spawns but removing minerals from loot that would flood the market with t1 goods this idea is outlined on my webpagelevel 4 missions are perhaps the only source of morphite in empire excluding the market so having something that gives the highsecurity players a taste of lowsec without seriously hindering the mercoxit mining trade is a good thingthe drone alloys replace bounties and allow the player to use said items to create ships and weapons and such yes even morphite for t2 items balancing the amount of compounds that the drones give out seems like the best answer to this problem if indeed it is a problem
nooooooo its hard enough getting good returns on drone region rats when you have to wait days for minerals to sell without them nerfing profits even more nerf l4 missions  they are the ones which contribute most of the morphite in highsec
nerf drone minerals please i am a miner and drone farmers drive me out of business mmm let drones give something else of value
like the title says i would love for that to be possibleyou know build an outpost donate it to the guristas bam guristas sov system guristas npcs in belts alongside the regular local npcs etc and if you could get something back from that standings andor lps for allsome corp members now that would be peachy too but if not eh ok too
this seems more likely to be used for truly epic griefing than for the kind of roleplay youre presumably thinking of who would spend several billion isk to give away sovereignty of a system
yes
yes
i support this as long as we see people without pants
theres always controversy around how they run it but as every year they try to address the concerns of the previous year keep it upvote yes 
big red yes tournament was always a highlight in this great game
great idea for additional info
this thread i support
i love it the way it is right now on tranq not sisi
id hate for it to get all sniping cowards
basically heres the plan  the starter corporations keep members for 30days this protects new players from excessive war dec griefing as i believe is ccps intentions however on the 31st day much like the agents already do they are handed off to the next higher level of the organization and to a more stable corporation for example moving from the republic military school to say the republic security services with these new npcs corporations taking on hirings change the rules and incorporate faction warfare so allow people in an amarr npc corporation to declare war on a minmatar npc corporation if players dont wish to par take in a pvp enviornment they have two options one is to state deep in minmatar or home race territory while the fringes are fought out the second is to join a player corporation that focuses on nonpvp type activities this will help flush out the macrominers as no one wants them in their corporation because theyre not a productive member to the corporation it will also allow the hostile npc corporation to thin the herd of macroming optionally you could also setup a war dec option for player corporations against the npc corporation but should restrict it to single corporations and not allow alliances to wardec again this would have to be looked at further and could cause a slew of griefing complaints but would help to push people out of the safety of the npc corporations and into actual productive members of real corporations just an idea i was kicking around what do you all think
no all ideas that punish the large swathes of legitimate npc corp players to get to a few that abuse it cannot be allowed
exactly and this wouldnt even do much to flush out macroers because they can just form their own corp if they get wardeced they all just jump to another corp before the war goes liveor each macro miner just trains corp management 1 so it can sit in a 1 man corp thus still being safe from war decs
i got this recently from someone in my corp after they received the usual you sol on their petition not being that familiar with pos behavior i figured i would post it here and see if this made sense to anyone  and if so could you explain it to mewhat im saying is is that the pos should not have flagged and shot me before i enabled the agresssion setting but it did thus i earned a flag that should not have been there because of my act of aggression if this is normal then it is an apparent bug that must be addressed i still stand by my assertion that an aggro flag that shouldnt have been initiated was initiated thus resulting in the lossyour log should show myself dropping a can taking control of a laser battery firing on the can and then releasing control then i receive fire from said battery and duck into the forcefield therefore saving my ship then i set the aggression option after that i leave the forcefield and receive fire againbut die that time like i saidbugthanks in advance
id be inclined to think theres human error factor herebut still if its a valid bug this needs looking into
yes please
give me the op plus both of these the op suggestion is really minor but its a nice thing to have
supported  particularly that of aligning to bookmarks these things dont have to be as difficult as they currently are ingamehowever i would also like to evaluate whether this can give an unfair advantage to those avoiding pursuit

me thumbs up

if you think its boring autopiloting from 15 km why are you even autopiloting then if youre at the keyboard just manually enter in each warp to point and youll be finethis game is not built to be an instant gratification system you cant mount your dragon and head directly to whatever point you want you have to go through each system manually if you dont like this there are many other games which give instant gratificationwarp to zero was an idea that received a lot of flack back when it was released but its a good system for all im concerned they can even get rid of the whole autopilot option although it does have its uses so im not recommending this step in any wayif you think this game isnt automated enough there are other games out there ie jumpgate where you cant even warp to the next gate  you have to manually accelerate once youre pointed in the right direction then decelerate once you arrive there this is eve and you have to use what you have to reach your goalsi will admit that the suicide gank in highsecurity space is broken but thats why its being looked at by ccp changing the piloting system is not the answer to preventing suicide ganksim sorry for the rant but ive heard a lot about this idea and each time its by the vocal minority dont change the game i love to make it easier
because the very existence of the autopilot is a concession to the fact that its a very big game universe that most ships move through very slowly my principle is that the game shouldnt play for you at all im willing to make an exception for the autopilot for the aforementioned reason but i want the game to be significantly worse at playing itself than you are if you cant be bothered reading a thread that you come in to try to argue in then i cant be bothered heading over to your place to accommodate you
dont be ridiculous autopilot is for afk and if youre afk you wont be bored if youre at keyboard you can warp to 0 manually thus no problem what are you complaining about
if a window was ever made redock timer has to be 3 minutes
in empire wars its quite easy to spot a target and refit accordingly though i would not use it to strengthen the argument hence why i fitted out a ship with two specific and the rest general miscellaneous remote eccm doesnt really work very well when your solo and this is the problem for me falcons et al are making solo pvp boring falcons actually stop people from engaging and combat never happens and thus causing the game to get stale as much as speed
2 ships  1 ship so nerf falconsthe kind of people that falcons stop from engaging are the kind that would never give you the fights youre looking for anyway theres no possible way that you can balance 2 ships vs 1 ship without utterly breaking at least 1 of them
firstly i dont know how you can compare ecm to tds ecm jams 24 ships out of a fight at 200km tds are lucky to take one then rsds are worthless unless used in conjunction with ecmsecondly i see a lot of the time small gangs disengaging or not fighting because one side has a falcon or more pilots end up docking or warping off if i got attacked by a gang with a falcon most times i will disengage or try escape where if the falcon wasnt there perhaps i would stand my ground and fight actually a lot of the times falcons have actually saved me because i had nothing to do but try and escape thing is this thread isnt about falcon being overpowered its about eccm being underpowered
theres no reason to support this ccp is already working on doing something with eccm
i was trying to say that even a psychic with way too much money cant get as obscene as you might think i dont think i expressed that sentiment particularly well though 
give eccm and additional effect to make it usefull outside of just countering ecm
yeh i know im just gloating
after being pointed in the correct direction im posting a suggestion about an amendment to the reimbursement policy to cover for problems that are down to proven ccp server issues ive only noticed that this policy is unfair in my opinion after losing expensive fittings that id saved up for earning isk the correct way through hard work and hard hourson the day of server issues i logged on and started to do a mission my ship warped there fine but when i came to turn the modules on nothing happened and i noticed my shields starting to drop i then tried to align and warp but nothing happened and the next thing im in a pod it appeared that i was also warp jammed i started a petitionon checking the forums about the same time as my ship loss a thread had been created about the server issues attempting to log back in i saw warning messages about server issues which were not there beforemy wreck was left alone as knowing this was a ccp error and nothing to do with me at all i assumed i would get the ship back as it was and this was my first reimbursement petition reading the ccp policy it reads as though if the pilot is at fault which i certainly wasnt looting the wreck would have been hard due to the server issues and i wasnt sure if that was the right thing to do as i had petitioned it and it wouldnt be fair to have the items twice or have the petition refused for doing so i also shouldnt have to risk another ship to attempt to get the items back no matter what the costnow im thankful i got the ship back but i should have the items that were dropped when the ship was destroyed as this was 100 a ccp server error other people should be reimbursed for anything they loose due to a ccp errorjust a suggestion
this came up in another thread and the more i thought about it  the more i liked the idea  here it is add an option to the ship fittings similar to autoreload to automatically turn on specific fittings upon exit from warp this could be used upon exit from warp to turn things on  for example afterburners boosters and hardeners if you are cloaked these settings would have no effectthoughts
i was gonna say insta cloak at gate camps would be nasty at bestbut since you said if your cloaked as a qualifier this has my attentionid like to see more comments first
i can only assume you train 6 skills because otherwise this doesnt matter this whole time i was training energy management 5 and lost exactly 0 hours of game time while what you ask for wouldnt be unreasonable if you were say paying for time in a strip club this is eve and we already deal with a dayly server outtage called down time set a long skill when you can log in and quit crying the 50 sp you lost in the time you were gone wont make that much of a difference in how long you get into bobgo back to your whining cave
diapers cry whine emoragequit etcwhat passes for chivalry on the internet is interesting in the eve forums it comes out as a delectable mix of pompousness and aggressiveness and its actually a mark of immaturity from the people that cant rationally weigh the merits of various options and consider what might make views that they oppose plausiblehaving your skill train is a passive form of participation in the game it is what gives you character continuity however it is active play ie logging in and flying about that makes the game an activity when i buy 60 days of game time i should get 60 actual days of active game time not counting the scheduled outages as mentioned in my first post if there are outages and issues that is fine since it is to some extent inevitable however the time lost should be on ccps coin and not the consumersif you really in the depths of your heart where you are honest with yourself and not just defensively lashing out on people on an internet forum believe that skill training is adequate gameplay and equal to it then no increment of substituting logged in active gameplay with passive skill training should bother youin that case ive got some 60 day never log in skill train cards to sell you 3499 a pop i know you might be the kind of player that might use them up training some very large ship but then what is it really the same
i dont really see where you were abused you post your opinion about what might be a good change to you and most people think it is a ridiculous idea smacking of entitlement syndrome some good natured ribbing followswhats the problem i think this is an unbelievably good game and has great support better than anything ive seen we play in this hugely complex virtual world for about 5 cents an hour but you want to be reimbursed for every minute that you dont get to play because of some unforseen system problem i think that is totally unresonable you claim that you are a savvy consumer well when you installed ccps software on your computer you clicked the accept button during the software install as a condition of having the privlege to use ccps software before clicking that accept button you were given the opportunity to read the eula and click the decline button if you did not agree to ccps methods here savvy consumer is what you agreed to cut and pasted from the eulano warrantiesthe software system game and all game content and all other services and material provided in connection therewith are provided as is with all faults and without warranty of any kind you assume all risk of use and all risk associated with accessing the system and playing the game ccp disclaims all warranties whether express or implied including without limitation the warranties of merchantability fitness for particular purpose and noninfringement there is no warranty against interference with your enjoyment of the game ccp does not warrant that the operation of the system or your access to the system or that your use of the software will be uninterrupted or errorfree nor that the system or software will be compatible with your hardware and software while ccp attempts to have the system available at most times ccp does not guarantee that the system will always be available or that the system will not become unavailable during game play the system may become unavailable for a number of reasons including without limitation during the performance of maintenance to the system for the implementation of new software for emergency situations and due to equipment or telecommunications failuresobviously you have changed your mind about the eula and it is entirely within your right as a savvy consumer to cancel your subscription without being reimbursed for time not used of course
what ccp has the right to do on the one hand and what they should do for the sake of fairness or customer service may be two different things ccp may very well have strongarmed its customers into accepting all kinds of terms which its customers explicitly accept as terms of use in fact it is somewhat typical for the more ruthless and unscrupulous businesses to write all kinds of things in the clauses of a contract for something people very much want but my argument is not about what ccp is legally obligated to do it is an argument about what they should do in order to be fair
whats fairyou would dare use such a word in the context of eveonlinepfft i learned the hard way theres no such thing as fairnothing in life is ever fairits what you make of itall your doing is throwing a fit over a few nickles to a measly 25 centshonestly the only way your going to get compensated is if the outage is signiificant not to mention repetitiveif your that sore about it then leave or subscribe to the bloody gameeither way your crying over spilt milkim quite pleased im getting all of this and more for a measily 14 bucks a monththe only way im going to change my mind on the matter is if the outage is 1 to 3 days longthen im going to get upsetits not the end of the world if i cant play eve at the end of the day  happens as they sayof course if it was every week again id be upsetthis is a matter of rationality and reason not your bloody pocket book
whats fairyou would dare use such a word in the context of eveonlineyes because there is a distinction between the content of the fictional universe that is the game and the realworld business that provides the game if i walk into a bookstore to buy the latest thugcrime novel and when i proceed to pay at the front desk the clerk punches me in the nose and takes my wallet that is unjust and unacceptable even if the characters in the novel that i purchase also act that way if i say to the clerk that was criminal and uncalled for and the clerk responds you dare to talk about whats criminal when purchasing a book about thug life i should blow your head off right now his response would be absurd your appeal to some claim that a business can be unscrupulous because the fictional universe that it sells is about lacking scruples is absurd for the same reasonsand again the reference to monetary compensation is out of place this thread is already littered with that equivocation because that is not what i argued for im putting out the suggestion that ccp should add the game time that was lost by unscheduled outages not that they should toss me some nickels and dimes it is not uncommon for businesses to credit consumers for time when a service was not used due to some breakdown or issue on the side of the business where the consumers had paid for a longer period of use of that service in advancenow what i find interesting in your response is that you seem to admit that there is a threshold at which you as a customer would think that ccp was giving you the short end of the stick so for you a one day outage starts to be your boiling point this is interesting because it seems to cross over from the ccp canshould do whatever it wants side into the side that concedes that ccp can be out of line and unfair even if it is within the terms of its eula in other words you agree with me and just differ over the threshold of when consumers should seek redress im open to that kind of discussionoh and the word is measly not measily  im not pointing that out to land sucker punches at you im just pointing out the misspelling and also its no longer 14 bucks a month ccp upped the ante on what they charge us remember the various moves by ccp to shake more money out of the pockets of its customers are part of what makes fanboy consumers finally become a bit more critical and motivates some of the closer attention to ccps recent business practices

ccp really wants to stop us from ghost training fine lets give them thatin return because we are as important as those keeping the servers online or maybe even more ccp should rerelease 30d and 90d gtcswasnt one of the main and most important reasons for their removal the abuse of ghosttraining from the part of the players through the use of certain gtcs
so you want to penalise people more for disconnectingno
neither did i but hey
logoffski is against eve rules no one here is talking about punishing logoffs were trying to find a solution to logoffski
 x  the ninja salvager should be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because the mission runner owns the wrecks and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamicnot only change it but ensure that the mission runner cannot be aggroed in return by the salvager when he decides to return in a fully fitted pvp shipmission runners risk losing their ship to a bad spawn aggro the salvagers run no risk at all most salvagers now opt to steal loot so as to return in fully fitted pvp ships to gain a navy bs kill on their killboardsmission runners own the wrecks in my opinion and should be allowed to defend their gains without the ability of the salvager to aggress within a timeri use inverted commas around the word salvager as more often than not the whole reason for probing a mission is to gain aggro on the mission runner thus making profit from the mission runners faction modsmwds cannot be used in deadspace so how hard would it be for ccp to alter the salvaging rules there toohi sec is not a safe place for the most ardent of carebears as it is and whilst i appreciate not everyone likes pve alone those that do should be made safer if everyone could run a mission without the fear of ship or isk loss surely this would help to reduce the macro users and isk buyers pvp chars could then run legitimate alts purely for isk making via mission runningbesides if a salvager wishes to make money from his proffesion take it to lo sec roid belts and enter into a risky business and stop profiteering from players just wishing to mind their own business
no never going to happen and most mission runner killers i know dont really care about the navy bs kill what they want are the faction fittingsdang then those mission runners who loose their ship in a mission must suck at running missions ive been running missions for two years and have never lost a ship in onethe salvage belongs to the first one that gets to it thats what ccp always says anyway
the only time a mission runner faces any risk is when they screw up
very true sir but there is still an element of risk albeit if it is from their own stupidity there should imho be a risk to the thief  salvager
the salvagers risk being shot by the ppl they steal loot from if they arent interested in the loot and they are just salvaging they arent hurting you as wrecks are out there for anyone to salvagebut honestly i dont care if it gives aggro mission runners should either a pvp the salvager and be willing to face the consequences for firing on him win or loose or b ignore there is nothing that salvaging does that directly prevents you from finishing the mission where as stealing the loot can hence loot theft should give aggro while salvaging shouldnt but again like i said cba to care
after a bit of thought my opinion isx the ninja salvager should be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because the mission runner owns the wrecks and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamici feel its a risk vs reward thing if you find abandoned wrecks hey loot and salvage them if you want just be aware that there is a small risk that the person they belonged to might see you in the next fifteen minutes and care enough to shoot you personally i probably wouldnt care enough to shoot someone who had lootedsalvaged from wrecks i had abandoned if you can manage to salvage andor loot a mission someones still doing more power to you but where there is reward there should be risk  and the risk here is not great since a mission fit ship probably will not have a warp disrupterone thing i might think about changing however is allowing wrecks to be tractorable by anyone to prevent abuse however this should result in an agression flag transferable salvage rights would also be cool

approving of such developments i am moar piratefaction lurve pleasethankyou 
what is your opinion on pirate gatecamps i am not saying it should be impossible but you say life is becoming harder for pirates due to some random stuff while gatecamping is only becoming easier for the pirates more people  larger gangs  easier to tank guns introduction of hics etc and while pirates seem to enjoy whining about being blobbed 25 vs 5 they dont have any issues ganking a noob 5 vs 1 somewhere in gd it was asked how you can get more people into low sec the answer many gave and what i also think decrease the number of gatecamps sure i know low sec isnt camped everywhere am often enough in low sec but if you run into a gatecamp you lose a ship without anything you can do about it i would have no issues with making it easier for pirates to find people in belts when low sec rats get improved but then it should be compensated by a nerf to their ability to gatecamp

isslers actually quite lovely theyre both quite lovely and their csm pages even mention some of the same things which leads me to believe theyre twins both trying to get elected to offset the harm or good the other would dobut which one is the evil onemeissas page has a photograph of a demon drinking beer though you dont see that every day
you got my vote prom best of luck
clearly i dont care for it
so youre like 2 months old bought isk with real money the legit ccp way and you think youre qualified to run for csm note most candidates are 2 years old and actually have real experience of evejust reading your viewpoints shows how inexperienced you are and how much you completly lack any eve knowledgelet me guess you hate scamming because if someone scammed you they would essentially be stealing rl money off you because you bought isk lol
i agree with celestin koening
hello and happy halloweenits time for my weekly update it occurred to me over the last week that many of you only interact with one another on the forums although this is not a bad thing it is not me i want to interact with the player base and frankly the player base is not asking questions on the forums in my opinion the 2nd csm will need to get out of these forums and into the game i see most of you interacting here in the forums every day 23 times and i assume that your talking and listening to your corporation and alliance but what about the other 99 of the pod pilots in this game they need to be heard and listened to we will not be able to do our job in the csm and stay only in the forums of course the forums are a tool but not the only toolif anyone has questions about my stance on the many problems that need to be tackled in eve then feel free to speak out in local pm me rorincutteryahoocom or eve mail  convo in gamefly safe peoplerorin
oh my word you actually pointed in the air to bring up your bullet points i almost freaking died when that happened
ugh i wish i have never clicked your movie linknot only am i worried that english is clearly not your primary language the fact that you pointed in the air to highlight bullet points truly shows your lack of maturity and inability to efficiently lead this csm
this post has been cleared of inappropriate contentregardsthe eve online moderation team
and if my previous posts did not drive home the point i am trying to make you are clearly not qualified because you drive a fukken minicooper or something inappropriate contentapplebabe
csm candidates should not have two seperate threads please add the movie to your original candidate thread
