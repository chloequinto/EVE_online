i can get behind this
thanks ccp
i support this idea immenselyoption 2 would be extremely helpful in getting a players standings up whilst they do the faction repair plani think that an online petition in a board showing the amount of support would also be a good idea ill sign ittalemecus valta pvp cannon fodder valta industries
talemecus valtathanks for the support those agents use to be the very first step in the plan before ccp retired them im not sure how effective it would be to post this as an online petition in a board this proposal needs to be signed by eve characters and more importantly needs to be supported by the csm that would definitely get ccps attentiondmc
there already is one its called my guns you want to know whats in there then take the time to blow it up
bump
2 just ban two modules from plexes smaller than large cloak  wcs problem solvedi dont think i need to explain why
maybe bumping the post to keep it in the first page of forum posts to keep it visible for people to view would be the way to gothen readers can add their support whenevertalemecus valta pvp cannon fodder valta industries
yeah guess i could bump it up more often at least once a week along with a little help from my friendsi have a link to this proposal in both evelopedia page and forum thread for the faction standing repair plananyway thanks again for your supportdmc
i have commented in the past on other threads regarding this and i will do it again on this thread i fully support this simple request and see no way how it could possibly break the game it would make my eve experience much more enjoyable and there are plenty of options that can be implemented if decided in order to keep things in check

its simple UFFFD shut down blink lmao and make this an ingame mechanic i am not a gambler but many of my friends play blink why not rent a casino office out of a number of limited slots in stations or introduce a new capital ship called cruise ship or casino ship reinforced with strontium like a pos etc to avoid a nasty attacksurely ccp could find a legal justification to turn gambling to their advantage and out of the hands of 3rd parties
now this is just a thought and while i expect a little flaming for this its a legit question too there are a few common facts that can be pointed out1 concord does a good job killing the people that attack or attempt to kill you wronfully2 suicide ganking is a great way to make isk3 suicide ganking is in and of itself generally disliked by the community of carebears which i suppose is reasonable by itselfbut just a thoughthow much of an impact on eve would it have if concord not only took military action against transgressors but also took repair action in an attempt to protect the innocentits probably just a silly idea but i just wanted to throw it out there anyways if it sounds legit seems like an interesting thought if not oh well who cares generally my idea is that most gate campers and suicide gankers are fairly low in experience and are just looking for something to kill andor a way to earn isk granted there are quite a few experienced pvpers who gate camp and suicide gank as well i mean why not its certainly not illegal and the reprocussions you get for doing so are justified but from my understanding if you want to learn pvp invite someone to a duel toss a can out do it one on one go into lowsec and get into a fleet and have some real battles i tend to find blog gate camping and suicide ganking in or near high sec to be kind of pettythe real fights wars where eve lives and thrives is in nullsecbut really though why is it concord has all this amazing military strength but doesnt seem to give a crap about repairing anyonejust a thought  call me crazy if you wanna maalar
with the recent changes to command ships much love was spread around the nighthawk was brought up to par with its compatriots in the damagedealing arena but its tank is still little better than a drakes when fit for small gang combat read fit with a prop mod and warp disruptorscrambler thanks to only having 5 mids as such i propose the following add a 6th midslot by removing a low this will make the nighthawk more generally viable in pvp instead of limiting it to just fleet roles where tackle isnt required
i knew it as soon as ccp put this in place to satisfy the whiny bitches they came back and complained that it is not enough
after playing with new scanning interface a bit ive became a little dissapointed no signatures which dont dissapear when out of probes scanning range are great but new custom formations are pretty useless in theirs current state because despite you can split your probes into 2 groups of 4 which by the wiki is enough to scan anything you still cant move them as two separate groups and this means no one will care about this ability as moving probes one at a time is highly uneffective simply moving all 8 of them sequentially from one signature to another will be much more faster aside from that there is one other thing which make the scanning process quite tedious and wristhurting  job this is because its totally based on mouse controls which is worst thing one can face when doing highly repetitive based on simple common patterns task for hours so what exactly should be changed1 hotkeys for every scanning action are needed those include initiating the scanning process gathering your probes changing formations switching between 2 splited formations see below positioning of each formation its very inconvinient to drag and drop it and prone to missclicking when you accidentally drag it for arrows point new positioning hotkey should work as this immideatly reposition currently selected formation to the mouse cursors position in the same plane2 as stated above ability to split probes in two individual independent formations3 some way to estimate probes disposition also is needed currently its often hard to tell how much belowabove the plane where signature being scanned are your probes are situated until youve rotated camera a bit to check it from other angles something similar to tactical overlay in combat would be of great help here
also blocking npc chars option would be handy

i represent a community of the best explorers in one of the only exploration corps in eve along with all our friends many of us are old regulars in the exploration chat channel and now hang out in the booty tiki bar post odyssey i get to hear the same issues brought up over and overthe elephant in the room odyssey did not make exploration more interesting profitable or more fun the hacking minigame and pinata style scatter container mechanic in profession sites is both hated and enjoyed but ultimately these mechanics do not have much of an effect on the gamethe greatest changes in odyssey that effect exploration the most area scanning is much easier and the trained skills for scanning are far less relevantandb the removal of npc rats from profession sites data and relic in all space with the exception of wormhole space and drone regionsprofession sitesodyssey saw a flood of new explorers running profession sites for about three weeks this caused all the materials from those sites to crash on the market and continue to crash months later finally some of those items have begun to level off in price but since so many people are sitting on the items until prices go back up it is unlikely they will ever be restored with the current state of the gamethis means that where explorers previously were able to get 520 mil from a highsec radar site preodyssey are now lucky to get 2 million from said site in highsec comparatively in lowsec magnetometric sites now called relic sites used to occasionally give 50 to 100 million isk but those items have crashed as wellin this 6month price history chart is a typical decryptor found in data sites  notice the alarming crash starting in juneimg
i second this taking the rats out of profession sites i believe was a huge mistake yes it encouraged people to get out and explore but it also made the items that come from profession sites over saturated on the market making scanning easier is a double edged sword as well i couldnt tell you how many dead ships i have seen in ded 410s from rookie pilots with absolutely no idea with what they are doinglast night i found a dead deimos in an angel 410 it used to be you had to have skills to cherry pick scanning and now anybody can do it even at low skills you can launch probes and start your scan at 8au and get whatever it is at 100 within a few sweeps with 11 the red dots staying on the screen even while scanning down another siteall you have to do is move the probes over at 2au or so and youll get it odyssey was touted as an expansion to exploration but really it was just a dumbing downwrapped in bubble wrap and delivered in a shiny package
1 these are very positive proposals that would greatly enhance exploration sorry ccp but what you created was a detriment to exploring and needs to be changed
this is exactly what is wrong with exploration since odessey was implented ccp took away the ability to make isk in high sec with the changes for relic and data sites i used to run these sites in the past with the chance of making good isk from them now they arent even enticing because of the low return also with the new skills it makes it easy for new pilots to find the sites but they are unable to run them changes need to be made to enhance all skill levels
this has come up when we come across a completely new player who wants to get into exploration and it is hard for them to do anything other than profession sites which no longer pay what they used to mining could pay more now they have to wait a pretty good while to competently run the ded 310s and 410s no complaints about that when profession sites were worth running until they could get their combat skills up but now it isnt the case
youve got my 1 for this in fact it should be implemented this way1 scanning has some newbiefriendly casual interface to assist begginers in climbing learning cue  exactly as it has currently2 one can only scan very simple highsec sites with least expensive loot in them while using it3 if youve became dissatisfied with what you get in those you can switch off casual interface and start to become accustomed to more challenging manual controls this will be enough to scan any site until you are staying in highscecs but not without some mental workout4 while you are hitting lowsecnull space not that you are have to use this complex manual controls now but the riddle you have to solve to successfully scan the site becomes even more complex sometimes you will have to accept that you current skill level and equipment you are using wont enough to scan it at all despite all the effortas for rats i adhere to the suggestion above that they are should only spawn after unsuccessfull hacking attempt in all sites except for those for total newbies
there is zero chance that ccp will deploy this content before star citizen does ccp is going to sit tight and count their initial player losses when citizen goes lie next year they will let citizen lead the way while stemming what losses they can and look for areas what fans hate and design their products around thatwould you rather cross a mine field first or follow in some ones foot steps
because it isnt their responsibility andor they dont careseriously why would they care about the lives of immortal demigods however innocent they may seem and their dime a dozen crew life isnt exactly a precious or a scarce resource in the universe of eveplus no matter how nonviolent the activities you partake in you contribute in some way to someone elses war machine including those that are a potential threat to the empires themselvesokay enough rp stuffwhy should peoples safety be increased in highsec more than it is convince me using an argument other than i dont like it otherwise its fine as is
ill just say as someone who mostly could be described as a carebear we at least have a responsabikity to engage in an activity known as cya cover your a
i do find that assertion funny and rather silly but it makes clear why you posted such a bad ideadestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
andwhat is the proposal here
for concord not only to act as punisher but also as logistics for the great unwasheddestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
as a dedicated carebear with knowledge of nulllow securities i dont like this idea eve is not a pve or a pvp game  its a market game and as such the pvpers take care of the balance of power you should thank them for helping the gristmill of the economic engine runi cannot support this idea while i dont like the activity of pvp highsec is already too safe the only thing i would support is that concord takes action against criminals maybe by increasing their response times where the perpetrator is of low security status or attacking those deep enough outrightremember to thank the suicide ganker next time for keeping the wheels of commerce running smoothly ive been ganked before too and lost over 10b isk but thats eve for ya and isk faucets arent too hard to come by play smarter with tanking and repping on your industrial  especially now with the revised industrial ships
as a nighthawk pilot that solos 710 and 810s i agree i need an extra slot so i can fit a ab to reduce my gate transit time while i lol semi afk through this plex there is zero chance youll get an extra mid slot im dealing tengucnr damage while sig tanking like a boss and applying dps to frigs with my precesion heavies unlike the cnr and to some extent the tengu which must orbit out of range to survivewhy are you trying to fly a pve or pvp support hull as heavy dps  tackle
would you say that the sleipnir is a support hull what about the astarte or absolution are those also support only personally my kill record with the sleipnir and absolution ive never flown an astarte would say otherwise but your mileage may varythe simple fact is that the nighthawk is lacking in something the other command ships are fully capable of the ability to tackle in pvp without making itself a loot piUFFFData

im not going to read through all the comments but i would like to say this rigs and fittings do not make it too powerful its a non combat ship why the hell should it be easy to kill  so you can have your loot and not have to work for it f me lads yaall can always find something to moan about1 for the idea i think it would be useful logistically perhaps only usable in highlow sec  then jfs move the ships to nullonly usable in these regions due to gate mass limitations or something would also be nice if the ship was scaled right so it looked as tho 3 battleships actually fitted in it
plus 1 from me
from context i assume he means players in npc corps
i dont feel making it easier to exclude dust mercs would be helpful for the hopefully growing integration between games
while i feel that 10 tax on highsec pi is bad enough if it were accurate i feel that its worse that the 10 tax is actually closer to a 1520 taxexample consumer electronics cost 900 isk to export which means the assumed value is 9000 isk per unit in reality consumer electronics are valued around 40006000 a unit which essentially means we are paying 900 isk per 5000 isk of value 18while many suggest making the high sec tax rate lower id like to suggest keeping the tax rate the same but having the value of the goods being imported and exported actually updated daily use the global average as the taxable amount and tax rates will actually be appropriate to the goods
the problem is that we told ccp this kind of thing would happen back when they first imposed these really high taxes on pi goods aaaaand they ignored us
lets hope they quit ignoring us then 
1 i agree with this things need to change to make exploration a viable profession to skill into anymore ever since i started exploration drone regions were useless when this expansion came out i was certian they would distribue the loot evenly atleast
if ccp intends to make exploration in general an important part of the game then they should act that way it should be challenging and rewarding i dont mind the hacking minigame per se or the spawn hunt that follows but it is a bit annoying it might be fun for new playerswhat i really mind and why i give an enthusiastic 1 to maxs suggetions regarding rewards is that the rewards seem to have been heavily nerfed spawns from all the combat sites are meh after the patch highsec they are barely interesting to even new players unless one spends an inordinate amount of time scanning and running sitesif exploration drops are a way of controlling the economy allowing ccp to adjust cash flow into the economy why not come out and admit it if not why not give exploration its dueexploration should be a legitimate eve profession with high rewards for training skills and developing strategies if ccp agrees with this it should act that way if it does not then please let them say so and we can get on with our gaming knowing exploration is at best a sidelightthanks again to max for his time and i hope ccp through the councils input responds appropriately and with due diligence

i fully support the three filters for the local channelalso your selection should be preserved so it remains when you gate to new system and when you log off and back inedit deleted a comment that i made because im a moron who apparently cant read englishjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
um most of the stuff we get from sites are sold to other players so there is no cash flowing into the economy it is just changing hands only the overseer effects bounties and blue loot in wspace are isk fountains as far as i am awarei am not convinced of this it might be a factor but surely not the reason im more thinking of more supply by easier scanning and people were soo afraid to lose their dsps coupled with other factors like the one you mentioned and sellout of stacksotherwise i a with you my two main gripes are that every person now sees signatures  imo you should at least be in a ship that intends to probe  and the no rats weirdness that are profession sites now i can sort of see the relation of more salvage from relic sites to the new capital rigs but as far as data sites go there is only more supply not more demand
keep middle mouse button pressed move mouse ship turns in the desired directioni know about ship agility i know some ships would turn very slow right now if i want to do the exact same thing turn the ship in some random direction i use double click not easy to use and not feeling like i control the ship the method i propose would give make the space battles feel more real and we could better feel the ships mass when trying to turnits one of the first things i tried to do in the game when i downloaded a trial  turn my ship it was 50 of the fun of a spaceship game after that  i gave up and did not play for 1 year because the game felt too complex and  i could not even fly my ship so  right now manual turn is possible using double click please make it possible using the mouse see the i was there video imagine doing that with double clicks i mean  yes people do that using the spiral approach to dodge fire but with double clicks its not as immersive
1 i really dont care completely honestly i dont give a crap it was an idea and i could honestly care less of the outcome2 obviously you didnt understand the purpose of the proposal you would still duel can flip and war dec it just brings to question why concord would blast away the bad guy and let you perish if youre going to take any goodsameritan action then why not repair ships being wrongfully attackedit is a thoughtprovoking idea however either way i dont care i just wanted to put it out there take it as you will

yup many pi setups are uneconomical because of the fixed tax rate theres already estimated prices ingame so if they could be used to derive taxes thatd be great
go to lowesec
quotemnemosyne gloob every person now sees signaturesquoteif this were simply skill based it would solve a lot of problems as well  for example astrometrics trained to level 5 to have the ability to see cosmis signatures in a maximum radius of oh  64 without launching probes or simply bring back a probe that can cover the entire system like the deep space scanner probe but require astrometrics to level 5 to be able to use itfunny how the scanning bug lately where you cannot see the red globes when looking at solar system map gave the more skilled explorers a temporary break from competition last night one of my friends found 6 410s with no competition he rgiped about the scanning bug at first and i said oh youll get used to it just fine
they pissed away years on wis and look what we got you think another 18 months of putting spaceships deelopment on ice and we might get a second room maybe een get to do dance emotes and see another aatar without your graphics card melting down the engine is a horrible system hog and would likely need a major work to run acceptably with any worthwhile content its not worth sacrificing what little spaceships content we do get for fluffwis was only eer a testbed for the world of darkness engine and that game seems to hae been cancelled or at least put ery much on the back burner so dont expect much progress on space barbie
if you dont care then why post crap idea
why not give people with changed names a little marker in local maybe another colour a little star in front or at the end of the name perhaps only for the first 46 weeks after the change

this many lowsec systems acfually have very good taxrates yes on player pocos because some corps use them as a secondary incomepi resource levels are better out there too
there are 26 pi products out of 53 p2 p3 and p4 products that are unprofitable to make only due to the cost of taxes on a highsec planetid say thats pretty broken that you must make 26 pi products at a poco but that is afterall just my opinion
i did a search and didnt find a serious proposal for this or any notion of a comment on it but im sure its a general assumption that this would be a really great inclusion to evei know eve stands with the no more than 24 hours skill training rule thats alright but what about skill planning its obviously a huge part of eve online just about anyone and everyone is recommended to get evemon and eve fittingtool or evehq it almost bears to questionwhy dont we already have this it seems almost like an obvious item that should be in eve and shouldnt take too much to implementi for one dont like the idea of thirdparty tools the more software you add to the computer the more vulnerable it can get while they work nicely id prefer to trust only one software vendor and not three or four on top of that it reduces the fullscreen functionality i like to not have to tab out of eve unless i really want tosoevemon ingame or a good variation thereof is a proposala fitting tool is a proposal as well being able to build fits ingame without having to actually buy the materials andor the ship just to see the stats should be an ingame functionality in addition the ability to make multiple plans for skills or to develop automat skill plans based on your current skills and the items requested would be an excellent entryoverallpropose to include ingame skill planning fitting tool with any ship and any module even if you do not own the item quite yetthank you
because i can and because i wanted to no idea is crap if you dont like it thats your perogative doesnt make it stupid i retract the proposal please lockdelete thread
there are a lot of players that seek solo pvp and its not so easy to findhow to encourage solo pvp my ideas multiply the ransom if a pirate player is killed with no help increase the chance to drop modules if another ship is killed with no help add a honor rating that can be selected in overview it increases with every solo kill or loss honorable players can see each other and maybe fight  monthly or weekly tournaments organized by ccp  kept very simple sign up in game with a npc agent for roleplay there is a system selected by ccp where scanning does not work be there at the time there are no stations and the system is closed once the tournament begins nobody can bring more than 1 ship any ship  so a merlin can get paired with a vindicator this keeps the randomness of real solo pvp then a ccp person has a giant list and teleports the players in pairs of 2 to various places inside the system with a timer of 10 minutes  then all pods get teleported out of the system if there are draws they can fight again with other opponents if they were not able to kill anything in 10 minutes then repeat until 1 remains the system will be closed to prevent others joining but players would be able to get out if they wantcan decide they dont want to lose the ship they just lose the place in the tournament 2000 participants means  11 ten minute fights to get to 1 thats 110 minutes  30 for organizing thats something like 2 hoursyes  it would not be fair for new players with cheap ships same as random solo pvp i just tried to make it simple so maybe it will be implemented if the ccp would want to get complicated and use ship categories it would be ok with me winners get nothing except what they loot edit maybe winners get standing with the npc agent corp that is a new corp same as other npc corp with agents and missions but players can gain lp and standings with every solo fight they get intoalso ccp could broadcast the most interesting fights and get some publicity the tournament could also use teams of 2 310  with the same rules everything allowed win or lose for more interesting fights if there are too many who sign up  maybe more systems to accommodate them or a lottery but if it turns up these tournaments are popular why not create the conditions for themmaybe even automate them like some barbarian war games that take place in no mans land i know for sure i would be participatingplayers who run from their opponents by exiting the system  would find themselves on the gates in the nearby systems where the cheering crowd will welcome them 
balance of ships for 1v1will not be required because players can use all ships and people will just use the best and because eve is so complex there will never be a best shipmaybe it will be somehow automated like a battleground in wow rewards being  the loot from the enemies and standings towards the npc corp players would talk to the agent join as 1 or as a team of  110 with the option of fighting a team of 110 if i join as 1 and accept fighting 23 my problem maybe even selecting the class of shipsthen they get to the system where the tournament takes place ccp offers no help for players to travel once inside they find themselves in a safe and are teleported to another safe when there is another team suitable with as many opponents as selected or lone enemy ready to fight if after a battle the team loses a few members  they will be paired with a smaller team and so on these fights would go on forever with no final winner pods would be encouraged to exit the system by npc hunting them and the inability to place bookmarks there would be an exit to a low sec system so pods dont end up dead when exitingthe tournament systems would have no station same as nearby systems after losing al ships  players exit the system then they can come back maybe after a delay
solo pvp is already perfect it never was about gaining isk and i hope it never will be besides that if one decides to solo that chances are heshe will looses more that gainsas a solo pvper i dont wanna be marked by anything also i dont want other solo pvpers to be marked i sort of dont want to know whats coming this would actually damage solo pvp as it is giving it some kind of template you get this honourable almost arranged 1v1 fights in a lot in fw and in rvbthe tournament would only work if its ship class restricted and that would be quite boring to watch unless people would bring golems and vindicators to compete which would never happen because the price is so low i can get a better price by running fw sites and having honourable pvp all day everyday with t1 frigatesdont touch mah sandbox 
ok forget the mark the tournament would not exist for making isk and people will join for fun are you saying that people will not seek fun in this game only isk they will bring what they have what they can afford to lose to have fun fun being  1v1 or 3v3 with whatever class of ships they use and whatever class of opponents they select there will be no survivors  if running away the gates at exit will surely be camped and there would be a lot of fighting outside between people trying to get to the tournamentif you want blob  its easy to obtain outside of the tournament if you want solo pvp its not easy to obtain you can obtain it using my idea and this does not mean you are a carebear maybe you are elite pvp and select  i fight with my frigate against 3 opponents of any kind the tournament does not make it easy it just provides you with fast fightsfrom a roleplay point of view  its easy to imagine a pirate corp creating this tournament in lawless space yes but we should be able to blob the pirate corp and everyone at the tournament then  you should also be able to destroy everything in the game destroy concord and so on concord puts limits in the sandbox the tournament system would just add something not limit anything
getting these kinds of fights is extremely easy in rvb or in fw why would i need to risk my ship to actually go in this arena system if its camped for sure im not getting out of that arena alive so that limits the engagements back to t1 frigates the same as in fw or rvb but with added risk of getting smart bombed when jumping into the arena system and most definitely getting ganked when leaving it if you just want to have fun there are already sandbox institutions for that
or full ransom paid to the person who kills them solojust like nowand make solo ganking in highsec even more hilariously profitable to the right person yeah sounds greatverily and foorsooth we shalt joust with the most honourable of intentions this day to defend yonder virgin maids chastity prepare yourself ye swinetwo concepts for you wasted dev time and sandbox pvp reasons to never do tournaments like that ever
the ops system requires large amounts of instancing to function that makes it an automatic no from me
i recently started pi and have discovered to my chagrin that if you miss a route on a facility it will continue wasting your materials until you make the discovery not only is this a ludicrous concept given the general mechanics of research and manufacturing in the game but its completely insane to think that a production facility anywhere ever is going to just take a finished product and dump it in the garbagei propose a change to how planets display information for their facilities for instance right now it blinks orange if there arent any resources available or there are no resources coming in however theres no way to tell if there is a route going out and adding a bit of a buffer on item storage for production facilities you cant set a route for finished products between facilities but you wont just toss it all in the trash if there isnt a routelets get this to ccp so we can at least get it in the queue of things they can take a look at
modern graphics cards hae no problem working with wis and im not asking for putting spaceship deelopment on holdif by horrible system hog you mean competitie with other modern games then yes it is

yes some work on wis pleaseive only been waiting years for that door to open incarna is the most unfinished feature of the game because its the only one they cancelled half way in
1 ccp is not making money off of isboxersib thats blissfully ignorant isboxers run ganks on multibillion isk ships that only isbs can then sell the scrap of the kills for plex begin end begincycle not to mention the mining opsplex are only worth money when bought with money ccp isnt making  off this2 it is detracting from player interaction if these puppeteers were to have to organize real players to do this wed have more people in corps and alliances rather than 3 4 and 500 long list of npc corporations every day in short why train new players when i can plex 15 account and do what i want and not have to ever use my micmore players doing more and with other players this is still an mmo right not home world 3 yet i dont care what they do gankers pirates whatever i care that other players are losing out on learning friendship interaction thats the spirit of the game right thousands of players in one shardsandbox all interacting not 5 guys with 2000 accounts each going head to head3ccp loses new players who cannot keep up with the joneses here again ccp makes nada and instead is losing paying new accounts if i start a game as a rookie and not long ago i did and i realize that players are buying 30 gunships accounts with 8 guns each to field i can never hope to keep up thereUFFFDs no challenge there that just repetitious lemmingism 3 itUFFFDs not eula cheating agreed but dont paint it as the savior of the game either itUFFFDs shady as hell at best and if youve been on the end of it and realize that you just got ganked because some dude has a piece of software installed not that hes a leader organized with a trained crew or good and skilled at what he does with experience but can instead run an app for that lets not paint all of us as so lazy as that i run 2 accounts in two completely different sides of the galaxy 4 isboxers must be and this is an observation the most friendless lonely antisocial people in the world this game has a built in system to allow people to invite anyone to come play with them for 2 months free basically they cant find people to invite talk about missing the new playersaccount boat holy crap oh yeah ccp raking it in iUFFFDm certainthats the easy button that for so long this game has tried to avoid isnt it 1 player with 240 blaster cannons at the click of one buttoncan ccp stop it no or at least not unless they start doing what the nsa does no comment they should have stopped it at as soon as it started they didnUFFFDt so now we all get a delicious goat poo pie to choak down while they figure it outshould they endeavor to discover a way to prevent it you beti think if ccp was making such cream off this cow theyd be pushing to find a way to directly integrate the function and sell it to people with multiple accounts monetize monetize monetizeor well have someone shooting the statue in jita saying the same things we did before no transactions that allow people to buy win no 3rd party apps that allow people to buy win either didnt darius johnson show a goon console and everyone laughed at his presentation in 09 like it was a joke and then someone took it seriously and made it work
except if they officially integrate gambling into their game then alot of players can get screwed sicne several governments already have passed around the virtual items should have a taxable value law those same countries would toss around the gambling is illegal in our country even if its for virtual currencyitems

thanks for the support mate its appreciated rally all the denizens of new eden you can this idea must not be allowed to silently pass into the nighti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
dear csmi recently experienced a highsec gank that i thought was a complete exploit of eve and the material extraction profession ice and asteroid harvesting i have read and witnessed gank after gank in highsec where the typical aggressors are t1 meta 01 destroyers piloted by experienced players how can it be that a corp of very low security status including its members can clone jump or pod race to a high sec station fit a destroyer undock warp to a scout at 0 km and melt down a ship without consequence yes their ships are either destroyed by concord or they selfdestruct 4m isk yes their security status is lowered but now they can increase it again by tag ratting in lownull sec space their objective is only to destroy ships disrupt market activity and generally be a pita things have gotten so bad recently that it is nearly a fruitless effort to mine or ice players wanting or needed raw materials need to create a fleet with combat and logistic support when will the game mechanics change to drastically limit aggression towards high sec barges  exhumershere are my suggestions1  2 warp core strength to all exhumers2  increase the resistance bonus from 4 per level to 8 per level yes make it high for this class of ship3  reduce the drone bay to 25 m3 if needed4  grant a shield boosting bonus of 75 per level5  if 1 thru 5 are not possible then provide concord and the navy ships with logistics to allow the ship to escape and survivein short give the material extraction pilots a fighting chance to flee and save their ship all bets are off if the bargeexhumer pilot start the aggression i look forward to your thoughts and those contributing to a better eve
suicide ganking has been around for as long as eve has been in existence ccp has never classed it as an exploit by evidence of them never implementing mechanics to outright stop it even though they do have the ability to do sothat said it is not ccps or concords responsibility to ensure your survival the onus is on you highsec is safer not safe relative to lowsec and nullsec a few csm members dont see why suicide ganking should be nerfed again the automatic consequences of suicide ganking are a 100 of the gankers ship with no insurance given and loss of security status beyond that it is up to other players to enact consequences against the offenders the game can and should only do so much for you again the onus is on youhint use those killrights you have against the ones who maintain positive security status people who regularly suicide gank dont even both using tags4sec last i checked it takes 200 million to go from 10 to 00 which isnt worth it if youre going to nose dive back down to 10 again you already have the ability to defend against suicide ganks its called tanking your ship andor using teamwork yes you will mine less andor hold less ore andor make less isk per m3 of ore in a ship that has been tanked and is working together with others this is the tradeoff for increased safetyif you are really paranoid though and dont want to use teamwork get a procurer it was specifically designed to take punishment 65k effective hitpoints ftw destruction is good for the eve economy and any significant disruption of the market is considered a monumental achievement that is to be applauded given its enormous volume
its just a matter of consequencesthe consequences do not match the offensecriminals have free reign of space even after destroying your shipthere is no law even in the highest of empire systemsconcord is not a law enforcement even though the wiki saysconcord ded divisionthe main responsibility of the ded is to track highprofile criminals for this they often hire independent contractors better known as bounty hunters the ded handles the licenses and legal issues of all bounty hunters for the empires although some of the empires have been known to bypass the ded in special circumstances also the most notorious criminals are marked as freeforall targets by the ded this doesnt even stop a known criminal from dockingconcord wont stop them from blowing up you ship but they will only blow up thiersat that point the can dock buy a new ship and go back at it or go buy tags4sec in low sec or use the ones they brought with themsaid negative status should imply a penalty or tax to purchase a new ship or equipmenta fee to undock should also be appliedunless they have used their tags4sec to impove their security statuseither way it will cost them to improve their sec status or fees to buy and try it againtheir should be a 30 day wait to biomass said character to prevent bypassing the penatlythat is one consequence idea
but theyd just have an alt buy the ship undock eject and let them board it
yet another gank whine threadeve is hard and brutal deal with it
honestly is the loss of two hulks your killboard im bored and its lunch time in three years really worth this much moaning im more than sure they payed for themselves many many times overif you want to solo mine use a mackinaw much better tank and cargo bay also fly smart dscan exists for a reasonabove all else please remember that in this game if someone really wants your ship dead it will die no matter how pimped buffed or what sec the space you are in
exhumers have been buffed and there are already mining ships specifically dedicated to tanking use the tools youve already been given
correct

forget the other ideas i still support my tournament automated ideasolo pvp in the sandbox jump around until i hit a gatecamp die or  try to scan people doing missions this means i have to come first with a scanning ship then change ship no i dont play with 2 accounts to check for gate camps or to scan with another character i want instant access to pvp against other people that want instant acces to pvp without being disturbed yes i can duel but a 3 v 3 is harder to organizewhy dont you want to be disturbed thats evil carebearyou will be able to attack players before they get there or if they try to get out also  there are lots of players sitting totally safe in stations making billions and you cant touch them because the stations are invulnerable npcs are cheating my idea does not involve that you will be able to kill me inside or outside of the tournament system
sorry but no
well then i suggest making all eve null sec with no npc stations or agents that would be a real sandbox new players would get into a null alliance from the start null alliances would have to compete for getting new players so they dont get outnumbered its not like i would enter the tournament to be safe even allow bubbles inside and no safety for pods if you wantmaybe add an option like selecting which players to be matched against with high priority so you can disturb who you want by constantly appearing as a tournament opponent this  if you can get there there would be escort fleets and fights going on outside a lot of content from my point of view
dude why are you pushing up ideas and have no idea how solosmall scale pvp works some of your sentences even show you dont know how eve itself works maybe try some institution already in existence which support this kind of pvp before creating ridiculous ideas yes you will get blobbedyes you will get falconized yes you will get bubbledyes you will die a lotyes thats what its all aboutyes we all love it your idea proves that you want to build a controlled environment inside a perfectly build sandbox game and try to patch it up with another ridiculous idea when people raise an issue about it the arena will never work because it destroys everything what eve my precious as sandbox game stands for
posting in a why cant eve be like wot thread
how about faction standings with the poco owned faction affecting the tax ratebetter standings with faction lowers base tax
oh god not a mouse again im already starting to hate this part of eve please more hotkeys for everything scanning especially for this particular case in addition to any mouse controls please add some wasd controls for it with ws controling so to say pitch and ad  yaw pretty please
this is eve we play spreadsheets online wot is that way
now its time for revolution ms office offline that way 
imo itd be a waste of development resources itd be another thing to make sure still works for every patch and would take continuing development time as well as the initial requirementsfurthermore i dont want to have to log in just to plan skills make a fitting etc i like the current situation where i have the ability to do those things on my phone a netbook that cant run eve etc finally having third party tools means that a ccp doesnt have to officially endorseseen to be supporting minmaxing b the playerbase has multiple options and c developers of third party apps only have to compete with each other increasing the overall quality of the programs
esteemed members of the factional warfare community we all know fw needs help currently there seem to be nothing but farmers in these fw sites plexes colloquially flying warp stabbed cloaky ships that run at the first hint of trouble from any size gang plexing is boring and the name of the game is warfare so i proposeloyalty point gain should be reworked to provide more points for engaging in combat than capping a plex obtaining a meager 120 lp for a kill is lame considering capping a medium plex will net you 3500  this would encourage more players to fit and fly rather than stab and run secondly the farmers will plex to the point where the faction lp is not worth as much and then change to the other side taking only a 24hour timeframe penalty to join the opposing milita to do it all again i think that there should be a period where you cant join the opposing side just like how you cant just ride back into hisec after deciding not to be a pirate anymore you should have to grind status or somethinglastly system tier bonuses are lame they should have something to do with the combat or rewarding of lp rather than adjust broker fees and pod prices thanks for reading

ok once again good evening all and to point there are some systems in eve eg sov space that have only say 1 belt in it so hears a little way i think ccp needs to do to counter this belt upgrade tire 1 gives to 5 belts for 50 mil a momthbelt upgrade tire 2 gives to 5 belts for 60 mil a momth belt upgrade tire 3 gives to 5 belts for 70 mil a momthi hope you feal the seam why as i do it may evean want more people out in sov knowing that they could alt not only rats and isk amount of the system but to change the belt lay out for extra isk per momth is a win win
suicide ganking is legitimate intended gameplay hisec is in no way intended to be safe and no profession should be immune from lossmining in a hulk is explicitly choosing to increase your gank risk in order to increase your income use a skiff if you dont want to be bothered the income will be lower thats the price you pay for lowering your risk
the fact that one or two characters can come come online for only a couple minutes a week and still maintain a war declaration is really quite annoying i think that the aggressors should have a certain amount of time collectively that any of the members would have to be online for each war week or the war becomes invalidated and costs a lot more to declare war for a week if this happens larger corps would have to have more time and smaller less i dont believe this would affect the people who are actively playing this game only those who log in briefly to pay fees or change skills wars should be able to be fought by both sides and when an aggressor wont come online there is absolutely nothing that the defender can do which would never happen in a war because if a soldier doesnt show they are awol and will be punished
i think ive heard before that fps style control would severely increase bandwith used to the point that people would rage over it especially during large fleet fightsalso as a subwarp race veteran and someone that used to be part of a formation flight team in eve i feel like im somewhat of an expert on the subject and i have this to add i dont really think it would improve immersion why because i see my doubleclicks as the commands niobe me shouts at morpheus the crew and the 2 second delay as morpheus the crew not keeping up with me
in an ideal world where ccp had infinite dev resources surein this one no id rather see those very finite resources employed in adding new gameplay functionality rather than replicating 3rd party support resources that everyone who uses them is very satisfied witheve has always had a very large constellation of communitysourced 3rd party resources and it would be a monumental task for ccp to satisfactorily replicate the functionality of evemon pyfa eft dotlan the jump planners eve survival the isk guide etc etc
making a kill worth more than the cost of the kill is an obvious farming loophole
so we just leave broke broken i get that it is most likely done like that to prevent killfarmingwhat about my other points
so like an ore prospecting array but massively better whats wrong with the one you already have
short awanser is fine in eddation was hoping you guys might like the idea of floating belts rather then more visable belts any how thanks for the comment
please understand that i am not whining i am pointing out that there are opportunities to improve the game mechanics like some have posted in this thread this is about a healthy and constructive dialogue clearly there are issues when i high sec gate camp near dodi can pop any ship they want mostly industrials simply because they want to
i agree with your suggestions there has to be more penalty than there currently is great thoughts
this is not my only character i posted that i was not working solo i had another character piloting an orca with logistics and other mining support it was not enough i do not afk mine and am watchful of local and scans it does not matter in a system with decent pilot activity
advice coming from goons i am not sure if i should heed it or toss it out with the trash
1  i have perfect skills with all forms of material extraction incluing ship bonuses2  i always fit a tank on all my ships3  i own and use a skiff that is heavily tankedi have seen pilots in deninard lose their skiffs to ganks even with a logistics support and in a group of skiffs there is still an issue in highsec please explain how a gang can pop a skiff with an ehp of 88k before the navyconcord can take appropriate action gank situation again reinstating the 2 warp strength the skiff once had would be a great place to startall material extraction pilots including myself have accepted the reduced dare i say diminished yields in order to survive what are your thoughts
there are plenty of areas of space we will call them rural hisec that are quiet and gankers tend not to go because there are a lot of targets in caldari hisec lets call that urban hisec to gank so why not move out to the country and away from the busy areas that the gankers run around in
my thoughts are that you have plenty at your disposal to be able to mine it seems that your looking for a way to tip the scales in your favor and no i dont think most people will agree with that so instead of asking for an entire reworking of industrial ship stats why not consider other options just a fewyou said your using more than one character replace one of their mining boost ships with an ecm cruiser gankers dont have much time to pull off a successful hit before being concorded so few will wish to attempt to engage a mining barge with a jamming ship on gridwhy not mine in lowsec pirates work out a deal i would be willing to let you mine in our system just because it will attract targets to you in turn giving us more people to shoot at no it wont guarantee absolute protection but you would have help from us just for being bait im sure other systems occupants would be willing to deal as well isk for mining privlages i wouldnt bring the orca though shyte you may even be able to pull off finding a lowpopulated lowsec system and mine in peace just look at the map and filter kills in last 24 hours there are many systems out there that arent heavily populated the intent was never to be able to conduct any profession in this game with no risk and i think that your suggestions would make mining ships untouchable but you know the thing is even if ccp did what you asked for the gankers would find a new way to deal with it such as fitting a few ships with many mid slots with nothing but scrams to counter your warp core bonus
we are in the country lol
thank you for your feedback just to clarify i suggested changes to barges and exhumers and not other industrials i think reinstating the 2 warp strength to the skiff is not asking much at all additionally i never asked for highsec or anything to be risk free nor would i ever suggest it yes there is always a counter move to every offensive and defensive move  such is life imo the ecm cruiser would be popped easily along with a barge and most exhumers but the idea warrants further thought and considerationit is possible we could work out a deal with material extraction in your system with provided protection contact me ingame if you would like to discuss this further
because in real lifejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
and likewise what happens if the aggressed corp dont log in do they forfeit all their stuff to the wardeccers
also did you really just create this character to post this ideai can understand maybe wanting to avoid extra war decs but if you really believe in your proposal manupjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
i donUFFFDt think that you are wrong to identify the aggressor as a problem but the problem is bigger than a single expected role in my opinion in fact renaming many of the terms used in the war system would at least manage expectations UFFFD war could be relabelled UFFFDdisappointmentUFFFD and the participants UFFFDunlikely to be suicidal corp 1UFFFD and UFFFDunlikely to be suicidal corp 2UFFFD rather than aggressor and defender UFFFD it would reflect what goes on far better than the roles that are stated but rarely fulfilleda big problem i see with the war system is that it allows for ridiculous ratios there is nothing a hundred people can do in a war against ten so you donUFFFDt bother trying war as far as i have experienced can not involve everyone that is involved especially if there is ever going to be any fighting a good mechanic has to be able to involve everyone and the current war system is almost designed to exclude people from the gamewhy not modify your idea into an additional feet fighting system separate from war that allowed for arranging times and places for fleet fights using a limited number of ships something along the lines of the alliance tournament a specific system is assigned for fighting so everyone still has the normality of high sec UFFFD heck it can be an ultra sec system to save breaking the universe and have concord manage fair play the fleets can be no larger than the membership of the smallest corporation involved and the victory condition the elimination of the enemy fleet three fights over a week winner gets an epeen extension the time of the fight or best match can be derived from the corps members activity so it is known in advance if the two corps time zones matchmoving scoring away from isk would also be nice tactical fighting with the best you can afford rather than the isk based shopping list that is the norm for a high sec fight UFFFD losing the battle but killing the most isk shouldnUFFFDt really be an aim entertainment should be above accountingit doesnUFFFDt have to be mutual just by invitation and recorded somewhere in the corp bio as some form of honour type rating turning up being as positive a thing as winningi realise that it would be slightly civilised to simply get on with the fighting in this way but it would serve to open up conflict to all those corps that really donUFFFDt want to waste a week on probably not shooting at anyonethat is not to say that war should be removed but it would need to be adjusted to reflect that you had ganking duelling and fleet fighting as well as low and null which all in provides a smorgasbord of combat opportunities currently there are corps that declare war in order to gank freely they have no interest in fighting and are only in it for the barges obviously with notice most people know to lock up the ships that these people want to shoot at making it a fairly pointless exercise for all in many casesi think the cost of war would have to be increased to a point where you would do it when you only do it when you wanted to take onout a corporation to take out its towers etc our towers have been floating in space poorly defended through countless wars without anyone even bothering to threaten to take them out let alone actually shooting at them our UFFFDaggressiveUFFFD enemies have always had plenty to shoot at just not the will or numbers both corps involved should have assets anchored in high sec space there should always be something for the other side to shoot at and the victory condition should be destroying those assets or not the aggressor and defender might even fulfil those roles if they have a reason to im not suggesting that shooting at towers would be thrilling but it would be a lot more interesting than the 161 hours of nothingness that war seems to currently providein addition to that a red vs blue type war should be accessible if wanted but that should be mutuali appreciate my pop poll is not scientific but the first corp in my current system has 3 kills and no losses after a total of 10 weeks of war UFFFD 1 kill for every 23 days of war they have enjoyed the next has 1 loss and no kills for 203 days of war fantastic fun i know that there are counter examples but in a system with 30 people in it a random one is not to hand nothing seems to happen in most wars based on where i am it would be nice to see some ccp statistics on high sec war what i can read for the corp iUFFFDm in suggests that we lose fewer ships when at war than not which is scary that is largely because if we do fight we outnumber the enemy which guarantees the aggressor wonUFFFDt come out to play the rest of the time i guess our members are not as suicidal as the system seems to require them to bei donUFFFDt know what the perfect answer is but as it stands it seems that removing the war system would entertain more people than retaining it in its current form i do think that there should be war but it shouldnUFFFDt be a ball and chain that the game has to drag around and i certainly agree that people seem to be wrongly tied to the idea that an aggressor is aggressive
another nerf hi sec thread surprise surprise makes me wonder about the op and his skills at ganking in many of the belts i mine in i frequently see many afk miners where it wouldnt matter if a ganker shows up red in local and on the overview their ship is gonna keep on mining or just sitting there in space because the last rock went pop its pure laziness if a ganker cant find a nice easy target
i disagree local only gives you a toon name and a sec status and corporation if someone takes the time to click on the box if a ganker does some ratting and gets his sec status up then that becomes useless information local only becomes a real too lif a people actually use it b if they talk to other players to find out what corporations and toons tend to gank in certain areas new players start all the time and some will want to gank and older players can add another alt to the stable so you always need to coordinate with other players to find out who to watch for even then someone will always end up being a gankers first victim and local wont be a help at all
you are missing the context which was the pilot in question being in sov null sechigh sec has little to no value using local as intel unless you are under a war decupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
point to you i will out of context myself from this one then
let players own pocos every where the lower resource amounts in high sec plus the additional cost and resources required to defend them will take care of things let the market work no more ccp price fixingnecessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves  william pitt

im a no1 the more people hanging in stations lounging in stations what have you in stations is less people in space shifting kids in the sandbox from the money maker eve online to big brother eve which has not been as widely or universally well received as im sure ccp would have wanted2 anything that detracts from eve with the current level of development staff is diversity that appears at a glance to be unable to be afforded financially or in focus a few good patches and rebalance is nice relative stability are nice lets have them keep it that wayyou want to walk adopt a dog have some kids find a park
it wont if it will be implemented with integral delaycool down timer like 13 secs between key pressed and actual turning initiated of sort and will rotate ship on some fixed angle 1545 degrees per keystroke each time wasd key pressed it wont be any different from mouse double clicking in terms of bandwith usage but much more convinient it wont be precise also but in most situations you dont need it to be precise you just need to turn your ship slightly
to put it simply  it wont work and eve will never implement itthe game isnt designed to allow this to happensorry but either get used to flying ships as it is at the moment or find another game im not trying to be mean or troll you thats just the way it isjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
actually the controls shouldnt move the ship directly when you use navigation controls it should visually show you a course correction that you then commit to you use the mouse or keyboard to adjust a vector line with a highlighted plane showing deviation from current vector when its set the way you want you click or press a button and off you go same bandwidth usage as current double click but better usabilityi think fps style controls would be a mistake these are spaceships you plot a course and engage
yes it is as ive mentioned before when implemented in right way there wont be any difference in bandwith usage i simply dont understand what others mean under this game isnt designed for such it is really needed and it is not so hard to implement just another method of conveying the same information to server as with doubleclickingi beg to differ combat piloting could be and should be done in that way you wont be always able to plot course in the middle of battle and orders like change course 30 degrees starboard pressing wasd key is perfeclty in place here
rheyne i think most people here are discussing the idea in the op continuous control of ship by moving the mouseif you wish to have feedback on your idea you may be better of starting your own thread
if we really are having a discussion here why what ive wrote wont do for objectionsadditions to model proposed by topic starter
well finally there is an opinion i totally agree with this used to be a place where social relations meant something where ones success heavily depended on the integrity of and cooperation within some ingame community he associated himself with the isboxer shurely makes circumventing social relations part of the game too easy it makes some tasks which otherwise would have required many hours of training and teambuilding like suicide ganking or even doing incursions  yes there are isboxer gangs succeffully doing even high end pve stuff too easy to achieve for just one man who was smart enough to install some software and follow its configuration guide which means effectively anyone who was able to complete games tutorial in the first place even not so smart high schooler can do this yes similar funcionality could be achived with some hardware tools or by running 23 alts in parallel sessions still can be done by one man simply alttabing through different windows but this doesnt mean nothing should be done you know security people tend to say skillfull burglar can pick almost any lock but this doesnt mean we have to stop locking the door when going out you cant achieve total security but you shurely can reduce the number of those who successfully bypass restrictions by making things much more challenging for them and punish them more severe and keeping this number as low as possible is what this all about
is there any reason ccp cannot reference those programs from within eve 99 of pc games do not rely on 3rd party programs so for a new player that is just starting eve the idea of downloading another program to install setup and run seems ludicrous looking online for help thats normal downloading 3rd party software and setting up api access seems like a scam at first and would not even cross most mindsif my tutorial agent for ship fitting told me about a black market tool to help test fittings i would consider downloading itif the tutorial showing me the skill queue said  there are many ways to plan your future check our wwwcom for more information i would look into iteve starts in full screen mode by default alt tabbing is a nightmare to most 3rd party apps feels wrong until you comprehend it
dear csmas you may know the industrial side of eve has been left unattended for a while in every areacan you please use this post to really take note of what people are asking for since ageseven if thus us a small portion of eve please understand that it is a core aspect of the game together with the market and acknowledge that changes are needed the game has evolvedtopics that need to be revisited are various and i know that many pilots have come up with very good threads regarding poses manufacturing management trading analytics mining ships evolutioni will not redo them instead im asking those great pilots to refresh their thoughts here and motivate other carebears to post hereplease listen we are not just a minoritywe are part of everoldsfly smart
some beautiful ideas mining capital ship t3hull class orcaname trex6 mining lasersorca cargo capcitydiff modules configuration pos corp management improvementsadd production slots to each array massivelyadd corpies slot rental ui and member hangars fleet history enhancement for corp mining payoutsthere are several good examples these days that include a fee for each role and mining capabilities of each used ship improved radar pos array gives alerts to pilots when neut or red pilots in system able to configure it with auto warp to pos asteroid mining array posonly to use in sov spaceable to mine roids at 30 km distancesilos abilityno defense capabilities
i would also add that the ice and ore site scanners be limited to mining shipslet the gankers scan it out or train an alt to fly a mining shipship scanners should becombat sites for combat shipsmining sites for mining ships
i think that all sites should require a scandown for both parties like it was before gives some advantages to both sides miners have to take time to find the sites and are thus vulnerable to guys like me looking for you and as long as your dscan is working youll see my combat probes long before im able to pin you down
edit posted draft copy thanks for not taking differing opinion as a personal attack as so many people here do give the ecm a try trust me a ganker cant wait for the jam cycle to finish he has only seconds and if you hit two in a row he will be concorded before he can fire two shots if he is flashy he may not even get one ill mail you ingame tonight to discuss terms of you occupying our belts
its whiners like this that are ruining eve i mined in the beginning never got ganked know why i learned how to tank orbit and use dscanand yes i play in highsec how about you htfu and actually play the game you have all the tools needed to survive and prosper in this gameuse them
you know one real issue here is that a people create small corps just to war dec larger alliances in order to take all members out of incursion running they log in for 1 minute to renew the dec and log out there is a real abuse of war dec mechanics that needs to be addressed with by ccp
seriously this is just a bunch of noob corp only alt characters complaining about the war dec systemlets just lock itjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
so im surprised this hasnt been brought up yet but hey why noti saw that the csm is looking into the recent debacle of tos changes and the every changing attitude and direction of eve to a less risky and more safe style of game if possible could the csm give us updates in this or another thread as they come in specifically id like if possible any updates regarding meetingsdialogue with ccp most importantly id like to know if there is a lack of dialogue or simply regurgitating legal language by ccp to csm requests i think that would be a rather telling sign of things to comealso this isnt a complaint or demand about the csm and saying theyre not doing enough or something just an ideapostthing because clearly this issue isnt going to be dropping anytime soon so why not have a place for it outside gd with more focused purpose outside of trolling gd stylegood idea bad ideaedit if its just me feeling this way feel free to flame away im just testing the waters to get opinions on this beyond the tos problem
this has been going on for several years of csm why would they start now clearly csm have no power to turn eve away from its direction of wow in space even when we managed to get mostly nullsec pilots elected who im sure oppose this direction
i dont know it just seemed to me like a bunch of crap happened one after the other soi made this thread like i said if this is just a phase that happens that 10year vets have seen before let me know ive been here only since 07 so i might not be seeing the trends others are vov
people are beginning to really hear about it and see the effects of itmost of them arent happy1 for what was promised with transparency after incarnaive never run for csm but if our current csm cant push for the values of what eve is within its strong mature even cold playerbase i think its worth a second look as to who is representing usplease push these issuesnine years of staying faithful 2004 player please dont change the spirit of this game and your company now
i too support a call for dialogue i feel this tos is first small stone setting the groundwork toward a direction that could potentially and fundamentally change eve for the worse further i believe that the dialogue on this matter should extend beyond forum posts and should include voicevideo casts and that the player base must receive direct answers not those clouded with ambiguity and legal jargon
also is the csm allowed to update us on this kind of thing live just curioushope not salso also if enough people post in this thread voicing concerns like mine can we get a csm statement or plan to address this a call for ccp to talk to them somethingedit re post above mine same concern here if a video response series happened would the devs be able to actually speak their own mind and such or would a team of lawyers ia and the ea dude be off camera forcing them to spit out canned responses
1 from another upset player the tos changes dont in any way impact my own play style but i am vehemently against anything that limits the sandboxadditionally can the csm let us the very concerned players know if there is anything more proactive we
would love to have the number to internal affairs
i think at this point even just having the csm or ccp give us an update like we will have an official response for you by x date then at least we would know its actually being looked at seriously rather than a if we dont look at it then it cant hurt us type of mentality
i would just like to clarify my post i do hate the fact that this game is slowly being ruined by the need to cater to the casual crowd resent developments have been another big step in that direction for sure however it is not a new phenomenonwar dec nerfs repeatedlyconcord buffsmining barge buffsthe safety weapons locksuicide insurance nerfthe list goes on with very little movement in the opposite direction if the csm had the power to stop any of those past changes im sure they would which must lead us to the conclusion that they do not have the power
i support a call for clarityi support a call for transparencyill go even farther supporting a call to make the tos as clear as wateri can understand some rules having a level of openness but this must be more the exception than the rule quotethe more i know about humans the more i love animalsquote aint that right
simply put stonewalling is damaging to the communitya clarification about the reasons why said changes needs to be made even if the eve community does not agree with them there is so much ambiguity in said terms that they could apply to virtually any groupnobody well at least not many people are suggesting that impersonating a ccp employee gm or isd should be allowed it has always been that waykeeping quiet doesnt fix the problem it never has in eveperhaps it does in other mmos where the playerbase is not as vocal and communication comes down as an absolute law but given the sheer amount of publicity that ccp has gained from certain scams which would now be bannable an explanation if not a complete rewording is neededyour move ccp and keep in mind that no response would most likely mean a lot of alt accounts being unsubbed
my accounts are on a 3month subscription cycle and their renewal is pretty well in doubt at this point
1in the same boat
my alt runs out in six days unless i plex it why should i if i can get banned for saying im me but on that alt
i was going to make 20 new suicide ganking accounts when my new pc is put together but i probably wont do that now
about 2 days ago brave newbies camped their inbound gate into their home system a majority of the fleet was orbiting the gate at 10km and dropping cans every so oftenabout a half hour later a gm cynoed onto the gate and cynoed out moments later all the cans were deleted let us be clearwe were not dropping cans to cause lagwe were dropping cans to decloak covertopsonly about 60 cans were droppedour dear ceo received a warning that his account would be banned if the conduct continued could this rule be clarified its very open ended is there a hard limit on the amount of cans we can drop on a gate to decloak cloakies
dropping cans and probes before odyssey to decloak cloakies is a game exploit which is against the rules 60 cans means pretty much all gate has been coveredof course if gm feels that a particular can droppings at a gate is to decloak it will remove it and give you a warning  ban depending on whats your karma status in game i hope that there is not a particular number of cans allowed as that would lead to again the same thing i think its a matter of your intentions with the dropped cans rather than a specific number if there is 100 cans 100 drones on grid around one gate ranging from 0200km then its probably not someone using the exploit but remains after a fight of course you can use the remains to your own advantage i guess if you catch someone that way you are pretty much safe from gm firepsshame on you
i just double checked the tos and i couldnt find a rule that makes this claim in addition we were told that we broke rule 16
how is burn jita fine and droping cans on a gate not its not about lag its about decloaking cloaky ships if a handful of cans messes up your servers then the problem is your servers if you dont want cans on gate make the gate guns shoot cans dont loose your minds and threten to ban someone who had nothing to do with the can droping what the hell its a legitimate pvp stategy how many bubbles on a gate can i have before i get baned how about drones how many drones can a fleet have out before the corp ceo gets baned avoid asshatteryps enjoy these paying coustomer tears
please listen to your own suggestion
im going to come right out and say i greatly support adding a delay to local or at least something that actually gives hunters a chance to catch the prey its common knowledge that nullsec in a lot of areas at least is more safe than high sec simply because of the local channel and this shouldnt behaving said that a 2 minute delay is kinda insane even 30 seconds is on the long end that essentially means that for people who are good with dscan you can jump in warp and have point before the nullbears even know youre there a 1530 second delay is most likely a better window or tie it in with sov upgrades  it starts at 30 seconds and can get down to 15 seconds with a fully upgraded systemthis would also mean that more ratters and miners would die in nullsec which is how it should be but because of that there should be more incentive to be out there we need to keep in mind the risk vs reward aspect of the game as well the easiest solution to this that i can see is giving bigger bounties on rats in null specifically and shifting more oreice or have more of the rarer stuff out there this is hypothetical ive never mined so that could be way off basethe other benefit of this change is the nerfing of afk cloaking via the buffing of roaming nobody likes it when theres an afk cloaker in system and frankly its much more fun to not have to afk cloak until people get sick of waiting which sometimes is neverin the end a hunter being proficient with dscan should counteract in some small part all the intel channels and insystem support that the prey often has the prey has all the tools and more that the hunter has and this means that somebody who is very very good can catch pvers and on the flip side pveers who are paying attention can still always get out safely
making null crappier to carebear in wont bring about some gankers heaven itll just mean the stubborn holdouts that do bear in null will just move to highsec the rewards are very nearly as good anyway and much more convenient they added a whole new system of no local null called wormholes go see how popular that isanyway tons of miners and ratters die every day in null go ask those gankers how theyre doing it
thats absurd in an npc corp highsec long as you arent blinged out and know how to fit a tank is you can travel afk  bear whenever the fancy takes you with very little risk see how far that gets you in null
they find clueless players screwing upupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
right same as gankers in highsec being gankable any time even in youre doing every right will make bearing in null a whole crapload less attractive without major buffs that will never happen it wouldnt be worth the risk at all
what makes you think you can catch someone in null who neither consents to the encounter nor makes a serious errorcan you stop them from hitting warp if they were aligned to a pos or outpostno they either screw up and ignore you or they wanted to meet youas to suggesting you can make them undock in a slow to align ship that is the same as saying you can make them screw upi want your mind powers in that caseupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
i never suggested any of that i agree they need to screw up or be pretty unlucky scrambled by rats for instance
i agree with you herethat being said it is more fun playing against other players in a more direct senseat least i believe this to be truei would much prefer having to earn my own intel and having those who would hunt me needing to meet this same requirementi could have many more options to counter them rather than simply flee or fighthiding for example misdirection for anotherupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
scanning has gotten too easymy thoughtsleave highsec aloneiincrease the loot amount for lowsec add a scan array module upgradeable module ihub for null sec to increase the amount of sites
lol
you have posted three times in this thread without once being constructive you dont want more ways to fight in high sec more fighting or perhaps you are just a disinterested in the subject and randomly posting you must have a mind i promise no nasty men will break into your house if join in with the discussion in a reasonable way if your opinion what ever it might be is valid then why is that what is it etc can you not persuade others that it is a good pov if so why
are we talking to ccp about the tosof course we arecan i tell you what we are saying and what is being said back to usof course not any discussions in our backroom channels are ndad to death but if you look to the active threads you will see that people like mynnna and ali are strongly involved in the discussion trying to find a common ground talking and listening to you do you think that is only on the public sidegive us time between the time differential and the fact that we are going into a weekend give us time i am not saying drop the subject if it is something you feel passionate about let us know what you think just dont expect instantaneous response timemmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
this pops up every so oftendropping cans to decloak people is allowed to a point the general consensus is that there is no problem until you might cause lag with the sheer amount of cans on grid see it as a common sense thing 20 or so cans would be okay 60 would most likely be a probleminterestingly the same policy also applies to anchorable warp disruptor bubblesbtw the rules have never been clear or precise on purpose because what causes or does not cause lag varies from situation to situation depending on general server health and populationedit as far as the comparison between burn jita and spamming causing lag goes one is players doing their thing the other is player generated trash
well i plan on pushing the rule as far as we can go before i break tos there has to be a line in the sand somewhere saying x amount of cans trash is too muchwill we be banned if we drop 59 canswell in this case we were camping inside barleguet this system is easily one of the most active systems in the game it almost always shows up as a giant red blob when filtering the star map for ships destroyed in the past 24 hours number of pilots docked and active etc
i read the mail on reddit and i hope to hell that the gm isnt implying that the ceo is going to have actions taken against his account for something that other people doi dont care about what was done to cause grief banning someone for the actions of others is not on
i am spartacus
like i said there is no hard or fast rule about it its a judgement call at the gms discretion because there will be times where 10 cans will create detectable amounts of lag and there will be other times where 100 wontagain the general consensus among many in quite a few threads is that you should use a bit of common sense you dont need to go overkill right away when you can pull off largely the same results with lessim trying to see if i can find the gm post that i distinctly recall that explains this but i seem to have trouble finding itfake editthis actually happens more often than you think goonswarm leaders and their pets were sometimes evemailed over certain station names they had no knowledge of andor actions of underlings when no one perp could be singled outsee it as a get your house in order type warning and not as a direct threat against the ceo
oh your objections are fine but what your suggesting is not an addition to the model its a totally different modeli was merely pointing out that people commenting about the bandwith useage and that game is not designed for such control are writing about the idea in the op and not about your idea about the hotkeys
problemits very difficult for small corps and alliances to establish a foot hold in null security null space is vast but very underused null sec should be used for fighting for and keeping space not renting space you dont need to otherspossible solution sov assets do not send a message to the alliance they are under attack or damaged they show up on screen with hp listed  territorial control unit 100 or pos shield 30 in red if damaged edit originally proposed changing timers to 48 hours but decided to leave them as they are edited out they still reinforce but for 48 hours instead of 24 they need to be repped back uphow does this solve the problemif assets did not send a message removing the need for players to actually notice that they are under attack then a small alliance could come into a region that has been tcud but not occupied by the alliance and kill them if they wanted to remain anonymous as in not showing up on the map as occupying the system then they could simply not deploy their own tcu if a person has a pos then they should be logging in every day or every other day to check on it relying on the server to police other players actions leads to invulnerability to the larger alliances and requires no work to be done one can simply wait for an automated email from the serverwith this change a small corp or alliance could go into the very underused parts of null sec all of which are claimed and destroy that old moon holding pos that no one uses set up their own build their strength make allies with other like minded corps alliances and perhaps become powerful enough to challenge the existing monolithic and stagnant null sec alliances that arent using that space at all
but thats just it  its not a crimethink of it as doing the dishes to pay for your meal 
all that happened with this scam is a guy did his homework and made everyone look like an idiot in the process with precision and guile he undermined ccps dependence on chribba darkness grendel and rene delabou to preform a function they were just to lazy to code into the game cant say im all to impressed with isds performace of managing evelopdia either its analogous to the fat lazy tsa security agent asleep on the job and lets a gun or drugs get onto a plane so yes if you literally cant log onto a wiki and check the edit history and have enough common sense to know something isnt right then no one should trust you its not like evelopedia is kept up to date or accurate to begin with as evidenced by the fact many player organizations keep their own wikis as a source of real knowledge on the gamei can understand feeling duped or even embarrassed at having one guy work over an entire paid company and its volunteers to run riot in a environment of increasing complacency and incompetence what i refuse to understand because it requires accepting a few fallacies is retro actively punishing someone to cover up said complacency and incompetence the person stupid enough to fall for a glorified shell game shouldnt be rewarded with gm intervention let the fool pay for his foolishness let the clever man profit
ccp is trying hard to remove any discernible lines in the sand to avoid exactly that behaviorthis has been a common theme across very different fields of gm decisions over the past years  be it how the eula applies to 3rd party software where exactly is the line between an allowed keyboard macro and a bot the protection of new players what does ccp mean when talking about rookies cache reading its against the eula but we wont enforce the eula in this case  unless you use the cache reader to automate gameplay then we will enforce the reverseengineering clause in the eula to the new impersonation policies to use an example a rookie generally is a player within his 30 days of eve  unless you get the idea that baiting 31 or 32 day old players is ok its about following the spirit of the tos rather than about looking for loopholes in its letter looking for loopholes is a good way to get gms to punish youccp has been fighting the extension of the harsh  ruthless nature of the ingame universe into the metagame for some time now it really shouldnt come as a surprise
i mostly agree with thisim huge fan of finding loopholes and playing with the grey area with regards to rules because it wouldnt be eve without doing such things and i must admit im a little leery of the new tos rules regarding impersonation i feel there needs to be some serious clarification on the matterhowever pushing things to the utter limit is actually how we get more and harder restrictions placed upon us and hard restrictions become dicey when you are dealing with dynamic issues such as server performancelet me put it another wayimagine yourself as a gm your job is to ensure a stable server and prevent player abuse without infringing too much on emergent gameplayyou get a petition from a player that a group is spamming cans all over a gate you know that enough debris over a concentrated area will cause lag for some people but you also know that can spam is a perfectly legitimate form of gameplay which would you be more inclined to ignorewriteoff  the group launching only 10 or 20 cans and isnt making more unless the old ones disappearor the group that has made 60 cans and seems to be making more as time goes on
no we dont all love it for the most part its bad for both sides of the equationfor the blobbed you have 1 no chance 2 your fitting skills real life skills and ship invalidated by raw dps 3 no fun at allfor the blobbed you have 1 no risk 2 your fitting skills real life skills and ship invalidated by raw dps 3 its boring and completely unchallengingsolo  small gang pvp needs to be improved drasticallyi posted this in another thread but ill repeat it here yesterday i fitted up a t2 fitted blaster mega my intention was to get it exploded in rancer as i had noticed a t3 legion t2 oneiros and t1 drake on a gate flashy red it was a suicide mission but might still be fun i jump into rancer locked  scrammed the legion the drake n logi docked legion jumped into next system and docked 3 v 1 they refused to engage this morning i undocked in same mega jumped from rancer to creleire or whatever its called same guy that was in legion was camping in a harbinger with a logi i lock up the harb start shooting him not long i have about 10 pandemic legion dropped on mei dont care about the ship but i do care about the game and its currently pure shite when 3 vs 1 run from the 1 because of risk aversion and even 2 vs one they need to be able to drop 10 other ships on you before theyll engage in a fightedit actually i just noticed the pl guys helped kill the guy in the harb so i guess they were just roaming in a girlie blob and ran into us already engaged
we recently got a new recruit in our corp who has returned to the game postodyssey to see how exploration has improvedhe recently emailed me and stated that his main way of making money is no longer viable we of course gave him all kinds of tips about running combat sites  but still he even is considering unsubbing from the game because the way he liked to make isk is no longer viablei will offer yet another possible solutionyou make all sites harder to scan down but introduce 3 new scanning skill books for each type of site something like combat signature triangulation data signature triangulation and relic signature triangulationthe more you have your specialty triangulation skill trained up the easier it is to find that type of site we have a real problem here with exploration in eve now the odyssey buzz lasted for maybe 6 weeks at best and its now expired leaving exploration a diminishing eve profession
its true i am contemplating just unsubbing the problem is that i feel pigeonholed into doing combat sites in a game that emphasizes player freedom and choice this is a death sentence i was loving exploration before  i built up my scanning skills and worked towards an arbi that could scan down and clear radarmag sites in mostly lowsec i am just not willing to risk lowsec now because the payoff is questionable at best the minigame is something i can get used to and i even like the idea of adding some challenge to the sites themselves although the minigame feels highly dependant on pure luck  the loot pinata mechanic is justa strange choice i just dont understand what that is about oh no they got past our firewalls explode all loot now it feels like that build i was using is just worthless and the scanning skills i built up are inconsequential i am a new player i dont have any brilliant ideas for making exploration better like those helpful players above me but i can offer up my feelings on the state of exploration in the hopes that it can be improvedwithey
if it had been implemented properly with real content that tied into the game in space and with a graphics engine that didnt potentially slow cook graphics cards it might have worked as it is now the best thing that could happen is its removal asap because all it does is remind us of what could have been a really interesting addition to the game
get a graphics card that isnt an embarrassment to pc gamers everywhere and it works great with a three year old budget card you can run everything in incarna on top settingsit needs to be added to not removed
only to use in sov space thank you for that i thought this was going to be another give me a ship no one can gank in hisec so i can afk mine i thought there were a few industrial caps in game that did some of this already
reading it you start off whining than you went constructive but as ganking has been nerfed hard most gankers will read even that as whining clearly there are issues when i high sec gate camp near dodi can pop any ship they want mostly industrials simply because they want to nope that is called risk hisec is not safe if it is pushed down that road of being a nonpvp zone than i suggest all rocksice be moved to low or null otherwise the market will become trash if you are running around with a expensive load of materials 10m or 1b they will target you i will target you and you are doing it wrong
ok you want my opinionwhen you break down the ops suggestion it amounts to putting some rules in place that an aggressor has to follow or the wardec that they are paying for becomes invalid his justification is that in real life if a soldier does not fight he will be punished for being awolhowever he fails to suggest how the defender in the war will be punished should they not fightmy thoughts are that his main is in a corp that was decked they stopped playing and hid in stations but the person who decked them did not show up all week despite nobody showing up to fight he still hid in the station and tried to come up with a change to the game to make things easier for him and his current situationhe also created an alt just to post this idea rather than putting the one or two characters that decked him into contacts and monitoring them while going about his businessjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
you may lack experience of high sec wars as you seem unaware of a tactic that is familiar to me it is a no brainer a lot of the time that the wt will have alts watching ive been in a war where the aggressor had more alts than corp members  a side effect of a desire for a perfect killboard i assume half the point is to lull you into going about your business under the watch of the alts then as if a shock on log the wts essentially it isnt worth the risk of going about your normal business but there will be no wts to shoot unless you undock something shiny or at least easy to kill that is not to say that you cant use that to make a trap but that is usually tedious certainly a long way from being a rewarding use of time you can not be watched 237 but without prior knowledge and tedious research you can not be certain who is watching you or have them all on your watch list you dont know who the enemy is there are more interesting things to do in this world than mess about not fighting a war in eve fighting and winning is also a huge risk especially if you dont want to be in a war as the aggressor can not call in allies you get fresh war decs instead turning seven days of something you dont want into ten plus days is not smartthe aggressor in a war has the purpose of shutting the corp down that or surrender are the conditions that end wars early perhaps there should be some penalty if the aggressor does not achieve that aimas a defence docking up is the best totally effective it would seem odd to penalise the defender for using a defensive tactic that is 100 effective i cant think what else the defender should achieve in war than a 100 effective defence and still be operating after seven days  surely fulfilling that role so effectively should earn a reward rather than a penalty more so when the defender has assets in space that are totally ignored a lot of problems do seem to relate to the use of these roles as they create expectations that are unrealistici do agree that there is currently absolutely no point in a defender fighting a war and that might lead to suggesting some form of carrot via penalty for the defender but all such ideas tend to be impractical because you can not force players to log in that does logically lead to considering the aggressor if the defender fighting could in some hurt or hinder the aggressor in a meaningful way then that could perhaps help persuade the defender to fight however as you demonstrated there is a great deal of hostility towards such an approachcurrently it is fairly pointless for either side to do anything unless they are certain it kills them more isk than they can lose  that tends to lead to stalemate at best using an alt to post an opinion about anything on these forums is reasonable especially where a war dec may effect more that just four corp members where at least three are one persons alts i dont think it is fair to risk a week of all my corps mates playtime by joining in with the forum with my main so i use an alt i pay a subscription like everyone else and feel i have a right to express an opinion as an account holder rather than a character the idea that we must get caught up in roleplay when discussing game mechanics is daft but can be the case
so would you have been fine with it if ccp had simply said bravo you got us that time congratulations to you but anyone who does this in the future will cop a ban and had worded the tos change accordinglymy personal opinion is that because it involved evelopedia which after all is a ccp administered site through the isd they want to make it crystal clear that mucking about with ccp stuff in the cause of scamming is definetely out of order doesnt change the fact the communication has been pretty crappy but im willing to let the csm work that out because thats one of the things we elected them to do
the correct and mature response would have been for ccp to allow the scam to stand announce that the tos needed to be reworked if this is really that big a deal and carried on the new wording of the tos leaves something to be desired and i am sure the csm and ccp are working on that in joint effort to reach a satisfactory conclusion one of the things this highlights and i think is important is the implicit endorsement of certain players who engage in facilitating 3rd party transactions in ccps own reasoning the wiki and the articles therein give the appearance of an endorsement by ccp so having pages for players like chribba is a de facto endorsement by ccp of one player over others who might be involved n 3rd party transactions lets say someone wants to be the next chribba how much harder will it be for them to break into the 3rd party market some player will sayi wonder who i should use for a 3rd party oh look evelopedia says i should use chribba since it lists him as a trusted third partyif i am wrong why is it the only people that get requested to do third party transactions are the ones that just happened to be listed in evelopedia im no industrialist by any means but i think its crap that a monopoly is held by certain people over certain transactions in the game
this so many times thisalso if the receiving warehouselanding pad is full perhaps the production facility pauses production
ocan we please see when we will receive our next neural remap availability bonus remap point currently the system doesnt tell you when you still got 1 or more left when the next extra bonus remap point will beso for example if you currently have one bonus remap and want to plan ahead for example capital ships you cant plan that well because you have no idea when you will get the 2nd bonus remap after the 1st bonus remap pointits hard to save 2 or more neural remap points this waybecause if you use a remap point for example a month before you get the next onethe timer no doubt resets to another full year waiting and there is no way knowingwith the current system if you should have waited that month or not
bonus remaps come from special circumstances such as when learning skills got removed or for christmas gifts from the devs you dont need a timer to tell when youre going to get a new bonus becausewellyoure probably notedit you got bonus remaps for new characters same rules applyweeeekeeee 
you cant naturally accumulate remaps even if you dont spend a remap for a whole year you can never have more than one unless ccp has a special eventgift that gives you the extra
bump
i definitely would like to see something like this even if not this exact idea come to be the expansion to the industryhauler game would be gamechangingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
to the tophrolt ceo live free die proud
1 op sums it up and has the cpupgrate id like to seewhat all the muh stations people are forgetting is that a pos costs 110440mmonth to fuel so stations are still better even with 100 refine on posesnow where the hell is this pos patch weve be
while constant shipmodule rebalances are great and all and the revamp to exploration makes it a significantly more viable career i would like to draw attention to a careerui that has been overlooked for some timecorporation management as frivolous as that may sound the current user interface for managing permissions is not only unclean and disorganized but also inflexible and incredibly limited to clarify here are some problems my corporation has an infrastructure wherein we purchase goods from our members based off of a  of the tool tip value that has been researchedtested to be extremely close to average market price we do this through the usage of contracts which can be viewedaccepted from anywhere in new eden and beyond which allows a fast transfer of goods internally however because anyone in the corp can accept a contract assigned to the corporation for themselves and the contract manager permission just allows people to pay for contracts with corp money rather than deciding who can accept things on behalf of the corp as it should we currently have to have people assign the contracts to individual officers based on their location in reference to that officers home base which means the time frame of it being accepted is based on that individual members real life schedule and since many of us have to log into real life from time to time this could mean a delay of up to a couple days which is far from satisfactory the lack of a total tooltip for contracts is infuriating while such a tooltip would be visible on a container it is not on the contracts themselves which complicates the kinds of things we can move in this manner and how we have to move them there is no way to make a character based at a pos which means in order to give permissions at a pos i have to give permissions to the member under the at other basis which means he gains those permissions at all facilitiesother than hq there is no way to let people simply view the balance of a wallet without letting them take from it accountant just allows you to pay bills most of which can be set up as auto pay while jr accountant just allows you to view said bills accountant for some reason also allows people to buy and sell things for the corp which is what the trader role does when a character has wallet access he immediately gains the ability to withdraw to his personal account which invalidates permissions such as rent factory trader and contract manager which allows them to use the corp wallet for certain things they could instead just withdraw to their personal and do it anyways there is no way to tax anything other than missions this is bull because npc corps can tax you a portion of your minerals from refining and the like running a corp is free if you own no offices which leads to people making 1 man corps just to dodge npc tax rates this needs to be addressed as it is practically an exploit and encourages the formation of way too many corporations i mean alliances are not free why should a corp be make a startup fee and perhaps a maintenance fee based on size might do it while this may not be a popular idea to most it is something that should be done there are too many bs corps that do nothing but dodge taxes please read post 16 for full explanation point is the permissions in general are unorganized bulky and overlap one another to a major degree while some may argue that a change to this structure would only ever be seen directly by about 5 of players those that assign permissions it would affect 90 of players that are not in an npc corp with the others being in single leader corpsalliances or 1 man fake corps while everyone loves seeing the dominix get rebalanced and then 3 months later have the rebalance reversed there are other things that need to be focused on honestly scanning was a very limited profession in fact it used to be classified as a miniprofession i am glad ccp revamped this now it is a viable and obvious thing corporation management isnt that far behind in terms of number of people that would benefit from it being overhauled seriously if we add a moderate fee to create a corporation add a small numbers based fee to maintain a corporation making them akin to current day alliances and revamp the permissions so they actually work it would lessen the number of corps in existence greatly as people would consolidate more corporations like red frogblack frogblue frog in terms of recognizably would come into existence and we would reach a point where a corp is actually a corp rather than a corp being a social clan eve is economy based it needs this the changes above are a must and they need to be implemented soon however if ccp would like to go the route of a full fledged expansion just one for business it would be appreciated perhaps add more contract options like peace treaties or allow corps to rent out their manufacturing facilities to the public hell something that would be an amazing work of art would be to allow corps to become publicly traded once they hit a certain number of players and allow the corp to sell shares on the market i could see test and goonswarm becoming popular stocks in eve a structure that would autodeduct isk from a corp wallet to pay a dividend and having said dividend listed in that stock market would allow players to supplement their income by investing in various corporations the point here is that white collar work is still work and deserves just as much attention as exploration which prior to odyssey was barely used hell this could be when you would finally enable the promised harvesting array iis  even if we dont elect for a full expansion a simple patch to fix most of what is outlined would be great
thanks for your posti hate afk mining tbh i really like to encourage ppl to fight for their own spaceand we dont have an advantage vs high sec mining fuel costs dont even let you bring minerals from null and sell in hs at a profitable priceindustry needs a revamp
yep in a nutshell that i the problem with wars in high secaltsor alternate accounts is a very good way to keep eyes out for the enemyi use them myself but in my case my pvp toons are my altsi use them only for projecting a political statementpower whether that is a gank or dec but there are other means as wellusing your friends that the enemy does not know aboutomg neutral repperspvp toons what a conceptget used to it and quit your bellyachingnow as i understand itppl can offer to assist others in their defense and join the warbut not an aggressorhmm i think thats need to changefor one there is abuse to aggress someone and then have an alt corp offer assistance for a sum of iskcorps that wish to should be able to join either side if warranted applicable by either defender or aggressorand if someone joins the war on the side of which ever the increased pay should be immediately taken from the sides walletif the war is basically concluded in a clear cut victor defender sideaggressor side then assisting corps get that cash paid to their corps wallet makes an incentive for ppl to enter a wardec already in place might cut down on wardec scams and gives those trying to start or maintain a small merc corp the ability to make or increase a reputation for themselvesside note shadow alliancesif ppl are in a fleet together but in an alliance but different corpsthere should be ways to agress the entire fleet not wait till someone assists in a battle to be able to shoot themnew suspect system i think may help the majority of such issuesneed more thought on this just saying tho
for those of you wondering why i wrote that we are an alliance of about 150 people we have been at war for just over a month and a half there is rarely nobody online in my alliance and we certainly dont stay docked up the aggressing corp is a 2 man corp that has been seen online for maybe 10 minutes collectively for the entire war it just seems like abuse of the war dec system to me but it is within the rules and those of you trolls i will not post my alliance or corporation im not new to eve and i dont want more war declarations
oh look another 150 man alliance that is scared of 2 people that barely log in
how do people who are logged out stop anyone doing anythingi mean afk cloaker whines are bad enough but complaining about people who arent even logged in come on now
so if it has no effect on you wheres the abuse
to put it simply its keeping a few of us from incursions i know a lot of people dont care for them but they are part of the game and its what we pay to do i would be fine with a month and a half war with people who actually come online for more than a minute a week but that is not the case and there is no way to get back at them
as already covered the alt watches for the juicy target the aggressor has no need to put themselves in any danger there is no reason to ban alts but you would have to be utterly naive to not understand the role they play the defender is only ever a target of opportunity under the current system not really a combatant there is no opportunity to take the fight to the aggressor and nothing the defender does will achieve anything worthwhile such as ending the war early or destroying meaningful assets using a game mechanic to put the equivalent of 375 subscriptions into a game mode that is essentially unplayable or at least restricted for the entertainment of half a subscription doesnt really fit into abuse exceptionally high on the crap design front though war is supposed to entail armed conflict i think it is the definition of war  we do have plenty of arms but a distinct lack of anything to shoot at  unless you set sail in a mining barge but that is a bit of a moot point if 152 people are involved by the system then the system should provide them something to do war should be a positive event and not a reason to groanthe current system pretty much serves to prevent combat if 150 people could wipe out a two man corp in a matter of seconds as logic says they should be able to do using rookie ships and by throwing rocks then there would be some sense to it at least but such an obvious complete rapid and inevitable victory is far beyond what the war system is capable of providing it is impractical to go about your business as normal during war that should be the case and shouldnt change but since your normal gameplay has been interrupted an alternative must be provided and it should be up to the aggressor to provide it 237  anchored assets seem practical in achieving that
it sounds like the action ccp should have taken would have been to delete the evelopedia it would elimanate any appearance of ccp endorsing players plus it would have the side benefit of getting players to find better sources of information than something pretending to be a wikito see what i mean by it only pretending to be a wiki go to any ship page click edit note that the stat block for the ship is not editable if evelopedia was truly a wiki then everything would be editable but since its not it cant be a wiki
solosmall gang pvp needs to be improved by you in your mind it is what you make of itif people dont want to engage you then you cant do much to change that thats what the sandbox is all about if they dont want to take a change to loose a ship then why engage i understand its frustrating if people have a fleet and you take the bait then you will probably die if your megathron got caught on a belt by a pilgrim falcon and a rapier and died slowly would you be angry then if yes why it was only 1v3 only that the game mechanics ensured that they will be safe no matter what ship you bring against themnobody enjoys when they die every loss gives us a particular information about a corpalliancesystemtactics and more information like this make you a better pvp playerif you think it needs to be improved because you dont kill anything and die all the time then you must be doing something wrong and change things there is countless hours of evidence in form of pvp videos on youtube or evefiles that solo its still possible alive and bubbling with life a lot of time these videos dont show you times when you get blobbed to hell i dont put these fights in my videos either which happens a lotsolo small gang was is and i hope will remain extremely hard purely because of blobbing and people wanting an easy kill and not a good fight dont expect people to give you kills for free it happens but not often purely for this reason i want to solo i would never want it to be easy because id loose the amazing feeling of victory against the odds if you knew you can win or loose fights at the start of the fight eve would loose one of the important things why i play the game and thats the adrenaline rush and not knowing whats comingstop putting goddamn templates to something which is already perfect just because you are unlucky or dont have enough experience to find a good fight im getting quite annoyed with thisedit your avatar is sexy
there might be other ways to go about finding engagements for solo pilots but nothing wrong with your approach sandbox etc 07m8m8
if you agree please post a comment saying so this is easyan eve legal system  court of appealsfrom this so i propose a venue for people to talk about petitions and responses a wiki of easytofollow albeit extensive rules and incidents of precedent so we stop having these same problems with people getting banned because they couldnt find the rule perhaps even a csm appointed court of appeals edit court of appeals a bad idea it solves a lot of problems imho and would be kind of cool
yes to some codification of clear yesno cases that have been brought to the gmsno to a court of appeals
maybe youre right you probably are in fact so no appeals court i still think it would be a good idea to explicitly outline all the rules and allow capsuleers to edit the wiki to include a multitude of scenarios so as to remove any doubt about the rules
there are different levels of risk that go along with the different areas that pocos are in high sec has the lowest risk possible and thus has the lowest possible returns low sec has slightly more risk to it and you can make more isk out in low sec and null sec and wh space offer the best planets and as such you get the best isk out of them if you want to make more isk which is what is sounds like you are wanting then you should go to the low sec or null sec wh space and take the risk to make the isk high sec is the place that isk is made in eve if you want it you have to go get itdrunk bastard
so are we geting any more form this or any one know any thing

read the first 56 replies got boring i agree with poster should be able to reset skill pointsi also agree with everyone against it for old chars its way imba and would ruine the game thus why not offer new players a chance to have a 1 time skill reset that expires after say 1 yearive put points into gunnery shield etc when im an armor tank before i learned about different tank styles and weaponry i kind of just put all of a mish mash into everything its usefull if i used itbut never will now i know the game it would be nice to specialise more towards my hearts content now that i atleast know which direction to go
okay middle ground yearly opportunity to shift a tobedetermined number or skill points from 1 skill to anotherthis is remove from skills and add that to skills with a capacity on the number of movable pointsim thinking 25000 to 50000 per year no more if johnny plays the same toon for 5 years he could move x per year thats 5 times xif that were 25000 per year in five years he could move the points from mining on a pvp toon to something else and then shift some other around to fit his model want to move them back got to wait sorry no gm request for the adjustment you reap what you sow until the next yearno it would not stack year on year whatever the value it would be always have its yearly amount no more use it or lose itbut no sorry not allow him to totally revamp the whole toon every year that would be a nightmareeveryone wins new and old allow the flexibility that experience and commitment to a toon should enable without super charging no one gets super powersi see no reason to deny people the right to remove a skill if they choose to lose the skill points if they just want a cleaner characterskill tree some folks are that way
i have a simple suggestion that i think would drastically reduce hot drops and restore the cyno to what i assume was its original purpose a method of fast travel and strategic placement of forces not as an active combat tacticcreate a new aggression flag any ship lighting a cyno or jumping thru a cyno or any form of bridge titan and covert can not target anything for 1 minute or simply add this to the normal 1 min aggression timer that prevents gate jumpingif the cyno ship has something locked it should break their target locks much like entering siege mode on a dreadnaught and they should get the timer as wellthis should be a very simple thing to add and not require much dev time as the mechanisms for this is already in the gamethis change does not nerf anything it simply would be too risky for people to drop directly on top of someone as they would be sitting ducks for 1 minute instead they can still drop into a system but it would have to be done at a safe spot and then the entire fleet warp into the battleyes i realize this would not completely eliminate hot drops it could still be done but would require 2 ships instead of 1 a cyno ship and a tackle ship and at least the victims have a chance to kill or jam out the tackle ship and get away during the 1 minute timerit sure would be nice to go back to the days of normal roaming fleets instead of suddenly getting 50 guys dropped on your head out of no where from many light years away with absolutely no possible defense or escapewhile your at it it would not hurt to make the cyno jammer mod for the poss also block covert cynos as it is now its an insane cost added to sov bills and is almost worthless as people can still drop in a 100 man sb fleet and kill a cyno jammer in 5 minutes or lessthanks

my newb 2 cents was looking to buy isk and found this thread instead and am now going to buy plex to sellwhy buy isk  i was going to buy isk because the whole benefit of eve online for me is i can level while busy at work and such dont have the time to grind it out i wanted to get enough to buy some implants so that im utilizing all that downtime appropriatly so i can catch up and just jump right in i understand ops view but isk buying will happen because people like myself have money not time this makes me feel less like a criminal and more like im furthering the game as a whole one by paying ccp and two by giving the real dedicated players free play for their hard work
a hulk is a death trap you have a choice move to certain regions in amarr space that seem to be pretty gank free or mine in a skiff or at least a tanked mackinaw if you use an orca please use a bulkhead dcu ii in the lows and shield modules in the mids the thing is that you can still be ganked even in a skiff but they have to work for it and that is ok in my bookedit the thing is that the 10 security status should have repercussions perhaps inability to use fitting services that seems logical anything more is likely to be game breaking for this blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp

i couldnt agree more however with the reaction from ccp being one of sheer knee jerk it almost in some elements breaks the very sandbox they claim to promote scamming has always been a grey area merely because its a core element of the risk new eden gives playersthat risk and subsequent consequence is indeed the one quality that puts eve a cut above other mmos and id implore ccp to remember this risk vs reward does my fleet engage the other do i take that chance jumping into low sec do i really risk my hard earned isk for a super simply because someones name is reputable it all comes down to greed in the case of the scam here
while i personaly have my problems with eves culture of scamming in this case i have to say that ccp is reacting very badly and inmaturethe guy who caused the tos change should get a medal if not a monument in every rookie system for beating the systemfor me ccps reaction does let them look like they are simply butthurt because someone showed the flaws of their system also i lost any trust into ccps ability to have a neutral point of view on any ingame activity because anything i do now might not find ccps aproval and than i end up on the receving end which basicly is what happened to this guythe new tos and the explanation provided especially by gm karidor are no small change or clarification they turn the world of new eden upside downwhile i do not like all of eves curent mechanics  i think the punishment for suicide ganks should be more severe for example i do not wish eve turned into a hello kitty online theme parkif someone upsets me i want to be able to kick him where it hurts even if it costs me and if someone is stupid why should i not profit from itwhat i would have liked to see coming out of this is simply more ways to do honest buisness ie a system where 3rd parties are no longer needed and a evolution on certain flawed game mechanicsbut as always when things should be carefully considered ccp just nukes everything from orbit and calls the problem solved while failing to realize why and how things went wrong

well if its left to ccp staff to do on its own i just dont see anything like this getting done at all maybe the csm could appoint some volunteer players to get the ball rolling and post a first edition then each entry could be argued in the forums in normal fashion and adjustmentsclarifications could be made thereafter
sowhat your asking is to make the deployment of capitals for any purpose other than structures to be pointless the fleet who deploys their capital fleet first on field gets a massive advantage over the second to arrive who has to wait out 60 seconds of being cynofalconed good luck ever disloging a sovholder when the aggressor is going to welp caps without firing a shotblackops ships are the most fragile bs hulls in the game their best use is in deploying cloakable fragile ships into combat and fast ganking enemy ships and gtfo because if they get caught they die your change would deny them the only real thing they have going for themand finally here is the obligatory doll please point to the location the hotdrop touched you

besides the fact that ccp probably are the singly best mmo company at catching rmt transactions and hitting your account with a ban andor suddenly withdrawing all your purchased isk leaving you with a negative wallet buying isk from 3rd party vendors with plex as a viable and legal alternative would be a special brand of stupid

seriously nikk do you actually play eve to do player vs player or just spend all your time championing an unpopular idea and doing forum pvp with anyone who happens to actually play the game and disagree with youhow many years have you been asking for local to be removed on the forums and how many more years before you give up and realize that local is never going to be removed becausea its been in the game unchanged since day oneb ccp have already made space without local intel that being wspacec removing or nerfing local intel in any way would reduce the player base of eve a commercially stupid ideastop trolling and actually play the game you never know you might actually make some friends that way
a do some research local never reported your standings on day one so you had to stop and right click on a name to learn if they were a threat not a lot of effort but better than it being done for youb if you are implying the significant difference between wormholes and regular space is only local you havent been in onec wow you are either psychic or pulling fake claims on us please explain why making intel effort based and forcing the hostiles to make an effort suddenly makes my life harder hint i am a miner it makes my life easierstop the personal attacks they dishonor youupgrading local to eliminate all afk influence what if local chat changed hunting the cloaked
i question why local works the way it does in highsec particularly i dont think it provides any significant benefit to have your name show up instantly it makes things like wardecs hard to perform because the enemy knows when youre in system removing the intel part of local would make some fairly sweeping changes to the game but i extremely doubt that any mechanic was derived from its function
there are prominently placed news feeds with yearsold headlines and dead links the eve gate front page
the tos offer us an opportunity to discuss how we optimally want ccp to handle such clever hacks of the system in the future pool the ideas in this thread pleasenow for the tos situation and how it should have developed clever scam involving messing with ccp info ressources triggers the following responses ccp publishes the exploit in a big story with playerscammer interviews etc  thats positive publicity if the method is problematic then the transfer has to be undone all parties get a pat on the back in the form of a limited hauler full with quafe and dancers for finding the exploitfalling victim as a proof of concept the exploit is fixed in rl wiki editing tools  proofed stable vs latest versions for example and ingame through game mechanics as a last step tos etc are changed to reflect the new situation now in general terms this can be broken down to some steps that should be done to manage those situations in the future i feel like public relations for game designers 101 its not if but when exploits and hacks can always be found so accept it a 1000 eyes publicity and proofofconcept attacks help the game as a whole so publish the stuff to have a part in shaping it no hard feelings allowed cleverness is good reward people who make hacks public  are part victim of a proof of concept together both are part of the hack and should get some kind of ingame reward insert hauler full with quafe and dancers get input now is the time to harness the power of the mad eve crowd to fix it separate approaches to rl  ingame hacks everything that plays out in the sandbox is game content yes burn jita too then call a lawyer and let him translate what you decided into legal secret speech party hard and listen to htfu by the great ccp band p and please please never support people using outofgame means to get back after they dont like specific game mechanics and how other players use them against them
i agree that this latest episode was a pr disaster and demonstrated some blatant failures of internal processes within ccp more that that it seemed like a reversion to the preincarna attitudes that literally almost killed the game and the company with itthat said id rather wait until the tos issue is resolved on its own then it should be time to hammer ccp about making some internal reviews so something like this is far less likely to occur again
i support this entirely provided that npc criminals get to pod people above a certain sec status
i liked malcanis suggestion that concord start to charge for their services we could have them levy a fee of 80 the value of the ship they destroyed divided amongst anyone aggressed by that ship please note i am aware of the obvious implications of this its just satire designed to showcase the absurdity of people making proposals that are fact direct and brutally obvious buffs to their own playstylenumber of times my posts have come in after the devmod locked the thread 1
i agree that finished skill trainings should never be reset but i would not mind if there was 1 per year reset of unfinished trainings for example i started training lvl5 of some asslong skill spent 2 days training it and then decided i dont need it and will never need it and it is forever locked at those 1020 progress it does not happen often but this does happens and it would not grant anyone any significant amount of sp maybe a half million total from all unfinished skills over the year but its no big of an issue in long run

dont forget that you have to establish sbus before you can attack a tcumost systems are ihubed so you cannot immediately attack the tcu but have to work your way through timers also it is already not uncommon for alliances to sbu their own systems these sbus have to be shot down which generates a killmail and a notification to the owner of the sbu before you have even anchored your own sbus in their placeim not convinced your idea solves anything yetyou already can put up a pos and live in someone elses system if the owner isnt home
those are all valid points personally i still cant fathom the stupidity behind letting neg10 players actually get into highsec systems shouldnt a criminal be stopped at shot at the gate oh wait concord and local police dont shoot pods so i guess after i murder and mutilate several members of parliment walking around naked will make me invisible to the local police force
i was told that at some point would be developed by ccp i would like to ask the csm what is the status of  are important to me for a number of reasons most importantly i have decided that the inability for people in game to check linked accounts breaks the game so from my point of view if ccp no longer has the intent to do this then certain gameplay is closed to me and my continued playing of eve is unlikely please can someone serious respond to this and not the normal mouthy trollsedit below in a number of posts which are below some troll posts i explain my reasoning if you want eve to develop as a game it is important to have and have the ability to allow or disallow those accounts to be checked by an api check blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp

confirmedi had a socially inept excorp member post some offensive things in a recruitment ad and as ceo i received the warning from ccp i didnt even know about the offensive post until i received the warningthe person who actually posted the offending text didnt receive a warning at all i do not blame ccp for their swift reaction but do think they should also make the ban threats toward the offending player and not just the ceo
i think its more to do with hot dropping i took a mega from catch all the way up to tenal through venal down to fountain ridiculous number of jumps and didnt get engaged by single or even small groups i saw i think primarily because people assume it must be bait for a hot drop i did have small fleets try to kill me i dont want it to become easy either but at the moment its way too much of a time investment to be any longer worthwhile a 3 vs 1 is not what im talking about btw thats hardly a gank
if you dont think its worth the time then dont do it it is what it is maybe try to use your map to see where activity is and dont roam empty systems and yes i guess megathron has a cyno breeze about it when seen solomaybe try jumping into 00 entry systems next time they usually workand roam more it seems like you went on a solo roam once or twice which werent successful roams and you automatically make an assumption that it doesnt work out just try harder its not easy
take a look here 
what about a better idea as so many people wish to get people ratting in 00 for a fight perhaps enabling a ship to have a limited refitting capability would allow the more aggresive ratter to take on the attacker this will increase pvp significantly blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
sadly refitting midfight would be detrimental to most small pvp think rock paper scissors except you get to use both hands instead of just onefrom what i can discern the primary reason people do not pvp isa no interest at all non zero nadab lack of easy targets  see ganking c no solo targetsd omg hotdrop  or fear thereof you need to fix these issues first add better insurance options to cover modules and the like change fw sites to have 30km capture range and a 60km web scram field no more triple stab runners gotta stay and fight
stupid idea is stupid and has been flogged to death on numerous threads there are a lot of people who get kills regardless of local what you purpose is to make it certain that you get a kill a very easy killand talking about immediate intel dotlan have a new function its called npc kill delta so you can narrow down someone ratting very quickly while someone mining is invisible apart from having a report that there are toons in localhigh sec level 4s and incursions will start to look like the only type of ratting to do unless you are one of the major blocks with an intel channel that actually works not a smart move for ccp blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
not to diegress to much but the question really becomes how safe should null sec be for pvers  should it require a camp on pipes or an functioning intel chat to be safe should it be where the moment somebody jumps in system you can identify character corp and standing of the new person in system i have been in null sec with various corps and alliance and the only time i have ever been caught in a ratting ship has been when im moving from system to system and didnt bother to scout iti imagine to most null sec site runners and miners the question is why would they want site running to be more difficult in other words whats in it for me i think with a local change you would have more lazy people exploding and as such you would be able to reward the ratters and miners that ratted and mined better with more isk
its only a small change not supposed to have a dramatic effect howeverit will allow the removal of place holder pos that people put in to prevent use of moonsit will allow the removal of sbus without generating an email and alerting alliances who are attempting to use sbus the way you describedit will allow the removal of tcus without alerting the alliances who dont police or otherwise reside in systems but place them there to prevent others using those systemsthe onus needs to be on the alliances who claim systems to ensure that their assets are not under attack if they fail to see a fleet blapping their assets and fail to see their assets have been damaged and gone into reinforced then its safe to assume they are not really in possession of those systems rather the server is holding those systems for them players and player actions should always be  server
so basically what you have done is made alliance level logistics slightly more of a headache while slowing down actual warfare by 100 that means more time to rep instead of doing alarm clocking to rep shields therefore making it much easier to outright avoid losses twice as long for a reasonable attacker to take system as well as functionally turning the entire game into dreadnaughts online since youd basically double the amounts of fights necessary to take the damn things which would mean that power projection would become that much more valuable to alliances as if sov grind actually needs to be more of a pain in the ass than it already is and all because youre upset you couldnt sneak in a pos bash on the goonies
youre in assembly hall explain your reasoning
your failure to understand what i said is not a problem i have to deal with fortunately its all there and self apparent at that
so you have nothing to say basically not very helpfulin fact i have no slowed it down i have sped it up very significantly if your enemy is lazyconsider period basis at the moment use your map in game and look at pilots in space pilots docked npcs killed etc etc you will come up with virtually nothing at all the entire region is claimed by goons but actually abandoned anyone who is there is not a goon mostly explorers and one or two plexers  rattersnow at the moment even though its abandoned if i took a fleet down there and tried to take sov goons would get a message and form a big fleet up wipe me out with my change i could put every single system in the region into reinforced wait 48 hours and take the lot of them why because theyre undefended thats how the game should be players in system should be noticed and responded to by sov holders in system server should serve not act as an alarm if theyre not there to use and defend the systems then they should lose those systems
you received my input as it was and responded with one sentence what did you expectand once everyone adapts in oh say a week before it goes live since im pretty sure we all can read patch notes and realizes that all they have to do is log in a few times a day to check it little more difficulty involved than what exists nowthen you have doubled the time it takes to take sov in exchange for slightly more work on the part of the alliancecoalition logistics groups at which point the game becomes far more of a grindy horrific shootatbuildings nightmare than it already isopening the window just gives the defender more opportunities to rep the station that the attacker would have to respond to within that timeframe so now instead of having to keep a standing fleet to stop determined repairs for 24 hours you have to do it for 48 insteadyou would literally have turned the meta into deny your opponent as much sleep as possible until they quit
okay then i changed it to 24h
at which point the crux of your entire idea becomes i hate sov holdings notifications and you arent really proposing anything except to nerf something that you personally dont like
no not at all i believe youre simply trolling this thread now either say not supported or supported pretty simple the idea is a tweak to prevent alliances from locking up space and then abandoning it like goons have in period basis it allows for the removal of towers put in place specifically to prevent others from utilizing the moon it allows for small entities to attack sov structures that are not monitored without generating an email and getting wtfpwned 24 hours later
malcanis law
no it simply means that they log in once or twice a day instead and you still get wtfpwned 24 hours later anyway your problem aside from getting butthurt about this failure of yours is actually with power projection not any pos mechanicsand yes those poses are there for denial until they can get to them specifically so that they can avoid as much as possible the utterly unpleasant act of structure shooting and force this unpleasantness upon people such as you its a smart meta play nothing more the goons do that a lot by the way
stop trolling my thread please if you have nothing to say go troll elsewhere

have ccp and the csm made any progress towards fixing 00 sov mechanics if so what
i had written a detailed post but binned it at the end of the day it hardly matters i guess it means that there is no plan to do  so i will continue to potter around until 15th november and at that point xrebirth comes out and i will play that and after that star citizen i like eve but meta gaming is just made so easy by the inability in game to check back on players with multiple accounts this makes spying and infiltration so easy that its not worth trying to build anything because its too easy to take down oops i did in fact reply to you i expect htfu where on the doll did they touch you can i have your stuff you will destroy emergent play in the sandbox that one always makes me laugh as most dont understand one bit what it means but not from you of course i tend to keep tabs on who is important on the game and i have sort of worked out where you sit in the goons i think you realise that no one ever really resists anymore and that is not just down to your overwhelming subcap and soon to be cap superiority or the difficult in taking sov due to massive amounts of hit points its more than that isnt it as you know information is key to winning war and this game makes it so easy to do that by its structure its why any serious player that have the capacity to build something serious decides not to bother either by working out this issue or by finding out the hard way and they just drift away or dont bother so you know that this is one reason why its changing into a blob game because that is the only answerbah this game has the capacity to be truly great but it fails at that point and i dont think ccp have it in them to sort that out it is a real shame anyway i will potter along a bit and drift away not totally as i will keep my main subbed in the vain hope that the required changes are made being an optimistic pessimist that i am did that answer your question i really do wonder if you guys who have won this game as it is now would like to win the game when it really is difficult i think you have it in you certainly the way you pulled it together and won head to head against the elite pvp alliances and one numerous but fairly useless one shows that you are in fact an elite coalition and their coalition is a joke in comparisonedit ok lets go for it at the moment as far as i am concerned eve is basically scammers hello kitty on line but it does look like ccp have finally worked it out i want to play in a hard game not one made hard by meta gaming using accounts and if someone is going to spy then they go all in as a spy player in one major target this makes it really more difficult also if people try to hide accounts then they should be hit with perma bans blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
the beauty with eve is the ability to spy and meta game in such a fashion but you will not agree with that and i have a feeling youve been meta gamed out of either lots of isk or items in game but i would like you to justify why ccp should ban people for hiding accounts from otherslets face it scamming spying theft piracy etc etc is an integral part of eve always has been always will be they even advertise these as features of the game complaining about some or all of them later is much like bemoaning someone check mating you in chessoh and the whole hate on goons line is sooo 2010 time to move on chapdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
does anyone else find this statement extremely oddif there are a lot of people who want to find it why dont they find each other
people rarely do this anymore except perhaps when theyre actively under attack and want to deny the attackers the ability to establish a staging tower and in that case believe me theyre going to know if a pos is attacked outside of that situation if theres a pos there its being used somehow even if its just as a safespot this isnt predominion sovereignty anymore its really not worth the moneysbus are nominally an offensive structure used to render the ihub and station vulnerable so you can attack them so in most cases removing sbus without generating a mail is unnecessary if an alliance is using them in the way that el 1974 describes theyre doing it because theyre under attack and in that situation believe me their attacker knows theyre thereexcept it really wont because the process for system conquest is not show up shoot tcu claim system its rather more involved and if you want to make any suggestions about how sovereignty should work and hope to be taken seriously i suggest you familiarize yourself with how it actually works this article is a pretty good primerand with that out of the waywhy says who if i have through conquest taken space from a foe who says i should not be able to rent access to that space out to interested parties likewise if there are parties interested in making use of nullsec space but who are unable or unwilling to take it by force but willing to pay for it why should they not be able to do so
check the ops post history you will find out why but here ill sum it up for yougrr goons
they still could the only change would be the server not babysitting the system the players who hold it would have to ensure it wasnt being attacked rather than relying on the server to tell themimo player actions and player made content such as sneak attacks in deserted systems should have priority over automation as much as possible
what people usually fail to understand is the peopleware logistic of big alliancesthere is no realistic mechanics that can make easier for a dozen people to take and sustain what a hundred do that is logic math philosophy and what knowledge branch of human thinking you can come up withif you make it harder for a big alliance to keep territory you also make it almost impossible to small one if you make it easy to take you make it as easy to take back and if it was easy for a dozen people to take it is ridiculously easy for a hundred to take back and probably the dozen people will lose a much more significant part of their assets when the turn tables take place then the big alliance lost in the first battlethere is no logic you can come up with that makes sense so a small group of people can take easy what a lot is holding there is simply no reason to make it soif all the people complaining about sov united and gone for it they would get it sooner than asking game to change so they can but that is the nature of things you are complaining sov is hard to take to small corps and you have a small corp exactly because of your inhability to gather a lot of people and coordinate them to achieve what you say it is a matter for a lot of peoplethat makes me think about a reductio ad absurdum of seeing the guatemala army marching over usa territory after conquering sov all over up to mexico lolbut there is always thermopylae or pearl harbor to call to and since the pilgrims and indians we know what happens soon after lol
if they have youll find out about it next thursday
its usually a bad sign when a lowsec evil piwate and omg teh evil goonie are attempting to be the reasonable ones in the thread asking the simple question of substantiating a request for a change to the game and the reply is no u troll gtfooh well vov
we have this guy called digi who would laugh really hard at this
i did reply to you mag is a troll he asked a question which was in the first post so i asked him to read the post and he replied with the same question i was expecting you to at least respond but if you want to hide behind a troll than no issue in this thread i will lay out the issue and my reasoning a troll like mag who i have already had experience with will not be responded to by me because he is a waste of my time and energy blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
 the reasoningfact you can check the api on a single account to verify which characters are on that account at that point in time you can look at their history their kill records and their financial records you can of course check if they have been b
impacts to the gamemuch is said about the bitter vets who control this game my belief and this is where i welcome input not trolls is that many of them have so much isk that they no longer play the game much and due to the ease of scamming by use of different accounts they get their kicks out of destroying corps and alliancesso what is the impact of the ease in which scams can by carried out using the different accounts to make it impossible to guard againstfleet combatit is my belief that blobbing is also created by this issue spies are just impossible to stop anyone can spy if they have multiple accounts as an fc you assume that from the off you have spies this means that you every movement is known that your fleet composition is known that your fcs are known that your anchors are known and that when you call targets the enemy logistics know who to rep up solution blob to such a degree that it does not matterand i have had my own personal experience of having the same number of spies in a fleet as loyal people i found it highly amusing but quite indicative of the issue facing eve when 4 out of 8 people were spies and decloaked the fleet just before we launched bombs that was 50 of the fleet and i count myself in amoung the 8 if you dont find this a striking testement to the issue then nothing will move youalliance sizemany people wonder why there are not more good medium sized alliances well because of the risk of being cleaned out you have two optimum sizes very small so that you know everyone and are pretty secure in that or massive huge alliances with vast resources that can laugh of most heists there is no middle ground in eve als part of the issue here is supers and titan blobs etc but taht is outside of the scope of this argument i have seen a lot of dynamic new alliances get cleaned out and effectively destroyed before they had a chance to make an impactgood new people leave eve i have seen in my time in eve a number of dynamic leader types who were effectively developing their corps and alliances get caught out by this impossible to guard against event the penny dropped that this could not be prevented in anyway they realised that eve while showing much promise as a game was fundementally flawed most give up or decide to potter along at a lower level in those small entities but evantually leaving the game result is that the game stagnates blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
solutionall players mush have a single unified account that they have a tick box that allows them to opt out of enabling people to see their other accounts the api will deliver the full account details of all their charcters across all their accounts if this tick box is ticked this enbles people to check the player of course if peopel refuse to have this checked then it is the choice of the ceo whether to go ahead or not i would notccp will need to police people tryuing to set up more than one unified account they need to make sure that account transfers are logged and detailed so that they can be part of the assesmentthe impact on spyingthis makes spying more of a challenge in which the player will effectively become a spy player against one target this means they ahve to be carefully targetted as only so many people would want to do this this still enables spying but makes it a full game choice with consequencesthe impact on scammingscammng is still possible it has no impact on contract scams isk doubling etc it makes being a scam player difficult and challenging because they cannot hide behind an account they have to actually play within the game to get their target to trust them if people scam under this system you have my respect blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
known trolls will not be responded to nor will i be responding to people coming out with the typical low intelligent replies like where on the doll can i have your stuff eve is a sandbox you dont understand it if you use that it destroys emergent gameplay the inability to check multiple accounts destroys emergent gameplay or referring to people who would laugh at this i laughed at you as being the typical unintelligent response one gets on eve forums by the troll typei would point out to ccp that you have new challenges to deal with true you will upset a lot of bitter vet types but i would put forth the view that these people are one of the reasons why eve does not grow using the account structure to scam makes them very powerful and destructive you need to act on this issue and to be blunt the tos approach will not work first of all it will tie you down in a huge amount of red tape and gm investigation and also produce many unfair rulings often due to the fact that the gms will be snowed under scams are an integral part of the game they are however out of control and made impossible to guard against due to the game structurebut being able to play with multiple toons is an important part of the game that i would hate to lose so enabling people still to have more than one toon active is important and ccp should not do anything that stops people from having multiple toons on the go blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
1 your original posts did not answer the question now you have2 mags wasnt trolling3 how does ccp go about implementing this what are the consequences then of not optingin to a unified account system are you suggesting that ccp forces everyone to have all their accounts unified or receive the banhammer why would i link my accounts knowing your intentions for having them linked when for example i run my alt accounts through a different email address and just plex them not giving the alt account a definite connection to the main account that ccp wouldnt waste essential dev manhours looking into and investigating for not following a unified account system
you can bypass a unified account check by setting up eve on a separate computer running an ip scrambler or relay using two different forms of paymentat best it will look as if two different people are playing eve at worst it will look as if two different people are playing eve from the same house you would not be able to automaticallymechanically distinguish whether the accounts are playing in tandem or are separate instead you would have to observe them and given than there are 12 to 15 accounts per player someone fact check me on this this is what i recall or 100 to 250k alt accounts out of a total account population of 500k 20 to 50 of the total subscribers of eve i highly doubt that ccp would be able to manually enforce with a staff of 700 because that is what they currently do with regards to botting and rmt they manually check and observe over a long period of time to make sure the account is actually guilty of tos violationsand even if you take the extra half step and ask for ccp to ban multiple accounts because thats where you are totally going with this youd run into the same problem
1 i thought it did but i wont quibble2 i have had previous experience with him if you note he was asking if i would ban people for scamming when i only mentioned perma banning for people trying to get around having a single unified account3 i am suggesting that ccp force everyone to have a unified account however note that i have suggested an opt out tick box where you can decline to divulge all your characters ccp would have an ip address of everyone linking to their servers of course some will use methods to hide that in terms of checking its easy to record ip adresses and run algorithims against it of course you will have grey areas like multiple players playing from a work ip address but i would think they play from home at times and this could be checked out blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
 setting up on a seperate computer well that is not an issue you use algorithms to check and flag and check a pattern easy done ip scramber or rely yes could be done but bear in mind that people are having to jump through additional hoops a lot o
so a frat house full of nerds playing eve online is pretty much 
not really as many would hopefully be setup properly and as long as you have initial account payment details you should be good blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
again as i usually feel like starting my posts people like to complain about everythingone of the peopleware game mechanics eve has to offer is the rest on trust as the sole means of linking one entity to anotherthere is absolutely no reason to start putting mechanics in place to make it so you can get hard asurance of peoples honestylots of what goes on in eve that you cant see in other mmos rely on the feeling of social uncertanty you have you may talk to me in one char about me in another char or see i talking to myself without knowing what is going on lots of interesting stuff happens in those situations not only that but the situation in which the proof you can give of your entity relation to another entity is the same you can do about the relation of one of your entities to someone elsesthis is one aspect that makes individuality really kick in in eve universe you cant trust someone is someone else want them or notit is not only a matter of me telling subject a that i am this and that entity but one subject a talking to a subject b without my knowledge or consentiment that one entity and another are in fact mepolitics run wild on that uncertanty and the inability of proving you or anyone else is someone else beyond dubt is something that wrecks so many aspects of the game i cant really count them all
what i am suggesting is to make such activity harder and a much greater effort and require real gameplay it is not to put in place a mechanic to get assurance of honesty it is in my opinion something required for game balance and ultimately for the continuation of eve one thing i have noticed since i joined in 2009 is that the game is pretty stagnent new blood never really gets a look in does it and this issue is one of the major reasons why based on the power that a large number of older players have in terms of isk and accounts due to this certain groups have no uncertainty they have excellent intel on other groups and can attack their very foundations with ease the key thing for me is to remove part of their power and as such change the way alliances develop or more accurately the reason why they do not developbut another aspect that you have to consider is that it is just too easy and there is no defence against it middle sized entities have to trust their members to try to take a slice of 00 and when they do they are really vulnerable as assets being moved or assets put into the field are so easy to take out either by use of spies for a drop or by stealing themyou may call it a complaint but i have been playing games since the early 80s i have designed and run my own game and in my opinion this game just misses that piece to make it truly great because in a game you have to play the game not game the game which is what this structural issue enables blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
i had to look back at this previous experience and you pretty much acted the same way then ignoring questions and calling nameswhy shouldnt i ask you questions about your idea you basically want to restrict certain forms of play with  people will be able to get around of course not only that because as ccp encourage scamming spying theft etc they most certainly wouldnt go down the route of banning players for not using a unified account system because they may wish to partake in a form of play that ccp endorsesthen we have to question whether the unified system would even divulge the information you require sure it may link accounts but ccp may deem this information private or give the option to make it so youre taking very large leaps of faith that your idea and vision of  is that of ccpsits a game thats all it is a game one that thrives on the very things you seem to hate player driven content ccp even makes videos about it the causality trailer springs to minddestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
this drop a few cans enough for decloaking dropping too many and youll get paid a visit by a gm how many is too many there is no hard and fast number afaik so be a be judicious
sometimes i really try to see the logic in which people make some requests because i want to see the links in their ideas and maybe enjoy them but anything involving solo activities in mmorpgs is really hard took to have some tutorial or pass time activities soloable like missions or duels and such but changing an entire mechanic of the game to privilege a solo executing activity in a mmo game is really shamefuloh sov is hard to gain because big alliances get it easier than small corps the solution is simple join a big alliance or try to make one trying to make one is really the best effort for those using that argument because hopefully they will realise how hard it is to rise even a chaotic big alliance and how the work being successful has a just reward in the ease it brings to the game for those participatingoh i want to sit in peace in a place and pvp only with someone i choose to get a rts or fps and do it all the time you want as much as ccp make eve a place where people can do theirs alone in peace as much the universe will seem unrealistic and alienatingoh people are not doing what i want them to well the mmo part is intended to make that happen and if you are not happy with that choose a nonmmo to play sure there is lots of games you can find eve experience without all the people not doing what you want them to or no one to do what you dont want doneeve is about corps alliances fleets and community and if you have mechanics backing up the solo activities you are making the game less not more
i have made this point as well over in fi if the expected loss goes up it could be balanced by an increase in the expected benefit thus the game becomes more exciting and nobody is made worse off
this isnt what you said though you said null sec should be used for fighting for and keeping space not renting space you dont need to others full stop yet if ive conquered a ton of extra space well i can farm it out to renters to use it and report back to me if an intruder tries to come in while maintaining core regions for myself all that space would be monitored by people living in it rather than the server and youd be back here talking about the next fix about how large alliances shouldnt be able to this or cant be allowed to that as though the large scale playstyle is somehow invalidso yeah id be the last person to disagree that sov needs a lot of work but id rather it be done by people who know the mechanics and have less of an axe to grind
if you want to argue my fallacious motivations suggested by the guy trolling this thread you do so elsewhere do you have any comment on the change i suggested
you mean thisand even if you discount the fact that theres more butthurt in that thread than on the average tailor swift cd its still very relevant because it explains why you are posting what you are its the only experience with sov that you have had and it has effected your perceptions of the mechanic which by the way doesnt disqualify you from talking about the topic but it certainly does need to be taken into consideration by people who you want to take you seriously oh and your idea is just plain bad and it shows that the person suggesting it has little to no idea what they are talking about thats my comment sov sucks your idea at least its second draft anyway would make it suck slightly more and does not address the underlying problems in any way its an obvious grr goonsmotivated targeted nerf to something that you personally dont like
im not the person stalking my threads and making personal attacks how about you engage your brain and tell me what is wrong with it rather than your idea is just plain bad or are you really a 3rd grader
i already have
nah all youve done is make bitter personal attacks and troll
pointing out that your opinion is obviously colored by a failed attempt to take sov is not a personal attack telling you that your idea is godawful is not a personal attack and what i am about to tell you that you clearly have a problem with me and have thus only skimmed what i said and as a result think im trolling and havent already explained perfectly well why your idea is godawful is not a personal attack and telling you to get over yourself isnt trolling its actually fairly helpful advice in eve just because you cant take sov all on your own whats more and tell yourself that somehow automated warnings are at fault does not make that a problem for anyone else sov is broken yep has been for years pretty much since they implemented it and it has tons of problems but receiving evemails when your assets are under attack is not among them
youre totally refusing to tell me why its a bad idea try harderedit oh yeah i have never had nor ever wanted to take sov nor even attempted to take sov therefore i can not have made a failed attempt to take sovi tried to blow up a customs office and shoot an onlining tcu how the hell is that trying to take sov 
and the only reason you think its a problem is because you are looking to spread blame for a failed attempt at taking sov thats it the end you are arguing about a non issue and thats why its a bad idea
i have never tried to take sov lol i tried to blow up a onlining goon tcu and a few months ago i shot a customs office thats hardly trying to take sov it was more trying to damage some abandoned stuffwhen you read words you need to try to understand them not just fill in the meaning with your own silliness now tell me why its a bad idea im suspecting you dont know yourself
since youre determined to make this go in circlesnon issue as in its only a problem for you also if the two are unrelated which i highly doubt their timing is suspect
wowlet me give you a bit of help if i have an opinion you dont agree with  the sky is red  then you dont simply say its a non issue you say no the sky is blue because your opinion hereyou see since were dealing with opinions its not sufficient to tell me my opinion is invalid because your opinion negates it this is the basis of communication and discussion when you say its a non issue but you fail to explain why then you are simply trying to enforce your own opinion on others without any explanation this shows you lack the ability to properly communicateso please if you would explain why its a nonissue
heh no if you say the sky is red i say what are you on or lay off the saucesame thing applies here
ok then unless you have something of value to add to the discussion ill simply ignore your ranting on it have a nice one 
well i believe you should only get a message from the server if your in the same region that something of yours is getting attacked communication should only travel so far i cant see that market in a different region why should i be able to see something getting attacked but i do believe i should know if something is getting attacked if im near it at least in the same region that way i can go and defend it i do believe someone should be able to take a area and control that area but they must also defend it even if they dont utilize it at the time denial of an area is another fun part of the game hence gate camps 
i think i see your logic as far as markets and distancehowever i can see all contracts all over eve so how does that work in the scheme of things what i do not understand is why is the big push to punish folks that actually took the initiative and the willingness to take on full time job herding autistic squirrels
you can gank the pod in fact i cleared a belt on one of my first ganks left one skiff alive before concord got my ship was not thinking about warping and the skiff got his drones on my pod i sent him a good kill mail because it was when i got out of the test tube back at the space station even he got my pod i lost next to nothing as my gank pilot i do not fit expensive implants or anything that does not help me boost my dps as for the walking around parliament naked do you think the rest of parliament would sit around and do nothing not run attack etc while they watched members being killed well in most mine belts i fly in the miners do
hmmm ive not been suicide ganked ever when ive mined in high sec all i can think is you are mining somewhere that has lots of people around so therefore they are targeting youmoving is a good plan then
classice troll behaviour is to pick a question close to the subject matter and flog it to death that is my experience with you and i make no apologies for calling you out on it in those threads but seeing as you asked reasonable questions i will give you the respect of a replyof course people will try and will get around it but that is why you need a perma ban threat not for scamming to make sure you understand that this is also where we differ where is it play to use another account with no link at all to your real main and yet use that account to assist the policy and direction and even wallet of your main that is not play its using the structural mechanics to enable you to easily infiltrate and then executeyou like many assume that ccp fully endorses scamming i actually doubt that you noticed that certain key ccp personal have moved on and both were pro scamming one in particular did that to make isk when he played and nothing else also i think it was because it was just too difficult to control that being said i have no issue with scamming my issue is simply that the structure of accounts makes it impossible to protect yourself and that recruitment is a complete lottery on the other side this makes scamming ultra easy and hardly a challenge keep thinking i am against scamming but in my view if someone does it because they get fed up of the ceo cool if someone plays as a scammer cool but here is the rub they have to play entirely as a scammer you say that ccp would not go down the route of banning people for this well i have become aware of ccp being rather quick to ban people recently without any real explanationif you had read my suggestion you would note that i had a tick box option for the player whether to allow this information to be gathered by the api and that the tick box status would be reported as part of the api this gives a player the option not to give this data but i like many others would not accept that personi make no leap of faith that the developed this way is what ccp wants to do i hope it is something they will doi dont hate scamming it might surprise you to know that i read cp a lot and i have laughed my head off at psychotic monk note that he is doing it with that toon of course he uses the account issue to do it too but i like it when he uses his main the fun part was that he actually joined a corp in pirate nation when we were in delve couple years back whose ceo was really bad at security and when we saw him in this corp we just cracked up damn if people are not able to check someone like that they deserve itback to the troll part it is obvious to me that you did not read what i put up if you really want to discuss things like this then read the subject matter and digest before posting otherwise i think you are trolling because trolls just focus on one thing like you dont like scamming and flog it to death and come up with comments ignoring what was said in the original post which is what you have donebut ccp may deem this information private or give the option to make it somy suggestion inlcuded that option go back and read it blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
for those of you that go on about ccp endorsing scamming lets take the the video where a pilot loses a rifter to an alliance he later joins that alliance gets to a high position and then rips them off causing the alliance to collapse the key thing to note is that this is the same character who was blown up in the rifter like many i have no issue with this scenario if you are so sure about ccp supporting scamming in terms of the issue i have raised about different accounts then they would have produced a video showing that the character was another one and not the character that was blown up though if they had shown it being another character they would have shown the reality of eve which perhaps is not such a good thing to advertiseedit new eve video shows player logging on someone with a toon from 2003 bored hmmm what to do what to do oh lets check some of my scam accounts goes onto alliance forums hmm alliance x who i told i was away for rl but gave me access to the fleet hanger is starting a campaign hmmmm nice he plexes up the account and logs in finding people mostly off line and the corp hanger in the staging system called fleet is full of all the ships that the alliance is going to use he moves his toon there then takes everything sends mail to ceo nooooooooobceo logs on to find this catastrophe the entire campaign is stopped dead people are upset and the reality hits him he apologises and leaves the gamethe bloated fruit fly effect in all its gory if i see ccp doing a video like that then i will agree with you blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
my point regarding that information was about unified account management i could have made this clearer but with your current attitude im not sure it would have made a differenceim saying they may look upon this information to be private as in not even include it in the api database or give you an option if you wish it to be this would mean even if you had that part of the api checked it still might not show the info you are afteryoure vision of how ccp view scamming and how they would alter to match that vision isnt something i remotely recognise you could of course point to postsarticles that back this view you think ccp has in order to substantiate this stance but i doubt you will tbh i have a feeling that what ccp deem as improving the game is a far cry from your idealsdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
ccp arent going to ban thousands of accounts because of a hurtebutte loon
i understood what you were saying there and i repeat it if the player wishes to keep his characters private then he can chose not to tick the box that enables this check but the information will be flagged as not showing all accounts that will work for me some naive fools may still recruit him but i wont so this gives the ceos of corps what so many want the ability to assess people for multiple accounts you may not think that this does not give me the information that i am after but i would be very happy with thatof course you dont recognise it but it really depends what you want to do in game if your entire game is based on sitting next to a gate in rancer setting off smart bombs then you are hardly going to worry about corporate recruitment are you again i am not knocking that as a style of play hell i find low sec much more dangerous then 00 and i know people who actually know your corp well and respect them but if you are not able to at least see this issue and think through the impacts of it then there really is no point in engaging with me because at the end of the day you are adding nothing to the debate apart from your feelingsi have seen a couple of things that make me believe that ccp is starting to realise this is an issue one of which was a certain developer who was very pro scamming and only did that as a player move on followed by the tos clarification i have also heard of some people getting bans which was very interesting indeed if you fail to recognise those signs as showing a particular stance by ccp then that is not my issueof course when one puts forward ideas it is often to ones own benefit i want to see more alliances getting stuck in to 00 and take space and i seriously believe that this is something that will help make that possible i am not ignoring the other issues but i feel this one is just as important as super blobs anyway if ccp does not make this change then they still have a broken game this is what a friend said to me when i discussed this issue its says it allthank you for giving the thread another bump blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
thank you from you that is a complimentedit i know you and i dont think much of each other however what you said here is interesting thousands of banned accounts i guess that confirms the level of multiple account scamming in the game by bitter vets the type of people who would be prepared to try to get around it i know you have plenty of contacts in the bitter vet group so sorta gives the scale of the issue blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp

you make a statement then back off with it what do you mean by that statement either you think its thousands or you dont what is it and dont hide behind trying to get the thread locked by hurling insults either you think it will result in thousands of accounts being banned or you have no view and threw in a quick throw away commentedit in terms of a compliment i took it as one because of my own opinion of youedit i just ralised you said had not affected me sorry you are wrong because it is so easy there is certain game play that i would never bother attempting because of this issue like many i have not been caught because i keep it small and tightly controlled blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
no you dont understand it at all i mean not a part of the api database at all the same way that your account name payment details address etc isnt a part of that databasethis would mean the followingif ccp allowed us the option of showing we would have person a has 4 accounts but decides in the account management section he wishes this to remain personal information when person a gives his full api it will only show the one account and the up to 3 characters on it person b has 4 accounts but he decides in the account management section he wishes to divulge this information when person b gives his full api it will show all the linked accounts and each and every character on themif ccp deemed it personal we would have all accounts would show 3 characters only in other words it would be of no use to you at alli have been involved in recruitment in the past and i agree its not easy but then thats one of the reasons i love eve many of its aspects are not easy but that doesnt entitle me to certain personal account information as far as your evidence regarding ccps stance on scamming is concerned was that it it was circumstantial at best tbhdevs well they come and go tos wording well yes it changes and gets clarified always has always will maybe you could point to the change and why its changes ccps stance on scammingas far as these bans you mention are concerned context and evidence is requiredso no still not seeing it as you havent provided much in the way of proof to alter thatdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
but that is not what i am suggesting what i was asking for was that the api would detail those other accounts and all their characters if ticked and if not ticked would detail the single account and would indicate that the player was not prepared to divulge additional account information by doing that a ceo can take a decision without being in the dark some might be persuaded by the awesomeness of the player and his account others like me would go meh and decline his applicationand for me its game information not personal player information glad to hear that you have been involved in recruitment so you understand that its not easy what i dont like is impossible and the account side of things makes it impossible to verify the risk and the fact that a player has multiple accounts is not personal information in my viewthere was a thread in cp about the tos started by a member of the shadow cartel and in that someone started talking about some recent bans he was aware of he intimated that they were as a result of scamming
i know thats not what you are suggesting but im suggesting that may be the case im saying you may think youre entitled to know this info but ccp may think otherwise in your view which may not be ccps which is my pointoh and that thread was about someone impersonating someone else which as far as im aware has always been taboo in fact its not the first time someone has tried to impersonate the big c and come foul of ccps wrathnot only that but he also edited wiki pages to show incorrect information so i can fully understand why ccp updated their tos to clarify their stance on such matters and banned his assbut that doesnt help you make your casedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
maybe but it is not personal information as defined by various data protection acts so i really cannot see them having an issue with it the issue is whether they could setup a unified account and police it which is the issue i think yeah i know what the thread was about read the blog too excellent blog by the way also i have read up fully about this incident and agree with you on ccps actionsas regards to making a case i am focussed on the issue which is most problematic to game play and which makes scamming so easy and lethal i fully expect ccp to do nothing this says it all doesnt it
i assumed the story line explanation of why the planets dont move is because we are all flying in faster than light spacecraft ie warp drive the planets are moving so slowly they seem to be standing still from our perspective i still wonder why the official explanation of how jump gates works says it uses the gravity of two suns to create an artificial wormhole but i have only ever seen one sun in every system its another minor detail but how hard could it be to add an extra sun theres a lot of things about the eve universe that dont reflect the actual physics of space for example the way our spacecraft move is a lot more like a submarine than a spaceship its as though we are traveling through a fluid medium and not the virtual vacuum of space an actual spacecraft would travel more like a brick on ice you would turn on your propulsion modules and you would just go faster and faster nothing would slow you down until you turned your rocket exhaust in the direction of your destination exactly half way through your trip combat in space would be pretty difficult if not impossible in the vastness of space it would be pretty unlikely that two spacecraft would ever be able to pinpoint one another much less intercept one another once you located your enemy they would be gone to who knows where it would be a lot like shooting down a specific bullet using another bullet in the desert at night even if you did manage to catch up with another ship simply turning your ship around so that your rocket exhaust was facing the enemy would do a lot more damage than lasers or bullets or missiles theres a lot of heat and radiation propelling your ship forwards cloaking ships would be impossible since the energy signatures of a ship could be seen clearly from half way across the solar system even now from earth we would be able to see the rocket trails from the space shuttle from as far away as jupiter
your point about only one sun around to work the jump gate you are forgetting about the sun at the other end of the artificial worm hole at the exit jump gatejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
settling in a wormhole is kind of the same thing isnt it
i dont see this as adding anything to the game to be totally honest it would just take up resources better used almost anywhere else without any real gameplay benefit 
i actually like that idea because it does create a conflict driver and gives people a slice of space which they would want to defendof course the 00 splergelords will hate it and block it they want you in their mega fleets pressing f1 under 10 tidi and anything that devalues 00 by making hs more interesting is a big no no edit i think jint is correct remove item 4 blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp

i suggested this as a way to fix lowsec have gambling and pleasure hubs but only in lowsec space why only in lowsec well for one thing highsecurity space isnt meant to be too comfortable amarr is a theocratic feudal state caldari is a fascist corptocracy and so on its a nice safe nest to start out in but there should be an incentive to venture further into more dangerous areas i dont see any of the high sec governments being tolerant of the practice of gambling low sec should have the feel of the frontier a kind of step away from the safe and settled worlds of the east and into the fortunes of the wild wild west frontier saloons with gambling prostitution drinking etc would reflect that element of danger and adventure like moe eisleys bar in star wars gambling is what brought people into the deserts of nevada and it was the mafia that did it gambling is just the sort of thing to bring more people into lowsec as well after all its not as though pirates would only be interested in killing each other or shooting anything that moves they would be living in lowsec for a reason freedom ideological differences lifestyle choices and of course economic opportunities as someone has already pointed out there are already lots of off site gambling sites which use isk and are eve themed ccp is really missing out on some additional revenue and opportunity here as well as a potential isk sink to combat the inflation problem

its bad because the sov mechanics are intended to trigger pvp your idea is aimed at avoiding pvp
i dont see how it would cause less pvpimo the timers make it possible for the following to occur1 goonswarm currently the biggest and most powerful alliance drops tcus all over a region nobody attacks them because they know that once they go into reinforced in 24 hours theyll have to fight an unwinnable fight against goons who will have the time to gather and prepare less fights2 a powerful allliance like goons has lots of space more than they can actually use they hardly go into that space at all instead of using it they rent it out to other groups as long as those groups are renting out the space theyre not fighting for space other groups that also rent out space from the same alliance dont fight their neighbor renters because theyll get kicked less fights3 a small roaming gang wants to blap some assets they know if they try to blap anyone but a small corps or alliances assets that theyll get owned since most of the space in game is now owned by large alliances they dont blap stuff no roaming gangs less fights
so if i understand it correctly youre saying fight against goons are unwinnable so sov mechanics should be changed so people can take goon sov and destroy their structures without a fight
thats what i took away from it yeah please change something i personally dislike because grr goons because god knows that you shouldnt be able to have a victory you earned so long as people dislike youalso please note how those examples given above are not due to a mechanic but due to a meta element cowardice ccp cant fix cowardice
if you stop to pay close attention almost everybody asks for changes only when something is of their disliking and very few people can really ask for changes that improve the game as a wholeall the sov whine since the start is based on the idea that it is a part of the game entitled to anyone as a forceful progressioni guess it is news to most players that eve is not a game of streamlined progress it is not because you was piloting a frigate and now you pilot a destroyer that you leveled upthis egocentric idea makes the game what it is not mechanics the idea many players have that the game is made to armies of one person is what brings the problems most people complain about
nah im not at all interested in taking sov i have played solo since 2003 been in one gang probably for 5 minutes i dont have nor ever will be in or have an alliance however i see a problem with the mechanics so im pointing it out conflict in eve benefits everyone me you all its what drives the economy no one wants sims in space which is where goons are heading with their antipvp rental program
so what makes you an authority on how sov mechanics work or should work then perhaps people who are dealing with them every day for years know what theyre talking about
cool rally up the troops and go that way  and create conflict and content tia
no conflict at alllook up what sovereignity means no conflict therelook up that there is no reason at all to imply that a small corp deserve sovereignity more than big alliances there is no reason to say that people have to use the space they conquer no even in real life it is that waythe whole premisse is based on the assumption i already said people take that eve is a streamline progression game and you have the right to enjoy every aspect of the game eve is a universe kind of game and it is stated loud everywhere the sandbox style they have things that arent supposed to be soloable or such there is really no argument you can make that imply the inherent right for sov to small corps more or equal to big corpsthis flawed assumption that plagues eve community into not evolving people just stagger in lots of small corps fighting for small things wanting big things and blaming the few that understands the principle of the game and seek to create the community in the sense the game always was meant to beeve would be the cream of the crop if you had dozen huge alliances instead of the huge number of alliances compoosed by half dozen corps of three members that is why all mechanics involving large scale seem flawed it is because no one cares to build large scale
i dont have to engage in an activity to know a lot about it been playing eve since 2003 i know how it works
time in service has nothing to do with competence of the subjecti have had quite a few vets that never left high sec swinging there life time achievement epeen of playing the game for years and not have a clue about the inter workings and the mechanics of nul let alone losec so i ask you how does making a claim that you have actually played the game since 2003 qualify you to point out the things you think are wrong and have the solutions the only reason i pose this question is that your approach is that of an expert but the only shred of any proof is some claim that you actually played this game since 2003 your argument is not substantive it is more based on emotional world view of how you see things and you really do not like it very much when others disagree
i would point out that the changes i suggested and the mechanics involved are sound and not incorrectthe replies i have been getting have all been emotionally based they lean towards my motivations irrelevent knowledge of mechanics irrelevent and based on assumptions as to my knowledge and why its not fair for big alliances to not receive emails emotive irrelevant almost no attention to whether or not receiving or not receiving emails from the server is a good or bad idea which is rather unfortunate as thats what this forum is for suggesting ideas
ccp spitfire wrote added this here if you havent read the sticky please read it highlighted the parts that seem to be being ignored please stop the trolling and derailing and focus on the idea
i have read it and understand it also you need to understand what a troll is and what is being relayed here in this thread is a disagreement to your view that is not trolling everyone wants to kneejeck and call someone a troll because they do not align with their way of thinking which is about the same thing as you calling others stupid for voicing their dislike or opinions to your ideas
i havent called anyone stupid i was called stupid again this has nothing to do with the proposal so unless you have something to say regarding the idea im not really all ears im not interested in your opinion of what or what is not a troll i dont care if you like soup before bed or think quiet walks on a beach suck my idea your comments otherwise thank you
sorry if you are so emotionally invested in this and my tenner was not of an attack it was merely addressing the issue you had with everyone not liking your idea just an observation so chill out francis now as far as your original post it comes across as the big guys have the resources and are not using it and will not share unless i pay them i for some reason seeing this turning back unto the small guy in a big way and this will not help them one bit
so explain privateers
i founded privateers as a corporation invited anyone and everyone who wanted to join to join and go about their business of killing the alliances i handed it over to surreptitious though as i had to stop playing eve so i could concentrate on studies they then formed the privateer allianceim not at all emotionally invested in anything i proposed an idea and rather than discuss the idea i get 3 pages of stupid comments from people that really cant explain why its a bad idea but insist it is or like yourself decide to cross examine me on my personal motivations prior corporation employment and sincerityi have better things to do than lie about how i like to play eve
this post may have been also overlook for some timelike you i am a person of management and i find really annoying to manage business in a business like way using the tools intended for that task that is why i employ alts for said tasksone thing i coupled with that is the ability to have alts in each major trade hub doing trade stuff and managing stuff and using external websites to give intel to other peoplei assume that corporation management is something that will be at the bottom of the priority list because the players themselves dont use that only a few of us the majority are in different points of view business industrial etc but asking for the same things ships sov things skill training and so onyou have to keep on mind that the development of eve has shown a sinuous path until now and each expansion bad reception leads to another skew towards another goal first you have an expansion about ships people complain that ships arent the only problem then you have expansion about content then people complain that content is not the issue then you have an expantion about pvp people complain that pvp is not the issue then you have an expansion intended to create an amazing integration plan with dust and people dismiss it as dress up play expansion so we are back to ships and contenteve devs are concerned too much to what players want but most players have no clue about what is in the realm of game mechanics and what is the realm of l2p so too much effort of devs is spend in fixing what is not broken and laying down ground signs for stupid people to find what they claim not existent until it is flashing over the uithey most likely do not have time to sit over aspects of the game few people use or are inclined to learn to
i am mostly asking for a cleanup of the corporation management section and a return to the usefulness of contracts the former being something that is absolutely necessary because as it is it is too easy for a corp to fall victim to a permissions loophole due to bad programming the latter being something that would help increase the flow of goods between people and therefore strengthen the economy of eve itself the rest is just ideas of crap you could jam into it to make it a full expansion id settle with a minor patch
when i was in the csm this was one of the issues i pushed for and i believe its part of the reason we have all the discussion of pos mechanics revamping another thing which was in dire need of a change when we had the questions about the one thing wed change i said the whole corporation mechanic leadership poses wardecs roles etci supported it then and i still do now all aspects of corporations need work as theyre one of the hingepoints of this game unlike fw and exploration which are still valuable but not necessary or pertinent to the majority of the playerbase
industrialists are not left behind by ccp they are left behind ones by the othersthe big difference between what evolves in warfare and what evolves in industry is the approach players have to each aspect most industrial pilots sit back do what is there to be done and complain about what is not therewarfare pilots on the other hand go active and develop ways to use what the game have to their endsit is logical that the approach from warfare pilots renders them more attention and more specific demandsindustrialists are usually not fierce and cunning about what they do and they want just that easy profitable or whatever ways laid down by mechanicsthe is not really a huge abyss between mechanics for combat and for industry the difference is that industry is only used as it is showed to rather than innovative and inventive yes those two are different things ways warfare is daily sought to be doneit is time for industrialists to start thinking like strategists and activelly bringing industry to the spotlight and stop asking for the spotlight to be lit over them

 because in real life i had the lolsyeah because in real life one country goes to the un and formalize a war declaration lolok i admit that present wardec system is a joke and one thing i agree to the in real life argument that it is a little insane that lets say the caldari state would allow people to blow themselves up right beside the town hall it is simply not very realistic that you can make war on hisec and that brings the idea that the only reason wardecs exist is to find ways for people to do pvp alone in peace with only people they want which is at the same time a turn off on the verge to go to low and null sec and a turn off for a lot of new playersin this case i think war dec should be put aside altogether and leave it to a simple set said corp to low standing and let people go to areas where they can blow themselves up that solves a lot of problems and sure will make a lot of new players join the game and stay in the gamepopulation of hisec will most likely always be majority but wardecs higest valued ore by qtyprice ratio and the certanty of any action being bailed out by some npc rat bashing is a bit overkill if the idea is to keep the hisec population all happythe moment you cannot blow people up in hisec and mining isnt that profitable people will seek places to do it right now the best place to do it is in hisec and ccp seems to enjoy it so you have everything being made easy to be done in hisec
so to recapthe issue is that there are a number of players who play eve for a totally different game its not about spaceships for them but the meta game of stealing stuff and ruining corps and causing havoc for others they are very destructive in terms of the game in my opinion making the development of a corp or alliance very difficult because you can be sure to have one of these in your corp or alliance they will spy organise hot drops and clean you out militarily you have no chance because they have greater numbers and huge capital fleets you on the other hand are not even safe shooting a poco in secret there is no secret unless you keep it so small and then your firepower is not enough this is the impact on the game at a strateguic levelso i suggested a way to reduce this impact unfied accounts with a ban penalty for trying to get around this of course the question is whether ccp would be able to do thisi have one member of the csm reply malcanis and his reply is revealing he talks about thousands of accounts being banned until he realises what a whooper he made and tries to bluster around it think abou it he is a 00 player who moves within the circle of players that control 00 he owes his position on the csm to those people voting him as an alternative he is active on the eve forums and external eve forums everything he says is to nerf hs and push people to 00 and here he details the scale of it unintentionallymy feeling was that there was a significant number of old players who were scamming behind multiple accounts thousands of accounts in fact and i am grateful to malcannis for confirming to me what i suspected even though that was not what he intendedas for his comment about being butt hurt of course i am it is only just recently i worked out the scale of this issue and its impact and its right up there with super cap blobs and the sov system anyway no point in flogging this to death so back to playing watching and waiting the fun part is that the initiaive are now in my operational area so i can shoot some of malcaniss scrubs yay blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
still not an argument just a i want it because i like it and whatever what other people think line of speechbottom line ismmorpgs are supposed to rely on individuality of entities not on individuality of people when you start making things mechanically different for entities because they have the same irl holder things start to get messey all the sidekick account thing for example is borderline gameplay interferent but still notkasenumi for new eden is one person and lets say jane doe is another when you start putting mechanics in place that change jane does new eden life in the function of she being kasenumi alt you are putting in place gameplay interference which will lead to paid advantages beyond what is already untolerable to many as multiboxingimagine if multiboxing was coupled with mechanics leading to ingame resources directed to facilitate anything to entities of the same holder it is already enough that entities of the same holder bear that advantage bearing the same holder
so your concept is trust the player to play as the individual character rather naive and trusting isnt it but in truth that person can be handled by refusing to allow that data to be included in the api character search so no issue and the ceo gets the ability to see that he does in fact run other accounts and has the choice to say nah too much of a security riskas for actually i made a full argument about it in this thread and those that dont like it are either pirates or 00 people who of course wont like it for obvious reasons and you cannot look at these forums as giving any real backing or not because the forums are heavily slanted towards the two player types i just mentioned those that would most probably agree with my suggestion dont tend to post on eve forums because they see no point in it having had multiple where on the doll did that nasty man touch you type comments proves nothing blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
there is no mandatory reason to have accounts linked because there is no reason for such asurance either in a positive way for yourself or in a mandatory way you are not making any argument towards a real reason your argument is based on what you would like for yourself not in something that would actually make the game better as a whole that is what it boils down toit is not naive nor trust it is to accept the way things areif we start making room for linked entities in the game you start really to employ the pay to win strategy once you have ways to link and identify accounts it is the start more inventive ways can be put in place to aggravate this into advantagesthere will be no disadvantage i can have in less than 2 hours in the average and in less than 30 mins in the right times of the day a eletronic credit card mobile internet perfectly good to play once i used my broadband to download and voila if i dont want to have my accounts linked and face the downsides of it i can and if i want to have them linked to take the advantages of it i can so linking accounts can only be to enjoy the advantages it will bring and no downside of mandatory link can be really enforced unless you are a softcore player who wont be bothered to avoid themthere is one player that showed this method employed to play with multiple trial accounts that should not be played in bulk when something cannot be enforced it cannot be mandatory just for the sake of appearanceso i can only see this as an effort to mess up the game into something unrealisticthe thing is for me you do business with aakiwa as her and with jane doe as her you wont need for any reason to do business with either based on the asurance that they belong to one single account holder i am not saying this is enough to trust i am saying more than this make the game less
the argument you made is basically with your self you can sit there rocking back forth swearing you are tinkerbell but it does not prove out the argument that it is valid
i have laid out quite clearly why it would benefit the game that you are incapable of seeing it is not my issue the reason are quite clear let me repeat it for youand this is made so easy due to the inability to check back on multiple accounts therefore corp scams and infiltration are rampent within the game and there is no way to protect yourself against this in game this then distorts the game in a number of ways that are quite obvious if you look or have the wit to see it the game is much less for this and the fact that spying is so damn easy all laid out in page 1 of this threadand of course i would like it eve is currently meta gamers kitty online it is so easy for them they dont have to even try much did you see that word try the steps you explained to get around it take effort many people would not bother a large group will but like anything they will make mistakes yes the question is whether ccp have it in them to check back on this and yes its highly unlikely but if it removes at least a number of them its a start if you think that i see it as a complete way to solve the issue it is not its just like fighting bots it takes effortits just the way things are defeatist rubbish blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
ezslider sticks and stones the only argument i was having with my self was whether to continue to play eve and also how i would play based on this issue my original plan was of course to go for sov but now i have decided to have some fun with the assets i had built up it is a great long term game and is hard except for corp thieves and infiltrators its too easy for them i tend to like to play hard games but if the game involves a structural weakness that makes it too hard and you have no way to deal with it in game then that is akin to head butting a wall or trying the same thing again and again expecting a different result i play for a challenge not to be a patsy for some inadequate who can only succeed by meta gaming therefore the high level strategic game is toast for me and its now just blast in small ships for small gang combat i have to say i wish i had worked this out earlier but as i have a highly skilled character focussed on sub caps i did not waste effort training something big and shiny to have that meta gamed by certain people i am not too impactedthanks for all the fish but this is my last post on this thread i said what i needed to say and if people have a vested interest in not seeing this or dont get it then more fool them blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp

as you all know goonswarm has spread like a virus across eve online i dont claim to know the history of it but what i do see is a new face upon eve online when i returned to eve it was not the same universe that i had left behind its a new verse that is plagued by a powerful syndicate that has spread to the roots of every null sec corp the goons started when a corporation called band of brothers started using an exploit to amass a fleet and lag out players so bad that they couldnt activate their weapons undock or warp out when they needed to they were bent on dominating the game from the get go and built swarms of newbie ships to take out carriers the news announcement came that a new organization started to join the fight against band of brothers goonswarm federation had joined forces with iron to fight bob off using the same battletactics they formed massive swarm battles that lag up the server so bad that ccp had to fix the server nodesgoons now control 100 of the north their headquarters juowq and vfk are old sites that have outposts that predate player outposts these systems have perma level 5 industry and can be used to make an alliance strong with this region and 300 or better active players you could control the region well enough to defend it with 1000 people you could turn the tide of the game this region used to be populated by carebears who ruled it with an iron fist are you going to let goons take over the game they claim the game will go bankrupt and servers will close by december maybe they will succeed and get enough people to quit to shut down eve for good from what i heard the guy who runs it is a lawyer who wanted to sue the ccp these players all started right around the time of the plex the plex was new and that meant people could start alt accounts with isk they amassed from industry t2 bpos they bought plexes for prices like 250m being able to amass trial accounts and plex them meant that they could devise a master scheme to rule the eve universe it meant they could hack the eve servers and not have to worry about loosing their account because it was just a plex it meant they could be as rude and mean to people as they have many accounts and it doesnt matter the free to play plex changed the game it changed the people who play it as well today goonswarm is spread all across the map in null sec they rule the nullsec map carefully using infiltration and military tactics and psychological warfare they take wings of their corp mates and start corps for holding soverign space they then recruit and decieve a group of players into a corp under goon control if you want into a null sec corp then youve got to hand them your api the api is one of their best spy tools and in the hands of a goon your api is their weaponthe game breaker  goonswarm federation the goons are guarding the most profitable regions of the game they now have taken leadership roles in many of the null sec organizations and alliances they have installed so many alt accounts all over eve be warned the goons use real military style psychological warfare against the players of eve the style and type they use varies with the individual target the infiltrator  you may have them in your corperation or alliance playing for a leadership role already know what to look for a goon recruiter will troll away the good recruits while installing more swarm into your corp the sov breakera diplomat alliance or corp leader who is acting as a leader to keep a group of people busy theyll try to keep an alliance or corp thinking they dont need industry just pvp theyll get players to stay in their base and buy ships and break their bank before they get powerful enough to do some damage to defeat goons you need an alliance whose ready to supply between 200 and 500 ships including cruisers when you get enough people ready to skrimish in cruisers and frigates you can get people who fly bigger ships most of the older players get singled out  broken and shredded into nothing unless they can plex up different accounts to keep on the down low its rude to ask an old player for their api its also not as secure as they say it is someone checked my api without even leaving a single log a rich lawyer is someone who knows what real goons are like and they know how to get people who can hack computers and worse they can be dangerous people too the truth is i dont wanna see a corp like that ruling the game its got me flamed up something fierce so pardon me while i burst into flames i need 1000 ships to alter the course of the game so if youre still interested in playing then come rise above the rest go tickle syndicate in the west and youll see some of the best go to curse and youll see some of the worstthe north offers up the berth of the eve economy and it should be harnessed by the best people build up your connections dont let yourself be harassed let the goons burn for their actions

what also makes me laugh is that this bring sense to an old saying at least it is an old saying around my folksyour envy makes my successit doesnt matter if you dont want to be like the goons despise their methods or their being they wouldnt employ such methods or be at all if lots of people didnt liked their waysi see a lot of people complaining about what large groups can do and that has a reason you complain too much and that makes impossible for you to rise or join a large group

your corp name says it all dropping cans to cause people to decloak is an exploit has been an exploit since warping cloaked was installed into the game mechanics and that most likely was before you were even born
when i first came to asia i saw people driving and i thought to myself how this people can drive in this way it is chaotic to say the betterwhen i bought my car i tried to drive like we do in america that lead inexorably to fender benders to say the better loli then started to immerse myself in other aspects of the culture of the country without necessary links with driving itself and that made me realise why and how people drive the way they do and i understood how things workthe argument that you dont need to experience things to know about them always shows up and always amazes me because remind myself how many times i fell for its graspcommunities have always mechanics that are in place because of the colective ways despite any effort of one entity to change them this is one thing devs and players have to have in mind the game is not property of ccp the real life vehicles which support it are and the game is not made by players the dynamics in which it changes arethat is the main problem people cant see before they experience things there are ghost mechanics in every game the mechanics that take place not because devs put it there but because players will make them so no matter whatany change in the sov mechanics is just change in the way things are done not in the way things are and regardless of how they must be done they will soon get back to what they areas soon as there is no automatic way to do something there will be a market for people to take care of that as soon as data is not gathered by automatae there will be market for people to gather it and soon things are just the way they were beforethat is what experience makes you understand and observation added to theory fails to showalmost all things wrong in eve are wrong because people make them wrong not because the system is wrong
i understand what you are saying but eve is supposed to be about sandbox and player made emergent content thats not possible if the server prevents players from creative playwhen there is only a single method of doing something such as colonising space then the mechanics are to blamecurrently destroying anything owned by an alliance requires that you shoot it reinforce it wait for the thing to come out of reinforce meet up with the alerted alliance at the chosen time and fight them then destroy itthis happens because the server not the players alert the owner its 100 guaranteed and there is no player choice or way to play this part of the game differently throughout history we find stories of imaginative strategic moves won wars and battles against superior foes and often they are usually the most celebrated where tactics which were dynamic unexpected new and innovative were tried and succeeded if every battle was forewarned and everyone smaller had to line up like musketeers and duke it out like they do in eve then our history would be pretty bland and very much like it is in sov warfare in eve
so youre arguing for a change in mechanics you have never experienced in order to benefit a group of people you have never and will never be a part ofand you think lack of knowledge of the mechanics you are trying to change shouldnt count against you
point out where in the proposal i made there is any indication that i lack knowledge regarding the mechanic i suggested to be changedyou dont have to be an expert on every facet of sov to suggest that players should be the reporter of an attack rather than the server i spend a lot of time in null and conflict is beneficial to me as well as everyone else player made content and sandbox  server enforced content
again no arguments therean iliterate stating that 2 plus 2 equals 4 in decimal system is right despite who this person isa double nobel in math with doctorates and weekly papers published in math respected journals that states 2 plus 2 equals 5 in decimal system is wrong no matter whatyour experience expectations hopes or paradigms about the game are not arguments to sustain an idea you postulate in a discussion that is the main issuethere is no reason whatsoever that imply the need for such thing and despite the personal likes or dislikes there is no reasoning in your idea that is what it lacksi can see what this can be and i can see what it cant but regardless there is no needthe game needs is the colective of players not the needs of all players and that is the reason almost all suggestions are not implemented you have to think about the idea as a whoie not as what it can do for one side dismissing what it demands for other sides and what it changes for other sidesand the way this argument has been conducted by you is another reason for the sake of realism and immersion one entity must be one entity because people are almost always unable to follow strict ideas without emotional involvement and personal judgementif you know a honest industrialist is also a pirate that would most likely change what you consider from the industrialist andor the pirate if most people cant even discuss ideas in a forum other people are represented by their avatars and regardless having no idea who the person is still able to state things as if they were true what good it is to be able or obligated to have your personal identity as an ingame informationthis only leads to one outcome make things better for a few at the expense of making it worse for many
well that is your opinion and your simplistic and childish 2  2  4 example really does not cover the issue at all the reasoning i have come out with after my first two posts is clear and precise you however are refusing to see it most likely due to the fact that you have multiple scamming accounts and what i have proposed impacts you only ccp could really prove or disprove this as only they have the data and even then that data would have to be picked through processed and finally read your reply to me is on the basis of what you feel who is the many is the many all those people who run scam accounts then if so its really funnyas for benefitting the few and hurting the manythe current situation as is benefits a certain type of player the issue is that it adds to the imbalance around force projection i can quite understand why players who benefit from this would not want it ended it enables them to have fun and put forward their superiority with little risk and means that they dont have to grind at the moment it meets the classic definition of benefitting a few and worse for the many except perhaps that there are so many people doing this which is why my example of a fleet with 50 spies was so amusingdid i ever say give the real player name no i was after a designated main account in truth people who have an industry side and a pirate side would have no issue if joining a pirate corp its logical after all turn it around and his industrial toon joining a industry corp with a pirate main some corps may well accept him but if they saw that the recruit was in pl with another character and that the pirate corp was hot dropping they would of course think very hard about it at that point it comes back to them sorting it out between themyou seem to think naively that people can be trusted to role play in this game when the role playing side of this game is so limited and looked down on by most players thats so naive you should be blushing with embarrasment but you most probably cant even see that your entire argument is based around people being able to role play their toons in a game that very few people role play frankly your argument does not hold waterand should i mention that ncdot titan loss blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
what a truly interesting sentence and one which has no real meaning whatsoever apart from trying to define some sort of intellectural superiority its a gasses sentence which in reality is up in the cloudsin your opinion which you have not detailed in anyway shape or form this is convulated way of saying you are wrong with a sense of smug superiorty which is not earnt the reasoning is there but you are too far up yourself to see iti have defined the need in the first page of this thread eve is not dying but it is not growing either if you dont think that is a need then you have your head right up in the cloudsa truly arrogant sentence you assume incorrectly that this idea was not looked at in terms of the whole but lets follow your wishy washy statements and saying quite simply that i looked at this idea in terms of the impact across the whole gamethe way i have conducted this argument telling trolls to go away if they come out with arguments that are off the track or setup to divert attentionso what is an entity in eve in your opinion the player the account the character the corp the alliance or the coalition and just because my second post was emotional does not invalidate my proposal all it showed was that i cared better that then a dry fishi decided to pick this apart due to your posting on the sov change thread in which you and others get the op too admit to having little experience with sov warfare and then you use that to attack the person so that his idea is not valid because he has no experience and yet in this thread you say that experiences are not argumemnts to sustain an idea then why are you using it to say that having no experience invalidates an idea in that other threadedit i just noticed that your character was created 21st september 2013 which makes you all of 4 days old in this game that is why your posts are such banal general high level pap in fact i am rather amused that i missed that what a waste of time and effort replying to you as you obviously have no idea interesting setup you have there all our employees are family or sudokin one to another and that is sine qua non condition to join fascinating that why would you have a policy like that i wonder why and your war dec policy is very hs anyway i thought your portrait looked a bit bare so i added a little colour to it childish i know but someone did it to me for replying in local which i thought was funny so why not do the same as you stay docked and never get into combat that addition to your portrait will stay there for the rest of your time in eve enjoy blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp

no no no and nooh did i mentionno
the part where i pointed out to you about how ing godawful it would be if they took your suggestion to up the reinforce timer to 48 hours which was your original proposal which when pointed out to you you even edited if you had any clue about this had any significant experience or had ever even pretended to hold sov or rent from someone who does or been in any kind of large scale war you would never ever have made that suggestion that brought your inexperience into sharp reliefi even told it doesnt disqualify you from speaking on the topic though but it sure does when you continue beating your head against it while claiming false credentials by virtue of paying for a sub for a while yeah ive played on and off since launch too but i dont pretend to know jack about wormholes or planetary industry or capital ships or t2 manufacturing
yawn
exactly i mean i like the current concept of building titles but it always feels like half the things i add dont do anything unless i add even more and next thing you know the guy is a director just to perform a simple taskwhile an expansion that focuses on business would strengthen eve for ages to come i understand that people seem to feel that rebalancing the dominix only to undo the rebalance not even 3 months later is a better use of time and resources look at the moment id settle for a simple patch to at the very least do the following1 add tooltips to contracts2 make it so contracts assigned to corps can only be accepted by people with the contract manager permission3 make it so a pos can be set as a persons base instead of forcing us to give permissions toother facilities which has the side effect of they gain those at every base that is not hq or where they are based atprob gonna edit op to clean it up a bit thoughts were a touch unorganized but at least everyone seems to get the gist
it would be nice to have more people into the corporation thing but the push towards all the combat and content take the focus awayit would help if corporation management mechanics were to have a more present role in other aspects of eve but that also will be frowned upon by manyhowever it would be nice to have real business missions and not glorified courier missionscorporation management today is something only a couple people need among hundreds maybe thousands even if corporation management were to have a more central importance also in middle management then it would have more focusmaybe and this a big maybe unite under management category corporation sov and trade skills it would help to have some functionality added to cq or ship hangar more focused on management the aspects of market and corporation management that merge really added like stock markets or corporation values other than how many ships they kill or have destroyed stuff like thateven have into management conditions that change the other aspects like missions that are only available to corps that ceo has a given skill to a level or change the prices to wardec as much as the allies in the funcion of a corp management skilli myself see this from the point of view that i can have alts with trade and corp skills enough to do all that is possible without really having to dedicate a main account char to that goal at all that sounds to me like an underdeveloped aspect of the game for that reason alone
and only one person needs to be the kingpresidentdictator yet his actions affect millions your not seeing the big picture while we would be changing something only 5 or so of the players would ever seeuse it would affect the way permissions are distributed to 95 of players furthermore look at redblackblue frog an improvement to contracts and permissions would improve their business and therefore improve the ease at which the rest of eve could use their logistics service look at the big picture if you are able to make money easier then you have more money if you have more money you are more likely to buy more food from mcdonalds during lunch instead of packing some mac and cheese from the night before if youand by you i mean the average personbuy more from mcdonalds then mcdonalds has more money and a higher demand for their goods they then proceed to hire more employees and buy more food ingredients from various farms farmer joe can finally afford that new tractor with this increase in income his purchase funds the company that makes the tractors which allows them to hire more employees in addition his tractor will need fuel and service etc etcpoint is the easier it is to spend and receive money the faster it circulates the faster it circulates the stronger the economy the stronger the economy the better the financial state of the average person the better the financial state of the average person the happier they are also kind of on that same note of real missions rather than glorified courier missions subcontracting missions to other players might not be a bad idea if i could contract people to do my epic arcs and ten pay them a large cut of it wed both be happy  just an idea for a kind of contract
usually people dont like big picture posts so i go very careful with those but you seem like someone with no fear to readi see the big picture and i see what you mean and i see the problem the problemonce you have this kind of resource available in eve it stops being on the reach for everyone and stops even the illusion of that if people glorify the posts with one line and the quick joke over serious issues what to say about a situation in which the person is not only the ship and the fit flown the fleet the person is in or a colective of ships and fits but also the corporation they belong it adds a layer of complexity people are not kind to acceptthe most fearful situation to the status quo in eve is the situation where a person can have something as powerful as a weapon but it is not under the control of a math formula or a fit of the weeki see nothing wrong with dictatorship or general facism maybe because i am not north american and i know that it can work under certain circunstances and that is another fearful fact for people what if to rise a corp that on top of being as military and politically powerful has this power magnified by a regimen like lets say national socialist germany people fear that sort of thing and despite the existance of powers beyond the ships and equips the lack of corporative power still gives the illusion it does not have power what if this changes and corporation management skills become something to change tides in wars then you add something people are not likely to understand judge and followi see the beauty of such powers spreading and some armies destroyed even before undocking but eve crowd is not likely to accept that so fast
not adding anything new cleaning up the ui the contract manager permission does not allow management of contracts assigned to corp because everyone has the ability to do that this is stupid because there is no method for controlling who gets what kind of contract or who can touch what its crap liek that which leads to alliances with holding corps which is a bandaid for the problem it allows people to use the corp wallet to accept contracts which by having wallet access they could already do by simply withdrawing and then buying it with their the corps money the permissions in eve for corp management are redundant and  this is my second toon been playing since 2009 and i dont remember them ever being clean enough to make sense the current setup allows exploitation due to bad programming ccp is against exploiting bad programming want proof they posted a big threat about not sitting inside a forcefield with your drones assigned to someone else because ti took advantage of bad programming there is a clear difference between corporate espionage and taking advantage of a system that was broken to begin with also as far as dictatorships and structure go i dont care i just want the ability to choose my structure like ccp originally intended with their now faded dream of corp management i do not like being forced into one way or another all structures have their pros and cons there are advantages to dictatorships and advantages to democracies just as their are advantages to shield tanking and advantages to armor tanking their are advantages to everything in eve because it is all about choice except when it comes to corp management
ok its thursday whats up 
yep you are boned
i always like how people who know nothing about wars want to coral the fight into predetermined fixturesand the poster that posted this gemin this case i think war dec should be put aside altogether and leave it to a simple set said corp to low standing and let people go to areas where they can blow themselves up that solves a lot of problems and sure will make a lot of new players join the game and stay in the gamewow just wow i found my next target
i see the op has never heard of the watchlist
dracvladyou seriously put a bounty on this alt because111111 isk hahahaha
111k is not a significant value i know but this is about the kind of action not about how much is the value i would expect such actions afterall given the line of arguments you presented this or wardec would be eventually aroundwhat does that accomplish  that just accomplish here the dismissal of your argument as it shows the kind of things are to come in the game shows that my alt had someone bothering enough to put the bounty regardless of the lack of reason or ultimate outcome besides that stamp and for me it shows a lot of how your mind works besides that nothing changesthat is exactly why this idea of yours cannot help the community as a whole because of people with that kind of mindwhat good to your argument you think you do by placing bounties on my alts more to the point what you think that will happen  people will try to kill me for the bounty as with your idea there is a side you dont really understand for people who have no idea how the game works features like that are useless and for people who knows how the game works it is simply one more aspect to take advantage from those who dontyou may place a bounty on all my alts if you want and i activate one of my clones in a place no one is at a given time but before that i get my own alts there to collect the bounty you see what i mean  features linking accounts ingame are just ways to enhance the already advantageous position of a multiple entity holder nothing else it makes the disproportion of advantage from people with one account to people with multiple accounts greater and greater and if it is already a turn down for a lot of people imagine if you add one more powerful feature to benefit only the multiple account holders 
of course people wont kill you for 111111 but the nice big wanted sign on your portrait sure looks pretty doesnt it a player posting on a 5 day old toon who has no idea how the game works you are so funny and by the way you used the same second name on the ceo pretty obvious you assume that i have no idea how it works but once you think through what i just said you will notice that i put that small amount on you because i undrstood exactly what i was doing as i said childish but funnyspeaking of whichproving that you do not understand the mechanics of the game let me see you went outside and used another character to shoot your ibis and it went down by 0 and you are presuming to tell people how the game works anyway let me repeat what you said on your corp descriptionwhy would you do that come on spit it out even though gritted teeth its because you need to know the player and know you can trust them you may sporut rubbish here but your actions in game show what you really think heh anyway thank you that was so amusing oh and i wont war dec you because there is no point i prefer to pvp against people who are a challenge not a 5 day old station huggeranyway i am not responding to the rest of your rubbish it makes no sense your actions speak louder than your words here have a nice day blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
there is an old knowledge as old as ancient greece in oratory and argumentation techniques the scarecrow fallacy you employ misleading constructs to make in your words someone or something into what you need it to be to valid your argument and then attack that idea and not the real one that is what you have been doing in all your responses and actionsthanks btw i was wanting to test out the new bounty system to avoid doing what you and your protegee from the other topic are talking about something you dont know how it works or how it impacts the game as a whole now i know how the new rules of bounty work and i can know if people talking about it are talking serious issues or just garbage like the sov claims you so fiercy defendhere i am talking about you action of placing a bounty on my char because of a forum post i am talking about your argumentative ways and i am talking about the thoughts you might have had while formulating your arguments i am not talking about your person that is the difference when you talk about people you are not making an argument because talking about people is talking about feelings not factswhat it all boils down to is the way you think you are argumenting when you are not my corporation descriptions means that no one besides people of my familiy or considered as such takes part on that corporation it has nothing to do with trust it has to do with the fact that only my brother and a friend can put members in the corp i can trust anyone any extent and have this useless account link you speak of that wont allow other people to join this corporation what you said has nothing to do with what is written in my corp description you are misleading the meaning of the words to make your pointsecond account links have nothing to do with trust you can perfectly take steps to not link accounts you dont want linked whatever way it is used to make the link voluntary or otherwise if it becomes mandatory the ammount of effort it is placed to enforce this measure is the ammount of skill demanded from people to bypass it making it incresingly a discriminatory fact towards the less experienced less powerful or less effort employing playersthat is what you try to silently dismiss all the time you talk about trust and your actions placing bounty into a forum char talking about descriptions speaking one thing you say another just show how the meaning what is the idea of trust and honesty you holdyou may respond or not i really dont care because i dont come to forums and i dont log into the game to talk to one person about people or about personal things i am here exposing a idea not myself my idea is not about you or anyone is about the game as a whole and anyone who pick it up to respond or enhance i welcome it anything else i am prepared for otherwise i would be herethat is the whole problem with the way things were exposed in this post and the thing you dare not to talk about it is the game the community the general the anyone the mechanics and resources of the game are to any player all players and the conservation of the game when we start to put mechanics in place for one player a group of players you are inherently damaging the game for everyone that is what this and the sov idea i argument against have in common they are ideas to put something in place that has no effect over the thing they are being directed to but can be used to a miriad of other things that presently are doing fine or are not as damaged as they will be with that ideas in place statement to which you never address

yup people like one line answers always i have a couple then first semantics if you have something to tell you something without doubt it is not trust you get it is insurance you can fake the absense of link between accounts you dont want to so it is not a fail safe negative method for a number of reasons you can indeed fake relation between accounts not linked so no fail safe positive method also still no need for anything else than a mail or im to verify if an account does belong to the same persononly for that there is no reason to say this is a feature that takes precedence to any of the other garbage people ask in this foruns what to say about the genuine issuesi dont really need to write all that as you dont need to place bounties on my chars the thing i did is to show you how i there is not one drop of sense in placing that bounty and i cant see how a person can find the bounty or the word wanted in portrait funny i do had fun playing blowing alt frigates a couple times and wandering around with that bounty with people not even bothering to talk about that that i found particulary funi also had lots of fun showing that to people and throwing some picant jokes about the kind of people that does such a thingbeyond that nothing more than the 4 lines above to dismiss your opening
now that was a better answer in the thread i did try to say that it was not the complete answer due to reasons you have detailed here first of all people can get around it however this is the rub how many people will keep going to that effort and you were right it meant that less dedicated people would not be able to spy giving an advantage to those that had the isk and accounts to do so but remember that many lower level players cannot get into the higher echolons of the cfc or even get into pl ncdot etal they have to have a certain level to do so for pl they have to spend a long time in the training alliance but there is a risk to the high iskmultiple account players continued playing of the game if caught which had to be carefully weighed up by that old player could he risk losing those very old accounts with titans and supers it is not a complete insurance against this but it reduces the pure scale of this issue which makes the game harder which is what i enjoy also it requires effort on the part of ccp which going on past events like offensive names and botting is highly unlikely so while i had a blast at suggesting this as a way to deal with it i am not some sort of starry eyed fanatsist that thinks its the full deal far from it most things in life take effort and ccp are unlikely to do that unless they have statistics that give the ease of corp infiltration as the main reason for many people to leave and they get worried about the lack of growthabout the bounty that was only the second time i had ever applied a bounty and the first was on a player that was an fc and was designed to enable me to calculate the way it worked to be honest the notifications get a bit wearing after a while and understand that the bounty was placed on you to expose your lack of knowledge of the mechanics hence the comment about the big wanted sign taking up 15 of the picture i have seen numerous people get really upset about that and it does not bother me one bit but i said that as i wanted you to blow up a ship or two this is not a dig at you just an explanation of my actions yes it is childish i agree but this game allows us to be childish at times even though my use was hard and cold though it still made me laugh at one point i noticed that you are posting a lot on the forums well people dont war dec me because i am not tied to hs but you are the way you have set up to avoid them works and good luck to you and to your business too just be careful though commenting as you do as some people can get very vindictive in this game i do get the impression you are a returning player so you most probably understand thatas i said i have moved on from this i have changed my game objectives because of it before i wanted to carve out muy own sov in an alliance in which i was one of the leaders and had built up assets to do that but as this will not change i have changed focus which is now to have fun with those assets at an individual leveli wish you luck in the game and have fun blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
some points i always see people complaining about are sumus supra around hereyou have to keep in mind that it is not only the sub money that drives the financial force in eve and you are wrong to think that because you have a couple alts you are a mega funding source for ccp if ccp does its job they know that every human player is important not only in the function of how many alts paid but also how many plex bought and how many other people play because they play from the corporative point of view it is better to have at one moment 100 one account players than 20 5 account players reason being that the future player base expansion is a function of how many people are playing not how many accounts are being paid that invalidates the idea that the game have to in any way benefit people in the function of having alts they will terminate attracting a new crowd to the game intersted in other things is better than keeping people bearing multiple accounts just to mine afk or one man ganking armythen you have to think in the sense of engineering it is way better to the financial status to the game and to the general use and support that most of the players be casual players a player pays the same and not as much money as hours playing so it is financially more taxing to the system the player that pays x and play 10 hours a day than the player that pays the same x and play just 2 hours a day in some sense deppending on the player base it would be impossible to have all sub players playing at the same time there is no reason to assume that it is better for the game for ccp or for anything to priviledge players that keep logged all day in detriment to the players that log do some 2 hours of pew pew and log offadded to that is the infinite number of people that would love to play eve just as a sci fi second life you cannot say that it would be detrimental to the game because franky the dress up folks would pay for a better game for everyone and not interfere with the warfare and industry while spending hours molding and making up their chars in the creator that actually doesnt load the network as much even if there were station social interaction this could be done in an entirely different network that would not interfere with the so called serious playerbut despite all that people insist in think that because they are playing a long time have a lot of alts and spend half the day logged in eve the game must represent their interestsall the things mentioned as turn offs by people in the posts are either options people can avoid if they want or no interference with their desired gameplay or nothing but cosmetic changes but still people rise the straw man of the wowization of eve as if it were knocking our doors alreadywow itself could still be the epic game it were before all the panda and celestial  horse steed things the change that made it crap wasnt the things you could buy or the things you could do but the actual no change from what it was as far as gameplay goes to what it is nowgw2 is not becoming gring wars 2 because of gem store cosmetic itens or floral interface it is becoming grind wars because people want to be reconized by what they did more than what they doeve is becoming a boring game not because it is going towards the casual players it is becoming boring because players dont know what else to do with the freedom they are being given
tldr there is an opportunity to increase interaction between pve and cloaked ships there is an opportunity to increase active play vrs afk play covert cloaks needs a balanced this post has been edited to better reflect the subject matter and the discussion on the following threadsubject  interaction with cloaked pilots vrs pveissue UFFFD once a pilot is able to get into a system and cloak up there is no current in game mechanic to interact with that pilot as long as he remains cloaked there is no in game or out of game mechanic to know if the pilot is afk or at keyboardthere is no in game mechanic to know if the cloaked pilot has a cyno or notthere is no in game mechanic to properly assess the threat of force projection from the cloaked pilotthe pilot if they so choose can stay cloaked from down time to down time scope of this thread1  no change that would nerf cloak  i like them and use them 2  if someone is actively cloaked camping it is a non issue  the ability to hunt them would be more challenging 3  if someone is long term cloaking there is no mechanic to know if afk or not this present and unreasonable threat of force projection 4  cloaked vessels should have a mechanic that can be use the hunt them5 UFFFD current intel mechanics local chat does not give a proper representation of local intel a new system is neededthis thread is not intended to cover those who log off in a systemthere is only a small window of time to catch the cloaked pilot this is unreasonable for most pilots even the most diligent and prepared ones cannot interact with a cloaked pilot unless said pilot wants to this needs balancethe current mechanics allows the cloaky camper to abuse it in a way where the cost to effect if out of balancewith current mechanics there is no way one or many pilots can find and interact with the cloaked pilotthis threat of force projection encourages non active playwe should have a mechanic that allows in active pilots or those with cynos attached to be interacted with there are many arguments about pvp vrs cloaked that is not the in the scope of this thread pve vrs cloaked isif there was a reduction in threat projectionif pve ships and cloaky ships were presented a reasonable chance of success in combat without hot dropping this would increase interaction after much in game discussion and on this thread we have the following as best solutions1 cloak and cyno fitted together give a limit to time ship can stay cloaked or make it scannable keep in mind we already have and are getting new ships that will be cloaky and combat capable and will by pass this onecon if you make cloaked ships detectable without first requiring effort to become aware of initial presence you really do trivialize cloaksit might as well be a regular pvp ship or simply on a timerknowing the cloaked ship is not being ejected or scannable also makes it a known quantity for not having a cyno2 scan probe that can scan down cloaked objectsthis can have a large deviation factor whereas a pilot is active he can escape before getting landed onconcloaked vessels would gain a new weakness in exchange for no benefit3 ships fitted with cloak will be unable to fit a cyno UFFFD covert cynos would be okconthis makes system jammers redundant since they create much of the same effect really messes with legitimate capital transport too4 allow cloaked vessels the ability to passively target and cargoship scancon this might affect things a small degree outside sov null where they are not nbsi and dont run the moment a strange name appears in sov null the only ships to be scanned would be the pvp ships trying to kill the intruderfrom nikk narrell and i agreei would suggest something that increases chances for encountersthe only realistic approach is to give incentive for the evasive players to stand and fightunfortunately the 4 ideas listed above dont do this 1 and 2 make them easier to avoid while 3 kills cyno jammers4 is likely to make high sec more dangerous possibly low and npc null while sov null would not significantly be changednew5 if a contact is in your contacts list it should have a tag in local if that pilot is afk or not this is regardless of pilots location and would have different indicators depending on location in space would change once warp was initiated in station  im open on this one in summary we should have the ability to hunt cloaked ships even more so if they are not activeif you do not like any of the suggestions made please give a viable suggestion for a mechanic that allows pilots to hunt and or interact with a cloaked vessel once established in a system
first how are they denying you anything now please just look at the question how are they stopping you from doing anything second if they are not doing anything like touching you rubbing on you or anything elsewhat exactly are you defending against
fair questions if in null or low sec ratting or mining they are denying you if you are smart play time as you should not be out and about due to the possibility of getting dropped on by either caps or blopssecond invisible spies are bad enough but you should be able to defend against known spies or recon  cloaky camper who is gathering intel or as i put it denying you space by his mere presence i hope that helps elaborate a bit
i would argue that any truly afk player has never killed anyone which makes that not a problemand if hes not afk then he is legitimately hunting you in which case its no problemthe only problem comes from the reactions of people who dont want to have to be able to tell the difference or adjust for the possibilities of both it amounts to in my view sticking your fingers in your ears and yelling about how you shouldnt have to be listening in the first place
this contradicts your claim as they are afk and out of the house you can not hot drop from taco bell you can but that is usually afteralone in your misery gripping porcelain the only space he is denying is the space between your ears straight up it is another form pvp get creative slip a covert cyno on your jewboat go to the next system rat as you would have friends waiting drop cyno and trousers fap fap watching your buddies kill your little cloaky nemesis and friends donenext
you are largely not going to get sensible answers and this issue has been flogged to death there is actually a thread in the ideas forum where someone has attemped to keep that as the place to rage and yell at each other over this issuei am not interested in nerfing cloaks and while i could acept a log out after a certain time delay its not that important to me the key thing is that you set up to deal with being cloaky camped and i mean do not go and rent a 10 system rent multiple systems with lower true sec systems in other words have alternatives make sure you have plenty of belts to rat in in cheap ships then dealing with cloaky campers is fun but if you have gone all in with a 10 system and you have no options then you have to look at yourselfedit just notied your in the kadeshi you have other systems and are not renting just go to another system and do something else fun part is ifthey follow you you have a chance of killing them blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
everyone has some value to their answer as to be sensible to the comment or question however it is not up to some self appointed person or persons to discern what is sensible or not
trolls aside my point has been missed i am not saying i cannot adapt and if you read the post you will see that yes i can move to another system i am asking for balance yes you do not know is he there or is he not i am saying you should always treat them as if they are there that is the premis i guess i made things too complicated once again simply we have a cloaky in system he will not leave give me a mechanic to hunt him nothing more my apoligies for making my arguments too complex or lengthy to fully read or understand i value the feed back of those who have chosen to respond
it is not complicated really at all here is the deal the cloaky as it is cloaked can not pew pew we all know that we can not discern what the intentions are of the cloaky who know may have a man crush on someone in the systemwe can not tell whether or not the person is in fact behind the key boardif you want the ability to kill a claoky that can not attack in its cloaked state then you have to give the cloaky the ability to attack in its cloaked state then when you pop said cloaky due to being afkwhelp then they were afk if they are not afk then you will find out in a hurrythis satisfies you need to know if they are afk or not ability to hunt them down and the prospect of said afk cloaker pushing your  in when they are in deed behind the keyboard
while i apriciate your point if only it were that simple no i am not that stupid cloaky already has means avaialble to combat while cloaked yes they must un cloak to use but say i cyno into a system with my nyx i dont have one this is just an examplecloaky stays claoked i scan and see nothing i bring my support fleet in blops cyno cannot be seen except on grid i have scouts in surounding systems wiht no activity and local fills up my nyx is dead in that senrio bad on me next seniro i  you off bacause we took your space  i dont know you so this is just a stiuationyou plex and alt account you train a cloak and cynoyou let it die with a cyno on several times so that if anyone looks they know you can do a cynoyou go to system that i use  does not matter what for if could be a jump bridge route you log in cloaked at down time and stay in a safe cloaked up until the next down time you do this every day  30 days go by you still do this every day you do other things and check back now and again to see if somone is stupuid or decideds to risk it senerio one happens  bad on us just because you happend to be home and at your computer looking at that screen for that one small instant in timeor we do not use the system or move there is no way to find you or keep you from doing this revenge you have or lols or trolling abounds whatever it is not content for anyone but you that is not balance game play is all i am pointing out simple as this somone wants to camp a system i should have a way to hunt that person in a feasable amount of time like i stated in my orgional post sorry if i offend anyone i have a job i have a family i pay for my accounts i do not have all day every day just because you do yes i can move to another system i can do a lot of things the one thing i can not do is hunt you

ok first stop using the thing about i am not stupid i work i have a life etc etc we all do it does not make you special once you log in and make post or log into game all that crap is left at the door and every one is under the same rules and mechanics yeahi have lived in null for quite a while been through many iterations of internet space mechanics through the years and have been on the receiving end of nuetsreds in system and have been on the giving end of it alsonow i know for a fact and for years we all had intel channels and you were responsible to ask if system is clear or what not hard fast rules in nullif you get a report of nuetred in system and you jump anywayyou are to blame and accountable no one else by using the tools with in the game and reporting nuetsreds not jumping into system you have denied a km for that dude that might be there now the use of cloakies and such is a viable play style and very effective tactic this play style is still for some reason widely unknown and understood for the vast majority of the population you have tools and smarts you should have mates that you work withuse them introducing a mechanic to help the folk that can not be bothered to use the mechanics and tactics already in game is badmmmk
what
here is what i do if baaldor gives me leave to reply sarcif enemy using sbs to engage setup covert ops set to kill sbs webs and scrams have them cloak up ready to intervene job is to hold in place so they can be killedcheck the people in system check when they moved corps what time and go back and check if weekend find any links you can to that charcter and assess the kb for who is likely to be linked to them assess fully the system location and likely jump in spots have people check the eve map for cynos in systems they may used as mid point if you are dealing with solar and i assume you are then they have supers dotted around logged off and a network of cyno toons ready to log in to get them out from my prespective dealing with that means you have to go with a cyno gen as that is too much of a riskfor most black ops fleets setup two carriers have to have same defensive type have them fit for triage and tank and have them rat together now they have to bring in a really big blops gang to do that we did thios with razor and ratted with a red in system and he did not have enough to kill us up until they brought supers into the area then we stopped but that is where your cyno gen comes ini like cloaks as they are and do not feel they should be changed or any of the other things people have suggested including modules that decloak system wide cloaks make playing this game possible for a lot of people and while i feel your frustration it would be a bad move game ways to nerf cloaks the cloaks are in fact a balance at a higher level imoedit suggest you post in this thread
so after reading your wall of text i shall refer you to the first line where it saysworking as intendedyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
my only issue with the is the way the payout occurs unless you are in a ship of sufficient value the full payout doesnt occur and the bounty stays with you ex player puts 25m bounty on you maybe for no reason you go out of the station get podded no big deal podded once you lose clone and viola go on with your life not no monow the system is merely just another way to grief while afk because you dont even have to make an agressive move on someone to earn a bounty maybe you need that character making isk in an npc corp in empire so you can support your pvpthe current system really is just a way to get around war dex and characters in noob corps obviously this is something pvprs must have cried about to get changed boo hoo i cant act my anger issues out on x because they are in noob corpbottom line you get podded once bounty should be paid out you shouldnt have to lose 25m isk or more worth of crap because someone cries you cornered their market in jita and you shouldnt have to be podded 612 times before you lose that bounty did billy the kid get killed 12 times before the bounty got paid outjust stupid all this does is force people to use more alts which isnt a big deal when you have 3 accounts whatever the pvprs cry more in this game than the high sec carebears ffs i fully expect to see this get whacked with a nerfbat at some point because its asinine happy flying 
ignoring the obvious butthurt in this postsuch a system would be invariably used for rmt andor exploits which in fact is precisely why the current system exists as it does suppose for example that you really hate me and put a 1 billion isk bounty on my head with your system do you know what i am going to do i am going to pod myself with my own alt give myself the money then send you a mail with my own killmail thanking you for the isk that and player freedom is more important than hurt feelings dont like what i have to say on the forums put a bounty on my head i care not
oh yeah and since im at work i will have to add a bounty to you later i hesitated at first when i saw you were in an npc corp because you might have been a posting alt but it said your employment history for that corp was 6 yearsso now i have no problem giving you a hefty bounty once i get back home from work the major issue i have with it is that i cant give you a bounty straight through the forum system thats what we all need to be talking about a bounty button needs to be added to the forums id happily even pay a tax on the bounty amount to be able to do so
oh so in other words you are one of the butthurt pvprs and are cool with the system because you can exploit it in your favoryou point out a potential exploit yet you refuse to see the exploit on the opposite side of the fence yeah that makes senseno sweat the way around this is to start putting bounties on every noob in the game before too long theyll be meaningless or the noobies will cry because they can never get ahead on isksounds fun doesnt it
hey no problem jack i can give you one as well i havent played for 6 years but the isk is piling up and itching to get dumped on someone might as well be an upstanding eve citizen like yourselfi hope you can compete with the bounties a t2 bpo lets you put on someone have a nice day
so you even admit that your way would be open to massive exploits but you would still prefer it why i mean what is the exploit with the current system aside from people getting upset over having the wanted sticker on their poster really tell me how is the current system exploited it was intended to let anyone put a bounty on anyone else for any reason so whats the exploit please do so i pride myself on my nefariousness a higher bounty is just more fear i can engender in others make it a billion if you have the money thatd get me some damn good stature with my buddies
just gave you 30m isk bounty to start if you cry enough i wont put more on you otherwise i hope you got a lot of altsill let you figure out if the current system feels like an exploit
more please i have like ten alts for starters and that doesnt even equal my highest bounty i mean is 30 million all that a t2 bpo can muster i assure you however that you could empty your wallet and i would not cry the current system to me feels realistic in the context that we are all functionally demigods i mean yeah in real life you get the full bounty if you bring back enough of the head which for some history is where the concept of the double tap came from but then again we arent guaranteed to be reborn a few minutes later in real life either
since you cried so much i made the bounty ten times my first offer does that work for you we can do more if needed why dont you list all your alts and let the public see how much sack you really have id be happy to drop that much on each of them
for reference ladies and gentlemen he did actually put a 300 mil bounty on my head all of this for merely saying i was going to put a bounty on him when i got home from workapparently this is grievously offensive and disrespectful by the way and for some slight goading over evemails this guy is a gem folks considering reposting this in cp just for the righteous outrage at the inevitable results i went ahead and put 666666 isk on his head though wouldnt anyone to confuse him for a wuss who cant back up what he says after all
i love how people cry exploit when they dont agree with a game mechanicoh and im a little jealous now kaarous your bounty is higher than mine destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
heh i please to aim im just wondering how much more isk it will cost him to realize that bounties are a point of pride amongst those who walk the left hand path

hey if you have not noticed yet once you log in you are consenting to pvp in other words any one logging is a pvprby logging in and paying for your game time you are accepting the rules and conditions of the game there is no exploit if everyone is under the same rules and conditions as everyone else being a special snowflake does not give you a pass either here on the forums or in game enjoy your day and give me your stuff you are doing it wrong any way
many good ideas this is a topic that has been brought up and over looked for a long time changes to corp permissions and roleschanges to wallet accessit is an interwoven mess to add you should be able to pay out salary to members maybe add a role that lets you set an amount for each role and when you pay it auto figure  well ok that may be too complicated something better than shares if you give everyone one share so you can give out paychecks they get every mail involving a vote and directors  ceo are the only ones who really need it having a vice ceo or a chairman role would be nice as well
love the idea adding to original postedit never mind the original post has reach maximum allowed characters still an amazing idea
its so simple but epic so hear its isremove all mining crystals in game fro strip miner 2 keep skills for rorqual polite onlyno need to train them up more than one account just the one that needs itand to conclude more miners more or on market better use of skills enjoy
highlighted the bit that caught my eye i dont see how this particular part is a bad thing think about it miners needing combat and or logistic support creates demand for said support yes guarding miners is about as boring as watching paint dry so is mining however it also add sophistication and a little diversity to your mining ops adding ewar guards and some scouts to the equation makes your little belt run more than just a bunch of livestock lining up at the local watering hole if your corpies cant hack it hire some mercs plus this idea your idea by the way encourages interaction with other players in the game and reinforces the whole mm part of mmo
i will not echo a lot of what has been said already i am an industrialist i have had my issues with gankersi learned some harsh lessons i gained value from those lessons gank encourages active play and interaction with others

there are many disingenuous statements in the op which doesnt help his case tbhlet me start by saying that i agree that some may be affected by those afk and cloaked so with that in mind would the op please answer me thiswhilst they are cloaked and afk which game mechanic are they using to interact with youthen please answer thiswhy are you not asking for that mechanic to be nerfeddestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
go back to sleep and stay on your porch you have not even the fundamental understanding of the argument here
to the first the cloaking mechanic is the one being used it is possible to log in right after down time hit cloak and stay cloaked until the next down time whilst doing noting to your second questoni have made several suggestions 3 are perceived as nerfs to cloaking the fourth is an added mechanic to allow non cloaked or cloaked pilots the ability to interact with cloaked pilots
the other side already have the same privilege put your afk cloaker alt in their ratting systemsor go somewhere elseor rat in groupsor rat in cheap ships
yeah but that takes effort and some sort of active reasoning
possibility of getting dropped on  cloaker not afkgathering intel  cloaker not afkonce again a nullbear wants to nerf all cloakes under the premis of afk is bad to make zero security space safer for himselfjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
i like the over all premise of the op some of the concerns voiced are legit some im sure is coalition for cowards trollingnow to maybe improve on the op idea make the timer for subcaps so bridges are more for tactical positioning of subcap fleets instead of a way to blob some one caps would not have this timer and my logic for that is if you drop a cap fleet on a sub cap fleet it will take much longer for cap pilots to target the sub caps at this point im theory crafting seeing as i have yet to use a cap in a fightnow i would say cut the targeting timer for sub caps to about 30 seconds
why do defenders and above all supercapitals need such a tremendous buff
agree or if ccp doesnt want us to completely cut off mercs they could allows us an option to blink on only for capsuleers

but if then we ok im lostdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless

realy all the change is making strip miner 1 and 2 like ice miner 1 and 2there for no need to train the skills on all accountstime safed on training mining politlsand only needing the skills for rorqual since you dont need the skills for refining

i think the big issue is ccps active encouragement of players using multiple accounts i run a multi screen rig so i could sit in a grav site 100 off and just watch for a target while running missions in hs that toon is both afk and manned at the same time i completely endorse a high sp skill set to scan down cloaked ships that way a player who is cloaked at least needs to watch d scan which is at least is a form of playing i really think that scan probes whose whole job is to scan down cloaky ships would be a fair comprimise
i expect to get trolled bad for this one but how about this the efficiency of a cloak with a cyno onboard is affected so that it will give a top skilled scanner the ability to scan it down within 20 km using special probes blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
ok so once again looking at several responses this post has received i am beginning to doubt my ability to write clearly or most likely those who read these forums reading comprehension rate is to be abhorred1  i do not want to change or nerf cloaky  i like them and use them 2  if someone is actively cloaky camping non issue  i just want the ability to hunt them 3  if someone is afk cloaking a  gives the impression of active cloaky camper b  is very hard to discern from an active cloaky camper c  should have a mechanic that i can use the hunt them d  should have a mechanic that decloaks after a long period of inactivitythis is not a proposed nerf to cloakingthis would be added mechanic to allow active game play and induce conflictcurrently when someone cloaky camps a system yes people leave or stay dockedthat does not encourage content having a mechanic that would allow me to hunt cloaked ships would i did not say make it easyi did not cry about i can do nothing as yes i can leave and go somewhere elseand as far as null bearing it what part of wanting to hunt cloaked ships gives the impression of bearnesswe should have the ability to hunt cloaked ships even more so if they are not active
you already docatch them at gatesset trapsjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
but i asked which game mechanic they are using to interact the whole point of a cloak is to stop interaction on both sides so no its not the cloakyour answer to my second question actually busts your first because of thatso which mechanic is it and why are you not asking to nerf that oh and any change that reduces the cloaks ability is a nerfdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
sorry i cant fix stupid and as coy and cute as some responses attempt to be they are well still stupid so respectfully i incline to disagree if i enter a system and someone is there cloaked and remains so for more than an hour i should have an option to interact with said person and not just leave systemsorry if that pisses in your cheerios by denying you the ability to sit with a an alt cloaked in a system to extort isk from the locals

i understand your frustration and also your irritation with people coming up with the responses that they do mags and i have had an exchange on this subject before and all he wants to do is remove local which seems to make sense to him and others i replied to them that this was stupid due to game balance issues based around cyno delivered force projection they disagree and in fact i see their point in that if someone is watching local and gets aligned they are impossible to catch but there are gaps which is why you see many people getting ganked with the changes to interceptors in terms of bubbles and the warp speed acceleration i forsee more people getting caught which hopefully will reduce the number of people who do afk cloaking if what they say is true that afk cloaky camping is due to the inability to catch someone due to local then logically there will be a reduction i await that possibility with interestanother thing they mention from their side of the equation people go afk sitting in stations and at poss and i can see their point on that but they are doing it not to intereact with someone more to do with not bothering to log off but it again has an interaction in that the person coming in system to engage has no idea if they are active or not i know that myself as i have recently started campingone time i tried to explain the data supplied by the map and on dotlan made it very easy for people to vector on to active people especially now with dotlan doing a npc kill delta check it out i am using it my point being that if they remove local then remove all of that this was ignored by all and what was amusing was one chap who i rather like who mines did not see any issue in keeping that data as it did not affect him however his killing of npc ships in belts would get noticed and of course the industry indexon balance i have had less impact from cloaky campers because i can play when i want i am retired and as a result i can pick and chose when i rat which makes me an immensely irritating target again another reason why i dont get war deccedi do wish that the other side of this argument would be a bit less smug at times a prime example is baalldor above but sometimes you have to get into their head to see what their reasons are i hope you can see that even though they can be a bit crass they do have some issues to be blunt like they have with you they have at times got up my nose because they also seek to shut you up by replying in such a way to make you lose your temper i like many have fallen for that too but they have at times been fun to spar with especially when they can be seen to be hyprocrites on this subject however that still does not help you at the end of the day however i look at that person who is afk cloaky camping withoujt any attempt to kill anything as being lame i have killed some my favourite was a goon tengu which i baited in a badger mk ii but then again he was actually killing things noctis and industrials and this is the key to it you have to act in such a way that they have to do something to prove that they are there and able to impact you there are various strategies to do that as you are aware that being said if they have camped your system for weeks and done nothing then they are truly lame as players and if he is one of those please email me privately with his name perhaps a good idea will be to create a database of these types of lame afk cloaky characters so other people can share the details of their activities so that we can work out whether they are linked to someone with capabilities or not blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
how is any of this a supercap buff
delete cynosproblem solved
if you go and drop a big pile of dreadstitanswhatever onto a lone super or even a fleet of them itthey have a full minute to jump out before you can actually engage how is here is a free sixty second bug out timer not a buff
there is a better answer to this problem up the pgcpu of exhumers and add 2 mid slots to them so an better tanks can be fitted the core issue is that a t1 half ass fit ship can solo gank a t2 ship
first my sincere apologies for anyone who has brought valid arguments to this discussion and actually read what this post is about i was not referring to your responses as stupid assumption makes an ass out of everyoneif cloaky campers were active and moving about yes it is possible to catch them at gates or bait themhowever when they are only semi active and log in before you do and then never decloak those are a little more difficult to trap bait or catch difficult as in impossible those are the ones i wish to hunt the ones that never decloak the cost and effort between the cost of disruption and the ability to perform disruption is out of balance one person on one usually plexed account can disrupt a system from use for multiple people using multiple accounts if that person so chooses to not decloak there is no avenue to combat it or remove the person from systemthis is not just limited to ratters and miners it can depending on the system disrupt trade travel and a host of other activities no one against the ideas that have been posted on this thread has given an existing method to deal with a cloaky camper that has established himherself in a system and refuses to decloak in game discussion with other pilots and some on there have the following as best solutions1 cloak and cyno fitted together give a limit to time ship can stay cloaked or make it scannable keep in mind we already have and are getting new ships that will be cloaky and combat capable and will by pass this one2 scan probe that can scan down cloaked objectsthis can have a large deviation factor whereas a pilot is active he can escape before getting landed on3 cloaks can be cap hungry to where no possible fit will allow a ship to remain cloaked for more than one hourthis would be an actual nerf and very hard to implement and as such is not one of my personal picks4 anyone in space whose ship does not perform some active function for more than one hour logs off this can give several warnings such as we get for the approach of down time it will affect everyone and not just cloaked pilotsactions can be as simple as moving stuff from cans to cargo bay or as in rorqual or supers moving from one bay to anotherin cloaked ships it could be as simple as changing speed or turning every other mmo i have or currently do play has a limit to inactive time spent in game i like this one as it forces pilots to be active in the game and not afkpersonally i prefer 2 and 4if you do not like these solution please post a response with a valid workable solution to cloaked campers who do not decloakedit to 4  the new crest api tools will eliminate the need to have a pilot logged in to get market data also i did not include docked pilots only pilots in space and for clarification only the pilot that has been inactive for an hour
the conflict we are seeing is due to the fact you have two camps you have the ones that play the game and work with in the mechanics and game play and the ones that do not like the game play and mechanicsUFFFD and try to change them through means of technical proposals the crowd that plays within the system already thrives and understands the mechanics will explain in terms of practical game play and experience less technical more experienced they also believe that this what they pay to play and this is how they like to play a game with the play style and mechanics already in placethe crowd that does not thrive under the current game play and mechanics want to change it with mechanics and forgoes the acquisition of experience more technical but less experienced they too also pay for this game but they have a different view on how it should be played and due to the fact they pay money to play it should be changed to suit their game play
i cannot speak for others but i personally do not want local removed how you thought that is a little puzzling as i have said i like the status quo many timesapology acceptedthe answer to the first question i posed is local the reason i asked the question was to try and have you look at your issue from another angle one that took into account all the mechanics being used at the moment youre fixing the effect without looking at the causenow to your ideas1 this would be a nerf to active play which i believe is not your issue2 scan probes would also affect active play as you would have insight on intel gathering this include watching stations as well as getting into position for a warp in also with a large deviation catching someone cloaked and moving would be a problem3 cloaks are already balanced in regards to fitting but yet again this would nerf active play which i believe you are against4 log off mechanics are bad in 2 ways firstly they are easy to counter without breaking the eulasecondly you failed to ask yourself whether ccp actually want this the reason i believe they would not is simple we all play on a single shard and the more players online the better for ccp in fact i would go as far as saying those afk are actually great for ccp low load numbers are not to be sniffed atnow as i have said many times i like how things are right now but if you wish to remove afk cloaking then local must be a part of that change this means a decoupling of intel from it and replacing intel gathering with another system this would be as part of a package and that package would also include ways to either hunt cloakers or a nerf to their abilities in other waysdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
this is an insight that i have not considered i would find this acceptable as long as the new way of getting intel was as efficient is as local one way to do this is by concord transponders all ships fitted with a pod have them as that is how concord tracks allows gate access ect what do you think if the current d scan mechanic that scans the system gives you pilot transponders in system this would not give ship types or location just the pilot in system to update this information you would have to re scan with a system like that then you could have local chat where only those who spoke showed in local chat we could then include a scan mechanic that tracked the transponders cloaked or not allowing to scan ships down by this method it would still be difficult by sig radius and wot not to track a moving ship cloaked or not as it is now with un cloaked ships however a stationary target would be found i am just shooting from the hip here but this could answer several proposals the vigilant should not have issue as the only change would be to tap de scan every so often to get an up date the down side is it would take more that scouts would have to be more active i do not have a problem with this although i know this may be troll fodder for thinking so
two words win amp
come on ccp  this is an easy onehrolt ceo live free die proud
ccp has already declared they are adding twitch a 3rd party program to eve in the upcoming rubicon expansion so why not add everadiocom by adding a player run radio station to the game you would only be furthering the plan to put more into the hands of the players and less in the hands of the npcs think of the implications advertising for various corps could be done by paying of djs with good time slots and a good fan base newsinformation would be more readily available things said on the media could cause political nightmares just like in real life they have been supporting eve for ages and adding them to the in game code would greatly increase their audience which might also increase their dj count and the quality of their djs not to mention it would also make their bills more affordable disclaimer i do not represent everadio in any way shape or form i just think it would be cool if they integrated it while they are integrating other 3rd party softwarewebsites
there are of course hundreds of points i could make about how this will never happen but in short1 eve radio and twitch are very different things twitch for example is forprofit whereas eve radio if im not mistaken is nonprofit2 content licensing for streaming eve online on twitch is pretty much nonexistent streaming music content via eve radio through the client would be a legal nightmare3 the jukebox was removed deal with it4 twitch utilizes datacenters in multiple regions for streaming eve radio from what i know does not5 streaming to twitch is not the same as streaming music from eve radio integrating the streaming of directx rendered eve content to twitchs services is completely different from integrating an audio stream alongside this twitch is likely providing some degree of support to ccp for the client integration something eve radio would likely not be able to do as eve radio does not code nor create the applications that perform the bulk of the backend work of their servicethe list goes onso no this is a bad proposal
