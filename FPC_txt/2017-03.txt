jintaan president 
live reddit ama right now
im supposed to be on a train to clapham junction so
this is a very quickfire reply loreleiyour name
reminds me of a boattrip along the rhine many many
years ago with school friends great timesill pick up
your references on my return later today but thanks
for expanding a bit on your position it was helpful
thanks also for listening to the recordings i
appreciate your respect for playergenerated
contentcatch you later
i looked at your concord wish list lorelei  thanks for
the linksuicide ganking  whether of retrievers or
charons  is a very exact science or should be you
do seem to understand the mechanics behind the
playstyle and thus i credit you with far more nous
than the average highsec carebearour basic aim is
to maintain the presence of nonconsensual
aggression in highsec and as i said previously to
provide both the ganker and the person ganked with
adequate tools for attack and defenceconcord is
naturally an important factor in our calculations
because upon their behaviour is based our ability to
remove barges efficiently obviously we dont succeed
at every attempt ive been thwarted many times and
that is why my initial reaction was that there really
wasnt very much wrong with the mechanics of
gankingit seems that your suggestion is more about
making the encounter less predictable  for both
sides i imagineconcord response behaviour is
certainly predictable which enables us to plan our
ganks with some degree of precision naturally
introducing a random element as you suggest would
affect that but im not sure what actual benefits
would be offered to the miners or to the gankers if
the outcome of a suicide gank became less certain
because of the risk of concord turning up before our
blasters had finished their work most of us would
simply bring 2 instead of one ganker some of my
comrades already do this to be sure of snagging the
pod in effect the change would be neutralised as
soon as possible there would thus be no real benefit
to the miner who would get ganked anyway  if not at
his keyboard paying attention etcintroducing a
random element into an activity usually does make it
more interesting but our business is not that kind of
activity we dont like the faction police though if you
could suggest something about getting rid of them
that would be interestingthanks again lorelei ill
continue looking down the list but realistically unless
someone from our own community steps forward our
point of view may be aired but couldnt be pushed i
guess thats why so many new order members vote
for other supporters of our very distinctive playstyle
its impossible to have an effective highsec
representative because of the broad scope i
mentioned in my previous post perhaps playstyles
should be represented in addition to regions but
then i fear the bill for trips to iceland might break into
ccps bottom line
thanks for taking the time to read what i wrotethank
you in my first campaign thread there was some
discussion with admiral root about ganking and i
even tried it out a couple of times to see how it
worked the poor victims got more than reimbursed
by me and are still on my zkillboard to seeless
predictable for both sides and also to feel like it
makes more sense and of course after a big
freighter gank there are many concord ships floating
around that cause even more lag for someone
playing on a lowend box like mine lag is not fun so i
am not just talking to stir things up but also to
improve the new eden experience for people like me
i am quite sure that the gankers will more quickly
adapt to any changes than the gankees but that is
the way of the carebear that is how we
areinteresting but there is already the chance to buy
tags and turn them in or rat them sure it costs
andor takes time but it is there to be taken
advantage of not sure how much sense it makes to
have to go to a station and turn the tags in but
concord need their blood money bit like with wardec
fees thank you for taking the time to at least read
what i was writingbtw i actually found mikes post
about the nature of the csm encouraging maybe
there is hope for the future after all
vote lillik e for csmxii lets gender balance eve online
and wspace
1 from mequestionhow would you like to see pvp
balanced   broad question i know but still 
broad indeed theres too many different types of pvp
in eve to answer that easilyyou have the pvper who
goes out looking for easy gankshulks then spams
the crap out of local when you fight back  camp him
inyou have the pvpers that will come and wait while
you form up a fleet to fight them which is the gf type
of fights i likeyou have the n1 type of fighting which
usually take hours of soul crushing lag to get
throughyou have the were leet pvpers who spend
2b per ship and cannot be countered without a
bloband finally you have the brute force supercaps
are us groupyes theres also station games  highsec
wars lowsec brawls logoff traps npsi fleets
gatecamps stream roams blops whs and troll
fleetsso if you can be a little more specific i will try to
answer but it will all come down to trying to maintain
the balance between all types of combat without
making one particular ship svipul orthrus the only
ship to use
i think the overall isk payout isnt too bad for c4 sites
personally my biggest suggestion would be to reduce
the spawn ranges of the waves in order to make the
site more compact this allows for less transit time
and can reduce the amount of time running sites by a
reasonable amount i do know people who claim to
be able to farm c4s to make isk at nearly or
equivalent to running c5 sites though personally im
not aware of this because most of my farming if i
can be bothered to do it these days was done
running c5 sites i would think maximum iskhr would
be done with 2 rattlesnakes with micro jonn drives in
order to be able to position correctly for each spawn
though depending on times to kill waves potentially
marauders could handle this better with the
reduction on cooldown timers that they receive for
mjdsi also dont really see c4s as being at a
disadvantage too much simply because with static
4s theres access to a lot of lower class pvp with
small wormhole groups something that c5 space is
lacking historically speaking c2 wormholes really
function as a gateway into the rest of wormhole
space to be honest they provide easy access to
kspace while providing the ability to dive deep as
they are theyre honestly mostly fine in my opinion
the isk per hour may be a little bit low compared to
higher class wormholes definitely but its also then an
incentive to move up the only real thing i would
suggest doing is a combination of 2 things1 give all
sites active or not a 14 day timer and when that
time limit is reached they despawn and come back
somewhere else this will help prevent clumping in
whs and distribute isk a little bit easier2 i would up
the amount as in actual number not isk value of c2
sites in order to make sure theres a good amount to
be run relatively easily while this wont fix the iskhr
itll give more pve content that will help players
outthe way wormholes stand at this point c1 and c3
class are definitely oriented towards industrial corps
c2s act as training wheels to handle higher class
wormholes c4s tend to be where small to midgang
pvp groups or larger lowend pve groups tend to
gravitate there are exceptions depending on
staticseffects of course c5s are where the big
groups reside and c6s are for farming
spacepersonally i feel like we need to change that
up a bit i see c1c3 space being pretty reasonable as
is where as c4 needs some care and consideration
for isk making and c5 space is fine but c6 space
needs a lot of work i appreciate you bringing forward
these concerns and if you have more questions about
it id love to answer them more in depth during my
ustz ama which im planning for this weekend
depending on real life scheduling conflicts
with any luck this weekend ill do a usearly autz ama
as well for those who dont fit well into those
timezones i do apologize but i would be more than
happy to field your questions either through in game
mail or perhaps a discord chattext

pve shouldnUFFFDt be this ded UFFFD
power back to the playerswhen i started playing the
pirate hulls and deadspace loot which came from
deds was big business living in syndicate the sites
were more than static rats waiting to be farmed
UFFFD they were contested and fought over by
the lean starving residents of npc null as some of
their only income some of my best memories that got
me hooked were of fighting over these sites
UFFFD a fundamental departure from the
skinnerbox raids of the other mmos i played the
npcs were not the main course they were merely a
pretext to player interaction the deds of old are in
every way possible a great model of how eve pve
should work scarcity and competition should
bottleneck some classes of pve to spur content and
shape certain economiesletUFFFDs talk about
scarcity if you are in sov thereUFFFDs no
reason to defend your anomaly as there are an
unlimited supply and you can just dock up until the
danger goes away if you are doing fw likewise as a
farmer you can just find another system and there
will be many more plexes than there needs to be
deds used to be different UFFFD there was such
a limited supply that they became worth fighting over
and the loot valuable now the idea is laughable
UFFFD loot is so devalued that even a max
payout drop isnUFFFDt worth a ship loss eve at
itUFFFDs core is about getting people to interact
and the former value of these sites promoted that as
attackers and defenders both had something worth
interacting over UFFFD big moneynow
letUFFFDs talk about competition after the great
escalation changes accompanying aegissov sov null
was producing so many deds and producing them so
deep in guarded space that the prices of all loot
tanked one could say the opportunity cost of running
them in npc null became nonviable given how easily
and safely one could factory farm them deep in sov
soon there was no reason to run them out of sov and
both content seeds and income was plucked from
npc null i mean you could ostensibly say that there
are moons in npc null yes of course there are but
these generally end up in control of larger stronger
neighboring sov style alliances wrestled from the
smaller scrappier npc null residents smaller entities
would like more active income they can actually
struggle for like deds rather than the game of sov
come to npc null in the form of postimer contentthe
current sov model does well to support larger entities
UFFFD they can feed their members by
developing the systems and moons just fine highsec
has incursions and industry which are both madly
lucrative given the relative lack of risk lowsec has
faction warfare and l5 missions npc null haswell
nothing that can be used to empower smaller groups
to let small groups build up to give entities other than
the few large monolithic entities a foot hold in a very
dogeatdog world they need bottom up accessible
income what do i mean by that the income source
needs to be something that does not require large
build up or investment from preexisting entities
infrastructures or npc standings UFFFD
something that cannot be essentially used as ransom
or payment by the people that already
UFFFDhaveUFFFD it needs to be
accessible ie anyone can do it the perfect fit for
both of these while encouraging smaller group
content is deds the deds 710 should be moved to
npc nullsec exclusively if larger entities wanted to
control these resources it would take considerable
active effort rather than the sterile timer based
flexing of large coalition musculature the intended
result is to give some of the keys of content and
group building back to smaller entities and give them
unique resources which are impractical for larger
entities to try and control given their scale and focus
if escalations are to remain they should only escalate
into npc space and the escalation should become
scannable after a set timelikewise this would reign
in some of the absurdity with the current pirate
battleship supply issues they would slowly return to
being rare to being special it would shift a little bit of
the income to other stewards of content to the small
entities some people do not find their eveself in a
massive coalition who they are and what they do in
new eden is requires them to live a dangerous life on
the edge with a few of their friends there has been a
lot of development on content ratchets for larger big
ticket entities itUFFFDs about time they give a
resource that can be contested on a smaller scale
while simultaneously fixing part of a large scale over
supply problem every space every playstyle should
have the appropriate tools and income opportunity to
support itself UFFFD npc null is a place so many
people want to be able to live yet has less actual
support than lowsec in my appraisaltldr move ded 7
through 10 to npc nullsec exclusive sites
simultaneously address the supply issues with pirate
battleship hulls while adding a niche economy for an
underdeveloped
i remember the days part when
                         of space
                               a small group could live in
npc null and keep their people in ships just from the
ded sites around them i t would be great if it was an
option again

ayudar mucho a la comunidad de habla hispana
pueda entender mas rapido el juego al inicio en mi
experiencia en particular fue de mucho provecho
haber conocido tantos jugadores que tuvieron la

muchos de ellos son jugadores de habla son de

for you support juvenius i feel ccp can help to make
more understanding this game for all players
beningers spanish speakers my experience was so
greatful because i meet incredible players they help
me alot to understand eve many of them are english
and im so greatfull of they
my playform is based on a few simple things 1 all
players need to be represented not just the mega
blocks and well known players in eve even the solo
gamer that just logs in and spends there time solo
just discovering the game should have a voice 2
even the smallest idea or complaint should be able to
be heard by ccp not just the major issues in game 3
i believe that the long standing bugs need to be
worked on we all want new features but i also think
that the older bugs and issues that persist in game
should finally be addressed 4 i think corp roles need
to be reworked ive always thought the roles were not
user friendly enough and we need better options on
assigning roles 5 corp logos need to be reworked
there should be a edit feature or upload like with
alliance logos a corp logo should be able to truly
represent what the corps about 6 motherships ccp
took them and called them super carriers but one day
motherships would be revisited 7 i also feel fatique
needs a rework too while im all for limiting power
projection i think jump fatique still needs some
tweeks yes

eve csm cadidate page
original line from my narrativeincrease the risk in
pve dread anoms titan anoms make it a
challengecomment from redditit will just widen a
gap between vets and newbros people able to fly
dreads let alone titans have means to make isk that
are unthinkableunavailable to new people already i
fail to see how it would make eve a better gamemy
responseso this is a fair statement and one that was
even brought up by some of my corp mates hang
with me on thisthe same could be said for skill
points the longer the game is around the more skill
point gap appears thats the method by which ccp
has chosen to separate access to contentthe game
needs to improve for everyone improvements for
new bros shouldnt be viewed from a veterans
perspective and there surely should be some
improvements when we look at improving the game
for veterans we cant view those changes from the
new bro prospective the improvements made for
veterans are naturally unavailable to new bros and
they should be unavailable to them heres whythe
way many games exist now is reflected of an upper
limit mindset in game design get to level 60 grind
out stuff im arguing that most people dont play
games to run out of challenges games shouldnt be
designed to end as far as new content goes
currently there arent a lot of things outside pvp that a
super or a titan can do that involves some level of risk
and an equitable rewardi feel that it is insulting to
veterans and those who have truly spent the time to
be in the upper content only to bang their head on the
cap all im saying is keep pushing the envelope of
whats challenging its a challenge to run a sanctum
in a standard fit battleship its insanely mundane to
do the same in a carrier but there isnt anything
higher to dowhen you engage your veterans more
intensely you create more goals for players to
achieve you deepen their investment into the game
you keep their business longer that improves the
gamethanks for the comment
comment from redditwhat are your thoughts on other
forms of pve missions and explorationhow would
you justify a gated capitalsanomaly in terms of risk
since tackle ships and hictors would be unable to
take this gate from the sound of itmy responsei
cant speak to the exploration aspect of the game
mostly because its never interested me enough to
make me want to learn itpve is an aspect of gaming
that has a lot of different subgenres to it some
people like anom lair style some like incursion
group quest style some datarelic solo puzzle
style some like mission quest style and then
theres story arcs i think this is such a deep topic that
books can be and probably are written about itas
for missions thats really a standard part of gaming a
quest based system that has steps and a reward i
dont think theres anything wrong with it its just
one of those must have things in a game where i
would advocate for some improvements is in amount
of content im the kind of person who thinks we
should have 20 times more modules and items in the
game i dont think you could ever have enough of
that type of content the more you have the greater
the customization of fits and that can really drive
player investmenttldr id greatly increase variety
difficulty and rewards of themgonna make a second
post about the gated anomsthe gated anom idea is
still one im working on in my mind but i think there is
some merit in it i had some thoughts about it that
have since showed some flaw after discussion with
corp mates there are currently inverse pve
environments where capitals arent allowedthe basic
idea is that complexity of the environment be
increased yeah not being able to tackle it seems to
be an downside of that concept maybe this isnt the
answer but bring a capital ship and tackle iti would
be 100 open to discussion on that specifically
for the second year of the elections of the csm i wish
to add a topic to the agendas and proposals of all the
candidatestake our petition to ccp to make a
localized client in spanish for eve onlinewe have
made a petition in the order of hundreds of signatures
in changeorg a active campaign in social media with
the hashtag quieroeveenespaUFFFDol and this
past year in eve vegas 2016 i personally took the
cause quieroeveenespaUFFFDol to
ccpseagul ccporca and others in ccp games
at this time we dont have a clear timeline of this
happeningafter the alpha clone patch was released
we have seen a considerable rise of new players of
spanish speaking backgrounds all our forums social
media groups and media channels it is clear that now
more than ever having a client in spanish is a must
spanish is the second most spoken language in the
world with well over 400 million speakers dozens of
nations of whom just a fraction now play eve due to
the limitation of the client in contrast we have the
client localized in japanese were just a fraction of the
world speaks it  it makes sense to have it in both
player numbers and profits for ccp there is
precedence that in the past ccp was looking to do it
but it did not get off the ground make this one of your
goals as a csm member and you will have the votes
and support of the hole spanish playing community of
eve please take it in considerationbest
regardsjdreference

1 we need spanish client to facilitate the game to
spanish speaking players
quieroeveenespaUFFFDol
id be happy to push for more multiple language
support and accessibility within eve online its a great
idea and opens new markets
im supporting thissigned
hellomy question  what is your viewpoint regarding
faction standings and as a csm member what
changes would you propose to ccp pertaining to
game mechanics for faction standings good luck to
you in the upcoming csm electiondmc
thank you for the questioni see that your query is
important to you and that you have been asking a lot
of the csm candidates for their thoughts to answer
honestly i have not had to deal with faction standings
for a long time while i did participate in caldari faction
warfare my time was brief and the experience did not
harm my standings too badly with other factions
many games have a faction system and allow for
players to partake in a type of regional politics
similar to what we see in eve though the eve system
is far more branched detailed and complicated to
understand minutely lets consider the problemthe
biggest issue really is educating the new player that
their standings can and will have long term
implications should they pursue pve missions or
faction warfare for a long enough time if you begin
the game doing caldari navy missions and then
move to caldari faction warfare and after 3 months of
play finally get the nerve to venture to other areas of
space you will find that youve screwed yourself over
without realizing it and that it may take another 1 or 2
months before you can safely fly to dodixie
depending on your time commitment to eve we could
implement a buyback system using tags or other
items but then eve factions effectively become
meaningless to everyone but the hard core role
player its no longer a decision of what am i willing
to work for but of how much isk do i needi could
definitely see adding a buy back or donation system
to certain smaller factions but only as a foot in the
door measure to the bigger guys making faction
standings easier to acquire and manipulate will also
have market effects that need to be considered
specific ships and modules are only available based
on faction standings the easier it is to acquire those
standings the less rare the items and the more
flooded the market upsetting balances and leading to
recessions in certain sectors heres my two thoughts
on how to make this better for the new player as a
whole without terribly upsetting market values and
balances we could setup an in game system that
allows you to check how an action will affect your
standings with a faction andor a ui change that
makes it a lot easier to see recent changes to your
faction standings at a glance we can add warnings
and dialogue to the npe as well as to other actions
about to join fw making achoice between two gates
in a mission involving separate factions etc that
says something about how you can screw your
faction standings hard core for dropping off that cargo
or blapping amarr navy ships in a caldari mission
tldr  dont add a buy back system unless its only for
the smaller subfactions add more warnings to the
npe and elsewhere in game and maybe a ui change
that can make changes to your standings easier to
understand and track
thanks for the replyyes its an important aspect of
the game not only to me but to a lot of other players
as well i must say i like and agree 100 with what
you posted ccp definitely needs to incorporate more
awareness to faction standings ingame this game
was based on having a balance in risk vs reward
and actions vs consequences which makes this
game great currently the only way to repair negative
faction standings is to grind missions it takes time for
players to ruin faction standings and it should take
some time to repair those standings in the past
characters use to be accountable for their actions in
game now most everything has been dumbed down
and turned into easy mode for the instant gratification
crowd thats something i dont want to see happen to
faction standings currently the ingame aspects of
faction standings positive faction standings are the
only way to access cosmos agents one time
accesspositive faction and corporation standings
are needed to access research agentsall other
agents only require minimal amount of faction
standing for access 200 or higher standinghigh
faction standings reduce market broker fees and
reprocessing fees in npc stationsat 500 or lower
faction standing empire npcs will attack when in
their spacei think ccp made a big mistake when they
removed the need to have faction standings to
anchor pos in high sec space id like to see more
content pertaining to faction standings be added to
the game but at this time my inquiry is based more on
the effects of negative faction standingsi created and
shared the faction standing repair plan with the
playerbase back in 2010 in my opinion players need
more options available to repair negative faction
standings then what ive listed in the plan most of
those event agents can only be accessed once in the
characters life a lot of players ingame dont even
read the forums so they dont know that guide is
available in fact repairing negative faction standings
is a big task for experienced players new players
who havent even learned the game yet can easily
mess up their faction standings right from the start
without even knowing it resulting in no access to half
of empire spacethese are some options i think would
help players ingamefaction standing repair process
be implemented ingame to be very intuitive not
obscure tutorial perhapschanges to empire faction
standings notify players with on screen pop up
message option to deactivateactions that would
cause negative empire faction standing trigger on
screen pop up warning option to deactivateall anti
empire mission briefings have a warning to inform
players those missions will incur negative faction
standingsimplement tags for standings ingame
based on similar game mechanics as tags for
securityadd npc agents to ingame agent finder for
faction standing repair similar to proposal in my
forum signatureanyway thanks again for the reply
and good luck in the upcoming electiondmc
my vote is for you and thank you one more time for
bringing issues towards ccp that were bothering
mefor csm 12my top 5 issues for csm 12 to take for
ccp to consideration1 pve missions are stagnant and
have not seen any improvement in years and not
talking about burner missions burners i find
extremely annyoing as if you are required to fly
specific fit to be able to even do it there is something
wrong with it try do all burners with minmatar ships
for example doable maybe fun no2 battleships
these back in the day felt good now these feel like big
targetloot piUFFFData hopefully csm 11 results
show up here and there will be change3 marauders
allmost all other ships have gotten buffs and
overhauls but marauders still are the same they were
when first introduced i love my marauders all except
the gallante kronos that thing is just bad even if the
balance change would be to just make them
comparable with eachother that would be start and i
know marauders are not the most popular ship well
maybe they are not popular because it takes years to
train the skills for all marauders and price is quite
high and there has been no overhaulsimprovements
to marauders in years4 drones when will ccp see
the light that drones are too strong compared to most
other weapon systems drones are quite popular in
fw i wonder why most exploration people are using
drone setups because most exploration ships get
drone bonuses how about adding exploration ships
with other weapon systems also5 ganking in hisec
way too easy with little actual risk for you

hello jintaanwe had a small discussion about faction
standings in my assembly hall proposal  bring back
the endless battle missionsnow im not going to ask
if you actually conversed with ccp about it nor do i
want to know the outcome of that discussion if in fact
you actually did bring it to their attentionmy question
 what is your viewpoint regarding faction standings
and as a csm member what changes will you
propose to ccp pertaining to game mechanics for
faction standings good luck to you in the upcoming
csm electiondmc
hellomy question  what is your viewpoint regarding

mechanics for faction standings good luck to you in
the upcoming csm electiondmc
so this has been on of my fears specifically with
regards to the npe dumping people off in faction
warfare faction standings can seriously screw up a
players long term game its to hard to alter these
standings back to a balanced level for experienced
players and consodering a new player wont
understand the significance of the standinga till its
too late and the damage will be donei think like sec
statu there should be a buy this and exchange for
favorwith a faction allowing people to get back to
possitive standingswith the faction they need to
though im game to see other approachs and ideas
thanks for the replythis game was founded on the
premise of having a balance on risk vs reward and
actions vs consequences it takes time for players to
ruin faction standings and as such it should also take
some time to repair those standings i know its tough
on new players who havent learned the game yet i
use to be one of those players who was victimized by
negative faction standings until i decided to do
something about it after 3 months of research in
2010 i created and shared the faction standing
repair plan with the eve online communityi agree
there should be more options available for characters
to repair negative faction standings but i dont like the
idea of having tags for standings just like tags for
security i think those are nothing more than a get out
of jail free card for actions that should merit some
consequences in the past characters use to be
accountable for their actions ingame now most
everything has been dumbed down and turned into
easy mode for the instant gratification crowdin my
opinion antiempire missions should have a warning
to alert players that accepting and completing those
mission will affect their faction standings in a
negative aspect also the process of standings repair
should be implemented ingame to be more intuitive
instead of being so obscure lastly ccp could add
another group of npc agents strictly for faction
standing repair sorta like the proposal i have listed in
my forum signatureanyway thanks again for the
reply and good luck in the upcoming electiondmc
i caution against a full faction status buyback system
on the grounds that would cause further problems
with other in game systems we might solve the
problem of oops i blapped my standings when i
blapped them ships but wed devalue the use of
faction standings overall it might be better to try and
increase the visibility of faction standings and the
changes your actions can have as well as increase
the ingame awareness of faction standings through
warnings and npe education i wouldnt mind seeing
ccp add value to faction standings overall through
reworking the use of standings in some way it might
help to improve life for those who seek a more pve
play style in eve edit i do conceed that some form of
buy back  bribe system for the minor factions that
cross empire borders but are tied to one of the major
factions might be a good idea to allow people to get
their footing back when accidents happen
couod scale it have a max that can be bought back
enough not to get shot at in their space obviously
not pump to 10 im just spitballing ideas i dk t really
have a firm opinion on it
i agree there added a concession edit to my

thanks for stopping by i feel i have grown up since
my first and most successful campaign the
exchange with sasha however is nothing new there
are similar exchanges in my last two campaign
threads i am neither naive nor arrogant enough to
think that ccp will suddenly change their minds about
nonconsensual pvp just because i say so
anyway i am playing eve because i choose to play
eve when i want to play in peace and quiet i play
something like transport tycoon although my old
computer is too quick for that now fantasticum
just a couple of questions1 can you think of a way
to turn war decs into a meaningful consistent and
playable experience for everyone involved2 do you
bring a voting block with you or is it just you3 what
do you wanto7ps bumping has been raised a lot as
a theme again i belong to probably the 10 people
that has actually gone and read the whole cp
thread on the subject i plan to make a longer post
about that this evening  night eu time maybe you
could critique it let me know what you think
thanks for stopping byfaction standings they seem
a lot more superfluous since more things are getting
done in citadels even in high sec i wish someone
had told me at the beginning that by doing missions i
could end up being unable to fly in gallente space
but other than stuff like that i think the issues they
cause are overshadowed by other things if i were to
get elected however of course the concerns of all
carebears should be taken into accountwhat is you
problem with faction standings and what do you think
ccp should do about it
thanks for the replyas a csm candidate for high sec i
would think youd view faction standings a lot more
than just superfluous since they have a large impact
on high sec game play as you very well know the
consequences of not knowing about faction standing
game mechanics can easily mess up a players game
play activities especially new playerspersonally i
dont have any problems with faction standings
especially after creating the faction standing repair
plan back in 2010what id like to see ccp do is have
the process of faction standing repair be
implemented into the game so that its intuitive
instead of being obscure antiempire missions
should have a warning to alert players that accepting
and completing those missions will have a negative
affect on their faction standings lastly ccp could add
another group of npc agents to the game strictly for
faction standing repair sorta like the proposal i have
listed in my forum signatureanyway thanks again for
the reply and good luck in the upcoming electiondmc

faction standings for me are pretty much a moot
pointi have 93 with amarr empire 91 with
ammatar 74 with caldari state yet they dont provide
me with any benefitsyou dont even need good
standings to deploy citadels anymorethe size of the
population the negative standings actually affect
could probably be counted on your handsif you live in
lowsec nullsec or wh space they have no affect on
you since i am a nullsec person suggesting fixs for
them is not something i should be doing
thanks for the replyas for negative faction standings
not affecting very many players i have to disagree
and can attest to the fact that it does indeed affect
lots of players i know because im the author of the
faction standing repair plan which i created back in
2010since you have high faction standings with
amarr ammatar and caldari its reasonable safe to
say you have negative faction standings with gallente
and minmatar which more than likely has cut out
access to almost half of empire space granted
youre a null sec player who probably only deals with
the jita market hub but players in wspace face
problems getting to market if their hole doesnt open
in a faction friendly systemanyway thanks again for
the reply and good luck in the upcoming electiondmc
oglad to see you running for the position it would
really be a great asset to the csm to have somebody
with your knowledge and understanding of the game
on boardyou have perfect knowledge of how smaller
groups can operate and survive within nullsec thats
both iskwise politics and longtermive experienced
this first hand and can only hope you succedfly safe
actually my standings with others are not as bad as
they can be you can do missions for groups that
have positive standings with all factions to keep your
standings from dropping too low yes i have 3 to
gallente and 4 to minmatar it is still possible to
improve them without directly using their agents i
beleve its soe that can improve standings with all
areasthank you chigy

can you clarify what you mean about by faction
standings like overall security status standings
towards empires corporations im curious to see
what issues you see with this in particularas my
personal standpoint goes in 995 of all cases i
couldnt care less about faction standings as im
primarily a wormhole pilot so i myself dont really
interact enough with them to have a strong opinion
towards changing them
thanks for the replymy question pertains to a
characters faction standing towards empire factions
not their personal security statusas a wspace pilot
having negative faction standings with an empire
faction could cause problems for transporting goods
to market especially if your hole opened up in an
unfriendly faction systemanyway thanks again for

i think its a hit and miss with regards to faction
standings in my time with mission running i have
always personally avoided missions that would result
in standing loss  as someone who does logistics
around the map in high sec i am very careful in that
respects with what would happen if i were to dip my
status with a faction too low and end up getting shot
risk vs rewardits a pretty steep consequence to
have standing hits from missions  but at the same
time there has to be some risk involved with shooting
other factions  obviously if you shoot at caldari npcs
its only natural that your standings would get messed
up i mean you shot their friendsi also remember
back when standings effected if you could make jump
clones or not and how i busted by butt in missions to
get the standings needed for npc corps to make
those clones in high sec only to have them not matter
later on  dont get me wrong i love that you can
make jump clones anywhere now regardless  but
there was also this rewarding feeling when you finally
get to that point where you have reached your goal
past from what you could get in the lp storethe
rewards you seem to only get now that matter are the
lp store credits and less of the feeling of
accomplishment like how i felt when i got my
standings for the clones or even a corp working
together to place a pos up in hs but if you loose
enough standings you become a target i would like
to see there be a easier way to regain those
standings
thanks for the reply but you didnt really give an
answer to my question other than you think its a hit
and miss situation which needs an easier way to
repair negative faction standingsthis game was
founded with the premise of having a balance on risk
vs reward and actions vs consequences it takes
time for players to ruin their faction standings and as
such it should also take time for players to repair
those standings in the past characters were
accountable for their actions ingame now most
everything has been dumbed down and turned into
easy mode for the instant gratification crowdnow i
agree there was a time long ago when having
negative faction standings prohibited players from
enjoying all aspects of the game that myth was due
to players just accepting that consequence as fact
instead of actually searching for a remedy to correct
that situation course the process of standings repair
should have been implemented to be more intuitive
within the game instead of being so
obscureunfortunately ccp doesnt like to present
things in black  white they prefer various shades of
gray and enjoy seeing the player base figure things
out on their own ccp distributes the content
throughout the game for players to find and put the
pieces together players then share that info with the
community thats what makes this game great i
know because i use to be one of those players who
felt victimized by negative faction standings until i
decided to do something about it after 3 months of
research in 2010 i created and shared the faction
standing repair plan the plan with the eve online
community time and time again it proved itself to the
playerbase that it not only easily and quickly repaired
negative faction standings it also helped boost
positive faction standings as wellone of the main
points for having high faction standings was the
ability to anchor pos in high security systems granted
that aspect of faction standing game mechanic was
removed by ccp which in my opinion was a huge
mistake another point for having high faction
standing is reduced broker fees as well as reduced
refining fees in npc stationsanyway im sure we can
all agree theres a few game mechanics that
definitely need to be revised including the one
pertaining to faction standings i just wanted to know
what your stance is on faction standings and what
changes youd propose to ccpthanks again for the
reply and good luck to youdmcquote
im slightly confused at your response you brought
up things that i did talk about tho i noticed that you
are copy and pasting the same response around that
aside i did talk about the consequence that you face
and how i do feel that the feeling of reward isnt the
same as it used to be thats my viewpoint what
changes i would bring up to make it easier to regain
standings perhaps simular to tags like we have for
sec status orand to bring back a way to have that
feeling of reward again someway ie having
standings matter  bringing back a sense of reward
when you work up your standings how exactly  well
im not sure how to 100 answer that csm arent
minidevelopers and to try to promise something
isnt right what i can do provide the feedback to ccp
on the topic thanks edited for clarification
thanks for the reply againsorry if my copy and paste
offended you its merely done for time efficiency
since theres a lot of candidates to review also most
answers to my question are very similaranyway i
agree with what youve posted here and once again i
wish you good luck in the upcoming electiondmc
it didnt offend me but more curious since some of
the mentions were stuff that i did talk aboutthank you
very much for the questions
hellofirst of all i agree theres a few game mechanics
that definitely need to be revised including the one
pertaining to faction standingshowever i disagree
with your viewpoint this game was based on having
a balance in risk vs reward and actions vs
consequences which makes this game great
currently the only way to repair negative faction
standings is to grind missions it takes time for
players to ruin faction standings and it should take
some time to repair those standings in the past
characters use to be accountable for their actions in
game now most everything has been dumbed down
and turned into easy mode for the instant gratification
crowd thats something i dont want to see happen to
faction standings currently the ingame aspects of
faction standings positive faction standings are the
only way to access cosmos agents one time
accesspositive faction and corporation standings
are needed to access research agentsall other
agents only require minimal amount of faction
standing for access 200 or higher standinghigh
faction standings reduce market broker fees and
reprocessing fees in npc stationsat 500 or lower
faction standing empire npcs will attack when in
their spacein my opinion ccp made a big mistake
when they removed the need to have faction
standings to anchor pos in high sec space id like to
see more content pertaining to faction standings be
added to the game but at this time my inquiry is
based more on the effects of negative faction
standingsi created and shared the faction standing
repair plan with the playerbase back in 2010 in my
opinion players need more options available to repair
negative faction standings then what ive listed in the
plan most of those event agents can only be
accessed once in the characters life a lot of players
ingame dont even read the forums so they dont
know that guide is available in fact repairing negative
faction standings is a big task for experienced
players new players who havent even learned the
game yet can easily mess up their faction standings
right from the start without even knowing it resulting
in no access to half of empire spaceanyway these
are some options i think would help players in
gamefaction standing repair process be
implemented ingame to be very intuitive not obscure
tutorial perhapschanges to faction standings notify
players with on screen pop up message option to
deactivateactions that would cause negative faction
standing trigger on screen pop up warning option to
deactivateall antiempire mission briefings have a
warning to inform players those missions will incur
negative faction standingsimplement tags for
standings ingame based on similar game mechanics
as tags for securityadd npc agents to ingame agent
finder for faction standing repair similar to proposal

jr is a good man
i have removed some post by a player for the above
reason refered to the community team for further
action
well i guess that answers half of the question that
ive been posting to all csm candidates my question 
what is your viewpoint regarding faction standings
and as a csm member what changes will you
propose to ccp pertaining to game mechanics for
faction standings good luck to you in the upcoming
csm electiondmc
something ive already proposed is tags for faction
standing much like tags for sec wont take it above
0 but provides an easy if expensive way to repair
your standing if you did whats pretty common for
beginners and took the faction missions which
tanked your standing
thanks for the reply stevethis game was founded
with the premise of having a balance on risk vs
reward and actions vs consequences it takes time
for players to ruin their faction standings and as such
it should also take time for players to repair those
standings i know its tough on new players who
havent learned the game yet antiempire missions
should have a warning to alert players that accepting
and completing those mission will affect their faction
standings in a negative aspect i agree there should
be more options available for characters to repair
negative faction standings but i dont like the idea of
having tags for standings just like tags for security i
think those are nothing more than a get out of jail free
card for actions that should merit some
consequences in the past characters use to be
accountable for their actions ingame now most
everything has been dumbed down and turned into
easy mode for the instant gratification crowdanyway

firts at all ty for you question second well everything
we do on this game it give us consecuenses but the
point is if i understand correctly how we can fixed
well just start doing more missions i know it takes a

standings with concord

well as i remember when i started the game i didnt
know anything about standings at all so i would say
faction standings need to be explained more to new
players i had zero idea that running missions for one
faction killed your standings for another i think
maybe a tutorial to explain it and to explain how to fix
your standings that was built into the game would be
a big help

helloim now running for csm xii for the first time
check out my candidate page too here is why you
should vote for me my personality about problems i
have really high motivation to understand and
analyse problems and mechanics i want to find ways
to make it easier to find others to play with i think eve
should be easy to understand but hard to master
problems are rarely simple and we need better
analysis and conversation so we can find solutions
my platform is not about the changes that should be
made or things i would push for ccp im here to give
you my skills on communication problem analyzing
and finding solutions i have strong background from
wormholes but i drive to understand game
phenomenons in all other areas too i love to find out
why things work as they do and why people do what
they dowhile im relatively new to the game i excel at
finding the small details and understanding how
things and systems work i often know more details
about some topics than older players of course not
always or about everything luckily i have
experienced pilots from all areas of the space to talk
to basically the whole finnish community that has lot
of amazing pilotsive mostly lived in wormhole space
but i have tipped my toes to all other areas too i have
deep knowledge about mechanics in wormhole
space i have done my share of corporation
management where i have mainly focused on
recruiting and diplomacy i like to understanding what
people really want and then use that knowledge to
help them or usi also spend some time in null under
paisti syndicate i learned a lot how things differ from
wormhole life for example fleet combat has vastly
different characteristics and that is just so fascinating
lately i have kept up with null combat via incursions
by finnish community while i love wormholes null
sec combat has aspects that intrigue mein real life
im studying computer science in one of the top
universities in finland im clearly a researcher in
nature even though i have been working multiple
years as system administrator lately i have gotten
back to software development and also i have done
bit of work on eve related tools eg eve wspace in
both eve and rl i like to teach others were that about
embedded systems or eve mechanicsim not sure
why different candidates really want to be in csm but
for me its the possibility to help to make the game
better for everyone i personally see that im in a
good position to gather feedback and ideas from
players in different areas of the game and my interest
of finding the real problems under what people
perceive makes me a good candidate for the csmi
think ccps development for past few years has been
in correct direction while there have been changes
that might seem bad or were really scary before
release i think all of them are relative ok i can
understand why aegis sov doesnt seem good and it
isnt as is but i still think it was good try and was
change in the correct direction that area of course
requires more development and more ideas to try
outyou can find me often commenting in the eve
subreddit i like to share the knowledge i have
gathered im also active in tweetfleet slack as i like to
argue about eve stuff if you visit fanfest remember
to poke me so we can talk about eve i have
understood that im easy to talk to and i like to listen i
like to talk about eve its mechanics and how things
could be done differentlyyou can ask more here in
this thread or via social mediasreddit
uraphendyrtweetfleetslackcom raphendyr
twitter raphendyrevediscord
raphendyr2538eve mail raphendyr nardieuemail
raphendyrsudcospace if above are not
possibleplease try to keep eve related stuff to these
as you might find me from other medias too

finding your place and working togetherthe single
most important thing in eve for a new player is to find
a group to play with one area is of course new player
experience where ccp has done lot of good work and
is continuing to do so huge an important part here
would be stumbling into other players when doing the
tutorials and following missionsin many fantasy
mmos you have tasks that require more than one
player to complete or some mission takes you to
single location on a map to do something eg kill x
monsters or a town these problems that require
multiple players or locations where you stumble on to
others are really good ways to meet other players
eve basically doesnt have similar aspects you could
go to jita but you dont really meet othersso we need
to find alternative ways for players to find each others
or we need to find ways to create similar behavior
into eve mechanicsome currently existing aspects
that try to be in this direction are wormhole sites and
incursions both are best done in groups while of
course they can be done with single player with alts i
personally would like to see more problems that
would be best solved with 35 players requining
focus from all of course we need things that can be
done solo but we allready have lot of those for
example null sec ratting doesnt really praise working
as a groupeasy to understand hard to masterwhen it
comes to game mechanics missions or complexity i
prefer this simple rule being good shouldnt come
just from knowing how things work but from mastery
of applying that knowledge to practicefor example
missions and sites in eve are known before and all
stats are in wikisguides thus they have nothing
hard as long as you know how to google in this area i
love the development around mining operations and
the aiin wormholes there are a lot of known and
many not so known small details that when known
can help you a lot some of these things might be
bugs and some are just how this game is
implemented for example one can keep his
wormhole system disconnected from rest of the
cluster as long as he likes presuming no incoming
connections appear with someone coming in from
those while i benefit a lot of these i dont think hidden
things are good for eve in long run nor are they
interestingof course knowledge is required for one to
master it and i for sure like that eve is one of the
hardest games i have ever played good example of
mastering knowledge is good fleet commanding best
null sec fcs can place their own fleet in correct
position against the enemy and force the enemy to
make mistakes that is absolutely beautiful when
executed well basic knowledge of why these fleets
work as they do isnt really complicated but using
that knowledge to predict what the enemy will do is
the mastery partso i think all game mechanics
should be simple to understand and the information
should be enough clear from the game but to apply
that knowledge should require skillreal problems are
rarely simpleafter some years working in it support i
have learned that people often come to ask action for
a solution they have often after delving into the
problem it can be seen that the solution the person
had wasnt really the good one for his real problem i
think people tend to simplify problems and then
choosing the first solution that comes to mindusing
interesting topic of cloaky campers that comes up in
reddit time to time as an example commonly the
solution presented is to turn off the cloak module in
some way eg using service in structures consuming
fuel or capacitor of course these kind of changes
would be huge especially for the wormholes and
explorationfor this solution there are at least two
underlying problems it tries to solve in null you are in
huge danger from the cynos if some cloaked ship
can light a cyno next to you you are most likely dead
also as far as i know the neutral ships affect the sov
indexes in some way at least indirectlyso is the real
problem the cloak module or combination of cloak
and cyno or even interceptor with cyno or simply
the cynothe point here is that even if i would best
represent wormhole space i try my best to think all of
areas of space when looking for solutions i also try to
think about problems from different perspectives and
players points of views problems arent simple and
so arent the solutions
moreeve nt interview
hellomy question  what is your viewpoint regarding
faction standings and as a csm member what
changes will you propose to ccp pertaining to game
mechanics for faction standings good luck to you in
the upcoming csm electiondmc
currently those have basically no point and the time i
heard ccp affinity had great plans for corpfaction
standing i liked iti personally would prefer they would
have meaningful aspect in the game of course this is
really hard problem if one would have high standing
towards gallente they would have low standing or
negative towards caldari and as we know jita is the
biggest trade hub it would make for those characters
impossible to go there of course they could use alts
but i dont think that is nice out comesure the
purpose for them needs to be meaningful but not
restrictive the choice to have high standing for some
needs to give such a reward that you choose to do so
with the penalty of losing standing towards to other
factionin other aspect wormholers often use hisec to
travel between wormhole chains those that have low
faction standings make it sometimes difficult as their
presence in some systems is problematic and they
for example cant wait on a gate before entering the
kspace system leading towards to wormholeon the
other hand eg low sec area could introduce more
interesting things presuming one could have positive
standing towards pirate faction too then one roaming
in low sec could have pirate ships repairing him when
fighting empire faction ships for exampleso i would
first look what we can make with those mining
operations and future npc that come after those i
think the most interesting mechanics are there in
short term

thanks for the reply but you didnt really give an
answer to my question other than you think they
currently have no meaningful point ingame and are
rather restrictive this game was founded with the
premise of having a balance on risk vs reward and
actions vs consequences it takes time for players to
ruin their faction standings and as such it should also
take time for players to repair those standings in the
past characters were accountable for their actions in

mistake another point for having high faction
standing is reduced broker fees as well as reduced
refining fees in npc stationsanyway im sure we can
all agree theres a few game mechanics that
definitely need to be revised including the one
pertaining to faction standings i just wanted to know
what your stance is for that topicthanks again for the
replydmc
well i dont have simple solutions for the problem i
only have the overall picture i can use to commend
ccp about the ideas they have and to filter and
continue ideas the player base hasso in simple
terms i support faction standings and there should be
meaningful purpose for them instead of removing
them fullythose were both quite logical reasons but
in the end how meaningful they were corporation
that anchors a pos normally has at least one person
that has enough standings for some faction or they
would use another corporations service for it for sure
it created player to player service but did that make
game more rich or notas i tried to explain above
problems are rarely so simple there would be clear or
simple solutions in this area im personally ok that
we focus on those features that could in the long run
use and benefit from the faction standings eg
mining operations and aione area where faction
standings could also play role is smuggling i would
love to see more reason and methods for smuggling
one example is items that would be contraband in
some areas of space eg amarr could ban
autocannons
thanks for the replyi agree that faction standings
should have a more meaningful purpose in game
play in my opinion ccp made a big mistake when
they removed the need to have positive faction
standings to anchor pos in high sec space having
that requirement made faction standings mean
something more instead of just a way to access
agents or to get lower broker fees now i would love
to see more content pertaining to positive faction
standings be added to the game however at this
time my inquiry is based on the negative effects of
faction standings to the playerbase since it takes
time for players to ruin their faction standings then it
should also take some time to repair those standings
unfortunately that info is basically nonexistent in
game when it should actually be readily available and
easily understood by playersover the past 7 years
the faction standing repair plan has helped
countless amount of players in the forums to rectify
what seemed like an unsolvable issue in my opinion
players need more options available to repair
negative faction standings then what ive listed in that
guide in fact most of those event agents can only be
accessed once in the characters life theres a lot of
players ingame who dont read the forums and dont
know that guide exists theyve basically accepted the
fact theyre cut off from engaging in available content
due to negative faction standings repairing negative
standings is a big task even for experienced players
who are familiar with the plan new players who
havent learned the game yet can easily mess up
their faction standings without even knowing it right
from the start resulting in no access to half of empire
spaceanyway i think all players should have the
option ingame to gain diplomatic immunity with the
empire factions the fact that the info pertaining to
faction standing repair is hidden from players in
game is the reason for my post after 7 years of
helping players in the forums to repair negative
faction standings i just wanted to provide some
feedback through the csm for ccp to consideri
believe these options would definitely help all players
ingamefaction standing repair process be
implemented ingame and be very intuitive not
obscure tutorial perhapschanges to faction
standings will notify players with on screen pop up
message option to deactivateactions that would
cause negative faction standing trigger on screen
pop up warning option to deactivateall antiempire
mission briefings have a warning informing players
those missions will incur negative faction
standingsimplement tags for empire standings in
game based on similar game mechanics as tags for
securityadd npc agents to ingame agent finder for
faction standing repair similar to proposal in my

essentially they are part of a content access
management system i feel that they may be
underutilized from the perspective that there isnt a
massive variety and difficulty of content that those
standings allow you access toim not a mission
runner and i dont currently have a lot of use for
faction standings the only change i would be willing
to push at this moment is that it would be great to
have 10  20 times more unique content in those
areas im all about pushing the envelope so bring
capital spawns or lairs into it make it intense make it
a challengethanks for the question fly safe o7
thanks for the replyhigh faction standings affect more
than just mission running it also reduces broker
market fees and reprocessing fees in npc stations in
the past there use to be a bit more content pertaining
to faction standings as well which ccp removed the
main one being the need to have high faction
standings to anchor a pos in empire space i agree
there should be more challenging content added to
the game in my opinion it should pertain to faction
standingsanyway thanks again for the reply and

thx and here some thoughts on faction standings
first i would bring back the eveo wiki there was this
great guide i think faction repair guide so players
would have a chance of knowing what is going on
second factions seem to be in slow decline as far as
i see it so i would argue that either we make them
meaningful or eliminate them for parts of the game or
over all like epic arks as another candidate think
djavin from eveu suggested  but at the moment
it seems ccp is slowly fading them outso what
would you like to see done with standings
thanks for the replyyeah i agree evelopedia was a
great resource despite ccp and others saying it was
too far out of date in fact it was mostly ccps data
base part of it that was really outdated getting rid of it
was a huge mistake also thanks im the one who
created and shared the faction standing repair plan
with the playerbase back in 2010 in my opinion
players need more options available to repair
negative faction standings then what ive listed in the
plan especially since most of those event agents
can only be accessed once in the characters life i
believe faction standings should be more meaningful
than just to get missions id like to see more content
pertaining to faction standings be added to the game
but at this time my inquiry is based more on the
effects of negative faction standings this game was
founded on the premise of having a balance on risk
vs reward and actions vs consequences it takes
time for players to ruin faction standings and it should
also take some time to repair those standings in the
past characters use to be accountable for their
actions ingame now most everything has been
dumbed down and turned into easy mode for the
instant gratification crowd thats something i dont
want to see happen to faction standingscurrently the
ingame aspects of faction standings  positive faction
standings are the only way to access cosmos agents
one time access positive faction and corporation
standings are needed to access research agents all
other agents only require minimal amount of faction
standing for access 200 or higher standing high
faction standings reduce market broker fees and
reprocessing fees in npc stations at 500 or lower
faction standing empire npcs will attack when in
their space positive faction standings use to be
needed to anchor a pos in high sec space until ccp
removed that aspect i believe that was another big
mistake anyway a lot of players ingame dont even
read the forums so they dont know about the faction
standing repair plan in fact repairing negative faction
standings is a big task just for experienced players
new players who havent even learned the game yet
can easily mess up their faction standings right from
the start without even knowing it resulting in no
access to half of empire spacethese are some
options i think would help players ingamefaction

yeah thats a good question would be nice to have
plexing raise faction standings
eve is very much a reactive game if you do
something wrong the game will punish you for it i
think personally this is a very reasonable there are
ways of repairing sec static
thank you for the replyonce again good luck in the
upcoming electiondmc
hi there can you clarify the question do you mean
in relation to getting a bad faction standing and then
having to repair it again
i think faction standings have lost a lot of value no
longer needed for pos anchoring jump clones etc
their only purpose atm is for missions and market tax
reduction im not sure how to make them useful
again without them being gimmicky contributer to
eve is easy
thanks for the reply yes i agree faction standings
have lost a lot of value and should be more
meaningful than just to get missions ccp never
should have removed the need of faction standings to
anchor a pos in high sec space in my opinion that
was a big mistakecurrently the ingame aspects of

empire missions should have a warning to alert
players that accepting and completing those missions
will incur negative faction standings an idea
presented by others is to have tags for standings
personally i dont really like the idea but if its similar
to tags for security i guess it would be acceptable
lastly ccp could add another group of npc agents to
the ingame agent finder strictly for faction standing

honestly dont think ccp has developers pool that can

the easy fix would be a tag system like we have for
sec status but i am pretty sure ccp wants to redo the
standing system overall at some point there is a lot of
fruity math happening that could be better too
this bothers me a little bit not the idea itself but that
you proposed it as it has already been in the game
for at least a decade im starting to become
concerned about the knowledge limits of the
carebear candidate
given the complaint about excess in trit and pyre in
another thread you could kill two birds with one post
and suggest that these be used as fuels for the
bubbles an anchor that sinks in neat
packageminers curryone cup of rice in the
cookercook small onion diced into the pan until it
starts to brown add 2 cans of tuna i use 185g cans x
2 having strained out the brine mash is down a little
bit to mix in the onion and cook for a whileone cup of
full cream milk add a heaped tablespoon of curry
powder one level tablespoon cornflower one stock
cube random flavor added crushed barmix or
stickblender that concoction then pour over the
cooked tuna and stir in heat on low until curry sauce
is fully absorbed by the fish serves two whenever
someone tries content to miners give them some
curry
unless ive gone totally senile always possible the
tags in game currently are single shot only agents
related to the old cosmos mission system not
reusable agentsthat said i dont like the instant
nature of tags currently and would love it if they ran
like a skill queue where you fuel it by handing in the
right tags and then over time a week or two it raises
your standings to zero or when you run out of tags
that way its not an instant free to go and gank again
but if you are actually trying to change your playstyle
it does let you transition to a new styleanyway sorry
steve getting a little off track here though its
something id love you to put forward to ccp as a
possible mechanic very much enjoyed your work and
communication over the last few years
youre talking about the data centerstheyre single
shot and have issues raising standing to 0 by
themselvesthis is why the commonly referenced
faction standing repair plan doesnt just tell people to
do them while you can do the low level ones by
themselves the higher level ones require standing to
run if you dont have it go enjoy your grind to get
itaside from that theyre in the highsec space of the
people who you need to repair it with which can
make the first few somewhat more difficult to deal
with as youre having to run from faction police while
doing so

i personally only ever did distribution missions
because i didnt want any factions standing to go
down di flew caldari distribution missions and the
epic arc yes that gives negative standing but well
and th soe epic arc to get caldari standings so my
taxes in jita would go downi dont have any intentions
to change anything related to this because i barely do
anything in hs that would affect me which in turn
means i dont see any issues with itif you point them
out to me i surely will find an opinion on the matter

this do you mean in relation to faction warfare and

standings
thanks for the replyjust the general overall aspect of

everyone i just wanted to know your viewpoint about
it and what changes youd proposedmc
 thats not a planif its not a priority just come out
and say it its such a small market segment to try to
appeal to so i wouldnt expect much effort in that
area except that the entire client in general should
be more usable than it is regardless a persons
condition is that a priority at all to have a better

to repair those standings in the past characters use
to be accountable for their actions ingame now
most everything has been dumbed down and turned
into easy mode for the instant gratification crowd
thats something i dont want to see happen to faction
standingsnow i know its tough on new players who
havent learned the game yet they can easily mess
up their faction standings right from the start without
actually knowing it i was one of those players
victimized by negative faction standings until i
decided to do something about it after 3 months of
research in 2010 i created and shared the faction
standing repair plan with the eve online community
in my opinion players need more options available to
repair negative faction standings then what ive listed
in the plan especially since most of those event
agents can only be accessed once in the characters
life i think the process of faction standing repair
should be implemented ingame to be more intuitive
instead of being so obscure all changes to faction
standings should be brought to the players attention
with an on screen pop up message any action that
would cause negative faction standing should trigger
an on screen pop up warning with option to
deactivate all antiempire missions should have a
warning to alert players that accepting and completing
those missions will incur negative faction standings
an idea presented by others is to have tags for
standings personally i dont really like the idea but if
its similar to tags for security i guess it would be
acceptable lastly ccp could add another group of npc
agents to the ingame agent finder strictly for faction
standing repair sorta like the proposal i have listed in
my forum signatureanyway thanks again for the
reply and good luck in the upcoming electiondmc

i look forward to the addition of more mechanics that
take advantage of the faction mechanics such as the
new npc mining fleets etci also think this has some
opportunity for standings to become less static and
have both your immediate impact and long term
standing taken into accounti am however quite
happy with how they currently sit meaning that it is
both not my place to develop game mechanics and i
have no wish to encourage prioritization of this
subset of mechanicsthanks for your question3
thank you for the replyonce again good luck in the
upcoming electiondmc
thank you very much for doing this outstanding work

these localize spanish threads have popped at least
once more then what the op as listed but i can only
remember once honestly thing is if ccp can make a
profit off localizing the game for spanish speaking
players that would be pretty great all around
however i honestly dont think that the demand for it
would be high enough even spain does not rank top
10 of internet usage sitting at 71 other places like
mexico is 43 and chile is 65 compared to english
which the usa is 842 and the uk is 89 france is
81 australia is 83 and japan is 86 also you have
to look at the culture of the speakers of sad
language most english speaking countries are very
heavily engrossed into the gaming subculture japan
even more so spanish native country dont really
come to mind when i think gaming however id
imagine partly french and german localization has
happened is because a lot of german and french
speak english and a second language so maybe
thats a possibility that could work in your
favorsource
valkin mordirc i disagreegames like lol wot wow
have a big presence by spanish speakers at this
moment la and spanish speaking countries have a
very fast growth rate and potential of business in the
coming years with internet penetration growing in
5 each year here are some numbers of

active pilots of each country activating their accounts
in just a few months after a localization plus all
native spanish speakers living other countries
interested in playing with fellow country men 
localizing a client is not that hard and support is not
that great of a deal in overhead the big win here is
having a game that has big numbers and big content
that will even attract more players of a already
saturated market of the existing localizations true
this is a business decision by the part of ccp but it is
a shallow assumption to rule out a localization
without an in depth look into the possibility
iUFFFDll go as far to say that the next big leap in
player count will be by emerging economies and
cultural diversity here is some food for though the
second most popular youtuber in the world is a
chiliean spanish speaker called holasoygerman
spanish content and more than 31 million
subscribersof the top 10 youtubers he is the only
one that has content in a language other than english
why is that why is he not chinnese or arab or
russianquieroeveenespaUFFFDol join in the
cause
you number show the same thing i said spanish is
lower than all the other localizations again its close
to english which where did you pull from as i would
assume that my source show english speaking users
should be higher than and your numbers show my
source seems to allude that your numbers might be
wrong or vise versa a lot of the countries you
mentioned ecuador mUFFFDxico
perUFFFD nicaragua panamUFFFD costa
rico the dominican republic and uruguay do not have
high internet penetration logically ccp could only
target spain maybe chile puerto rico and venezuela
spanish may be a popular language its a hell of a
useful language to know but unfortunately just
because a language is common doesnt mean itll be
prolific in a video game it also depends and where it
is spoken also i dont think saying that a business
decision is shallow ccp needs to make profits not
losses if they can not make a profit with spanish
localization then it hurts everyone else including the
spanish players as no one gets updates and patches
because they need to recoup like i said if the
demand is there i wholeheartedly support it but i
honestly dont think the demand is there running for
csm however and getting voted in would show that is
there and i wish you the best of luckdeletetheweak

goddamnit i was just typing up my response
i quite enjoyed the discussion we had there and
hope that you felt it was as productive as i did even
though our overall assesment of the issues didnt
really align in that circumstance at the end of the day
i believe that the fact that your plan exists is a
symptom of the overarching problem with standings
in that they are incredibly complex and unintuitive to
the average player as theyre not communicated
particularly well in both terms of how they work and
the consequences of lowering themi wouldnt
propose any changes directly as i dont think thats a
good way to talk to ccp on a topic like this however i
have  as a result of you bringing it up  tried to
discuss with ccp on what they feel the intent and
value of the standings system is for the game and
how we can better utilize it for those aims i know
thats not the answer youre looking for and that
youre dissapointed nothing has been changed but
thats the reallity of the csm and how it works at the
end of the day were not ccps boss and i think
anyone who is going to try and tell you that theyll
make ccp do something is not only wrong but will
actively hurt the csm when theyre on it our job is to
give the community feedback on topics as we have
and provide expert knowledge on subjects that ccp
dont have the same depth of understanding that we
do
sorry about that wasnt sure when youd be back
hello jintaan and thanks for the reply i definitely
appreciate you taking the time to review and discuss
that proposal with me in the assembly hall thank you
once again for doing that i realize that csm doesnt
have any power to make ccp do anything they dont
want to do also i agree with most everything youve
posted here now i may be wrong but doesnt csm
also provide feedback to ccp on topics that the
community is concerned with as well granted theres
not a lot of players currently rage posting about
faction standings in the forums not to sound like i
have a big ego but the reason for that is due to me
posting the plan back in 2010 over the past 7 years
it has helped countless amount of players to rectify
what seemed like an unsolvable issue because of
that ive been praised and referred to as the
consummate faction standing expert in the
forumsnow dont get me wrong i enjoy the eve fame
for that but as i said before theres a lot of players in
game who dont read the forums and dont know that
guide exists theyve basically accepted the fact
theyre cut off from engaging in available content due
to negative faction standings repairing those
standings is a big task even for experienced players
who are familiar with the plan new players who
havent even learned the game yet can easily mess
up their faction standings without even knowing it
right from the start resulting in no access to half of
empire spacesince im referred to as the faction
standing expert in the forums i just wanted to provide
some feedback through the csm for ccp to consider

my pleasurei play in high sec faction standings 
now that i know not to do missions that end up with
me being banished from for example amarr space
have actually no effect on my high sec gameplay at
all especially now that the standings requirement for
jump clones has been removed it is true i could
make more iskies trading at stations with better
standings refining at stations with better standings
and manufacturing at stations with better standings
but then there are for example citadels that make
me regret having wasted so much time grinding
standings out i make more than enough iskies
without caring about standings and the characters on
which i ground out standings are actually now more
or less sitting around so i can make more money with
skill injectorsjust in case i had one of those not
really knowing what it means moment i looked it
upsuperfluousadjective1 being more than is
sufficient or required excessive 2 unnecessary or
needless 3 obsolete possessing or spending more
than enough or necessary extravagant which i think
pretty exactly hits the nail on the head i am sorry i
just dont think they are as relevant as they were in
2010that is indeed my only concern about them
new players getting trapped into grinding after
reading outdated guides or accidentally getting their
mains kill on sight by the caldari policei hope the
other candidates had something constructive to say
on the issue maybe you should collate the
responses somewhere so that people interested in
faction standings can easily reference who best to
vote for

thanks for the replyjust the general overall aspect of
faction standings ingame which basically affects
everyone i just wanted to know your viewpoint about
it and what changes youd proposedmc
thanks for the reply and clarification if i get elected ill
keep your suggestions in mind also look out for
some interviews i did on podcasts such as statecraft
talking in stations and about to record declarations of
war  contributer to eve is easy
pi does need improvement overall in my opinion and
many others do agree as well i dont see what i
mentioned ruining it but a few things that could
improve its overall quality of life  which that said
tho i do agree that we havent seen yet what the new
moongo changes are going to do to the moongoo
market and im still very anxious to hear more details
on the drilling platforms as we dont have too much
info on them just yet
thank you once again and for sure would love to
have better options at repairing the standings as well
looks like you just support healthy gameplay and a
better game for everyone got my vote
ok thanks for the replyonce again good luck in the
upcoming electiondmc
i have updated the op with some helpful links does
anybody have questions
its actually comical how you have such a strong and
hateful opinion about something that doesnt really
matter a lot or about having to spend a little more isk
and time to keep your trap locations bubbledit is
actually comical
as a mechanic it makes sense to have but it feels
very archaic and there are limited ways to improve
standings some ways are very esoteric and its a
grind if youre starting from lownegative standings
one thing to consider further is that things like
markets and industry are moving away from npc
stations to citadels and these standings are having
less relevancy perhaps if they were linked to other
mechanics like lp purchasesdiscounts i think they
have some impact but only for enabling purchase it
would help make them a bit more relevant  but this
would be a low priority thing for ccp i would assume
concerning stabbed ships if it is not possible to
disallow entry of ships fitted with wcs into plexes
then a reasonable solution may be to adjust the
requirement to fit a wcs to not be within the pgcpu of
frigs but still be available for use by larger hulls this
way fw players finally get a solution against the wcs
menace but not take away an option for the rest of
the gamei feel pretty indifferent towards the suspect
timer when entering plexes were already in low sec
so we can already attack each other in the middle of
space without much consequence i would be careful
about giving t4t5 pay outs for killing war targets
regardless of what tier your faction is in seeing as we
have not yet seen any changes in fw in a post citadel
world we may be messing up  missing an
opportunity to actually use the tier based pay outs to
provide rewards that are in line with fw
activitiesclone discount yes please thats a
reasonable quality of life improvement thats not
detrimental to the overall health of the warzonethank
you very much for your questions
making an effort to increase your faction standings
should mean something zero faction standings
should mean zero added rewards hopefully
whenever ccp is ready to tackle revising the
missioning system they will put more weight in what
content will be available based on faction standings
of course this runs on the assumption that there will
be added missions to the available pool if we do find
ourselves in such an environment the lp stores will
need to see revisions as well in order to provide
sufficient rewards based on the added commitment
a motivator to commit to gaining faction standings
which could in turn decrease enemy faction
standings could be more unique faction items
introduced to the lp stores that highlight attributes
and lore of the respective factionthank you for your
question

while i enjoy ruthless mad play environments it is
also true that i enjoy building and learningit is
extremely important that players have enough power
to be safe in game during early stages i think ccp is
indeed missing a lot of nuance in their analysis of
player behavior its basic human nature people shy
away from unsafe even tough guysless
neutrality but more options safe haven revamp1
eliminate npc corporation safe havens all players
would be placed into faction warfare corporations
after one week of gameplay unless they join a player
corp2 official safe havens player corps should be
able to pay concord for immunity from wardec as
long as they meet certain requirementsno outposts
or citadels can be ownedno structures
anchoredhq must be in highsecaverage character
skillpoint under certain threshold3 the above could
also be an individual player option you get immunity
in highsec up to a certain age or sp level if the player
chooses to activate this option and anything up to 1
yr or a certain sp amount above the initial freebie will
cost the player some amount of isk after that year or
sp point this option will no longer be availablethis
is just a basic outline for acheiving that kind haven for
newbros that could help retention and gameplay
harrassment that is not harrassment per the rules in
eve should be eliminated in highsec in order to make
the game more enjoyable at the early low sp and low
knowledge point stageswill this make certain griefers
upset sure but who cares be brave and fight
someone who is interested
that is what hs is for it is the safest space in the
game although it is not safe in the sense that if
people want to and are willing to face the
consequences they can still shoot you people
typically move around hs with little or no interference
this notion that ganking especially of new players is
rampant is completely unsubstantiated bullshit in
fact im going to go so far as to call it a lie a blatant
bald face liefurther ccp has looked at new player
ganking and here are the findings1 it is rare about
1 of players are suicide ganked in their 15 days2
those who are suicide ganked or even killed legally
they tend to play longer than those not ganked at
allbottom line is that ganking of new players is both
rare and not detrimentalhere is a presentation of the
analysis
teckosthe video refers to an analysis of players
under 15 days old enough said your point is
garbage thats not where the ganking metagame is
even playedanyway back to the real point my target
is not the ganking meta game here if you read my
proposal its clear that im referring to a new way of
entering pvp and new way to give players
controlthere is a sweet spot for players who are
finally getting it and starting to do new things they
begin to fly better ships and barges and exhumers
and so on theres a point of frustration where their
rewards are not sufficiently high for their efforts
theres also a disconnect in the early stages from
players and npc corporationsthis is why i propose all
players be forced into a type of faction warfare early
on forcing them to go player corps is thats not their
thing but also my idea is about enabling players who
truly need safer learning environments to be immune
from attack in early stages provided they pay the
pricei am for a significant revamp of fw also as it is
currently it sucks and its not attractive
hello allsometimes the proof of something good is in
the details i have an issue with neutral npc corps and
neutral cans in space as they currently stand secure
containers should not be able to be dropped by
neutral entities but more importantly we need to be
able to destroy those cans why are they randomly
immune from all aggression its absurd and
theyre only used for advertisement lets make a real
advertisement moduleless neutrality but more
options safe haven revamp1 eliminate npc
corporation safe havens all players would be placed
into faction warfare corporations after one week of
gameplay unless they join a player corp2 official
safe havens player corps should be able to pay
concord for immunity from wardec as long as they
meet certain requirementsno outposts or citadels

the player some amount of isk after that year or sp
point this option will no longer be available
so this is my second suggestion to the game how
about adding a play button on the show info tabs of
systems and mabey even ships that include an audio
recording of how to say the name of what you are
looking at
max stop trolling my campaign thread no i will not
promise that they will happen yes i will bug every ccp
dev i meet about it just to get the point across that
alliances in wormhole space will definitely approve of
that qol change
caring compassionate considerate knowledgeable
he cares about the player community is considerate
of others and compassionate about his work with ccp
as a csm sir jintaan is an easy choice for me his
knowledge of the game and the issues facing players
is  in my opinion  second to none he is considerate
of others and will hear debates on many sides of an
issue yet present a balanced fair conclusion i am
thankful for the opportunity to play this game and
communicate with him daily he also has an
extremely sexy fc voice and remains calm and
collected under all circumstances a shining star in

to great effect and was  together with the mining
guides  a great helpperhaps it would also be great
to generally link to internal ccp and external player
content in the help files too as ccp recommends eve
uni and goon wiki anyway
sorry for the late replydisclaimer i dont really run
missions and most of my knowledge here is second
handits always bugged me that there are faction
damaging missions because most mission runners
will just avoid them anyways maybe there is a
reason for this that im not yet aware of but ive
always had the impression that only newer players
who dont understand the implications of running
these missions and having bad standings that they
then have to grind back up the consequences for
newer players of bad standings tend to far outweigh
the benefits of good standings with these factions it
would be nice to have tags to improve standings to
empires similar to security tags where you wouldnt
be able to gain positive standings only bring up
negative standings imoit would be nice to see
factions hold a more meaningful role in empire space
and the actions being made through these missions
affect an empires control over border systems or
something have the missions that damage standings
actually be over control of these border regions as a
more pve focused kind of fw just a thoughthopefully
this answered your questiontoxic
so the eve of the elections is upon usi would like to
take this time to encourage everyone to vote for
whoever they want or whoever their block tells
themit would be nice now that we have all forgotten
the drama of csmx if the percentage of participants in
the voting could start climbing so that the
playerbase representation of the csm could become
fact instead of fictioni am afraid ccp has a long way
to go in getting the numbers working for high sec
and from what i have observed in the last three years
the interest in the csm is dwindlingno and im also
not going to look for one as im not going to vote  a
fairly typical response from one of my exsupporters
on the subject of a solution to the low turnout in high
sec votersi think it would be nice if ccp could
bombard us with popups or notifications like that
cluster shutdown thing for downtime  for example at
login  so that everyone that logs into eve is at least
aware that the csm existsstill i am looking forward to
seeing what happens

my goal while i want to bring to the table awareness
around citadel balancing and improving pvp for all of
us my agenda is driven by youso it comes down to
getting a comprehensive list of action items from
each faction if you are the minmatar representative
and the collective wants to improve standing
mechanics thats going on the agenda i need each
faction to partner with one another and agree to what
must be heard by ccpi am also looking to ask ccp to
follow through on some items that they agreed were
an issue with fw over the years but pushed off to
invest in other areas of the gamei would like to see
plexing tie in with standings and if thats your priority i
would put that on the agenda so we are all

hi demichael crimsonregarding faction standings i
think its covered good by the social skills hjowever i
would say that just with sec standings where you can
findbuy tags and hand those in to improve your
standings something similar should arise for faction
standings however i do not know how feasible that
plan would be for ccp for that i would need to open
that discussion and see how its receivedi hope this
answers your questionkind regardseduard teach
thanks for the replyi agree turning in tags for
standings is definitely an option however in my
opinion social skills just barely keep the effects of
negative faction standings in check and thats only if
players keep watch on their standings and adjust
their gameplay accordingly i think faction standings
should have a more positive impact on game play
especially since eve online is based on having a
balance in risk vs reward and actions vs
consequences thats what makes this game great in
the past characters were accountable for their
actions now most everything is being dumbed down
and turned into easy mode for the instant gratification
crowd thats something i dont want to see happen to
faction standings currently the ingame aspects of
faction standings positive faction standings are the
only way to access cosmos agents one time
accesspositive faction and corporation standings
are needed to access research agentsall other
agents only require minimal amount of faction
standing for access 200 or higher standinghigh
faction standings reduce market broker fees and
reprocessing fees in npc stationsat 500 or lower
faction standing empire npcs will attack when in
their spacein my opinion ccp made a big mistake
when they removed the need to have positive faction
standings to anchor pos in high sec space having
that requirement made faction standings more
meaningful instead of just being a way to access
agents or to get lower broker fees now i would love
to see more content pertaining to positive faction
standings be added to the game however at this
time my inquiry is based more on the negative effects
of faction standings to the playerbase since it takes
time for players to ruin their faction standings then it

hi demichaeli totally agree that removing the need
for good faction standings for pos anchoring was a
mistake negative factionstandings is not something
newbros look into i only found out after 6 months of
playing and only thought at that time that
factionstandings only got hurt through storyline
events which is not the caseso i do believe repairing
those standings should be more clear as i stated
above the tag issue thing would be a start especially
if repairing those would only got as far as a specific
number lets say boost until negative standing 100
but i also do believe faction standings should be in
balance so when you are great buddies with
minmatar you cant be with amarr ieso that this
forces players to make choices on who they want to
be friends with otherwise the following would happen
if it becomes to easy to get good standings everyone
has great standings with the 4 big factions and the
pirate factions
thanks again for the great ama capsuleers as i
promised i will attach my ideas document in this
post hope to hear more feedback from all who are
interestedideas jonn
now i know that i bill myself as a wormhole candidate
but if i am elected i am not going to be representing
just the wormhole community ill be representing
everyone from the day 1 noob mining in a celestis in
a 09 system who skipped the tutorials to your
bitterest of bitter vets in null who have 10 titan
characters that havent logged on in years scattered
in different regions who just buys another one every
time his alliance moves regionsso eve i challenge
you want your opinion heard shoot me a line here
or mail me in game and i will come onto your comms
and talk
how do you plan to improve the new player
experience what are some flaws that you plan to
address in the csm and the new player experience
i have been running people through it to find
sequence breaks and other problems i have been
noting when the people i run through it get stuck or
have a confusion i give this data to ccp i am really
good at finding flaws in any system ccp seems to
have a ravenous appetite for fixing these flaws when
it comes to the npe
thanks mate
getting my vote itUFFFDs important the counsel
has fair and measured representation and i think you
bring this on the behalf of high sec industry and solo
playkeep up the good work
hello and thanks for the replyi agree there are limited
ways to improve standings and most of them are
indeed esoteric  unknown to most players and yes
youre right currently the only way to repair negative
faction standings is to grind missionseve online was
based on having a balance in risk vs reward and
actions vs consequences which makes this game
great in the past characters use to be accountable
for their actions ingame now most everything has
been dumbed down and turned into easy mode for
the instant gratification crowd thats something i dont
want to see happen to faction standings currently the
ingame aspects of faction standings positive faction
standings are the only way to access cosmos agents
one time accesspositive faction and corporation
standings are needed to access research agentsall
other agents only require minimal amount of faction
standing for access 200 or higher standinghigh
faction standings reduce market broker fees and
reprocessing fees in npc stationsat 500 or lower
faction standing empire npcs will attack when in
their spacein my opinion ccp made a big mistake
when they removed the need to have faction
standings to anchor pos in high sec space it made
faction standings more meaningful ingame than just
a way to access agents now id love to see more
content pertaining to faction standings be added to
the game but at this time my inquiry is based more on
the effects of negative faction standings to the
playerbase since it takes time for players to ruin
faction standings then it should also take some time
to repair those standings however the info to

faction standings are a facet of eves roleplay
component for aligning with a certain faction if you
make friends with one faction you will lose standings
with their foes through the means of derived
standingsthe issue with faction standings is they
have nearly no impact on actual gameplay except if
your faction standing is so low that you are being
shot by the faction police and  to a minor degree 
market broker fees if you are trading on an npc
stationsince faction standings are very hard to gain
it requires a lot of storyline missions being done they
should have at least some impact they could for
example have a role in future pve content also there
should be ways to repair negative faction standing
but again at the cost of losing standings with the foes
of that faction
thanks for the replyi agree that faction standings
should have a more positive impact on game play

raphendyr is a solid dude with very good attitude
towards game and its futurei believe he is a good
candidate for csmi have had many conversations
with him about the current state of the game and hes
ideas are really goodon the other hand he is also
quite realistic in his goals which he wants to achieve
if he reaches place in csm
before i vote for you can you tell us how truthful you
were when you said you were going to biomass all
characters but did not
nobody can truly leave eve and who in their right
mind would ever biomass 4 100mil sp toons
going over some questions that were askedhow
much do you answer to the upper ranks of pl and
others and how much are you your owna common
misconception people have about horde is that we
ultimately answer to pl truth is i can say what i want
but people will still doubt that this isnUFFFDt the
case and that is fair that was the price we paid when
we decided to call ourselves
UFFFDpandemicUFFFD horde we have a
good mix of pl members who are directors and horde
UFFFDgrownUFFFD directors whose opinion
all matter equally and work together smoothly every
one of those directors ultimately answer to the ceo
gobbins who makes the final decisions if we
canUFFFDt come to a decision however i
canUFFFDt even remembered the last time that
happened for the last 2 years iUFFFDve been
running my own projects inside horde focussing on
new players without negative interaction from pl in
fact a lot of the their experience and views about eve
have helped me tremendously i do not see how
doing the same sort of activities in the csm would
suddenly cause a need to answer to anyone what i
hope is to have people on csm12 with me that
disagree with me because discussions are a good
thing if csm12 is a group that can discuss and argue
with each other and keep an open mind about each
others opinion weUFFFDll be just fine the csm in
my view isnUFFFDt a group that takes a vote and
then pushes an opinion through it should be a group
that discusses and wins each other over finds a
middle ground or agrees to disagree and
communicate both viewpoints to ccp for them to make
the decision will you expect to continue to be able to
do the good work you do if csm takes a fair share of
your time or have you considered handing off
responsibilitiesdelegating work i am passionate
about isnUFFFDt exactly one of my strong suits
and probably one of my biggest weaknesses in terms
of the csm candidacy i put an insane amount of time
into my responsibilities at pandemic horde and it that
regard iUFFFDm going to learn quite a bit this
year the plan if i win in april is as follows i plan to
keep all my current projects running which means i
wonUFFFDt be stepping down as director still be
running nbi and working on our tooling however new
projects will most likely end on someone else his
plate luckily we have plenty of people willing to step
up and take on those challenges that realistically
might still leave me with a shortage on raw time so
additionally iUFFFDm going to do something
iUFFFDve been wanting to do for a while now
which is work less and spend more time on the things
iUFFFDm passionate about or wish to develop
myself into this includes the csm online
communities eve horde and hopefully a bit of pr 
marketing if there is time left
what is your viewpoint regarding faction standings
and as a csm member what changes would you
propose to ccp pertaining to game mechanics for
faction standingsiUFFFDm going to assume you
mean the faction standings towards npcUFFFDs
and the 4 races this isnUFFFDt a subject
iUFFFDm particularly an expert on and would be
something i rather talk to other players and the
community first to see the different viewpoints
everyone has on a lot of these subjects i think my
personal opinion should weigh as much as every
other dude but i do realize that people are curious
where i stand as well i see my role more as someone
representing the views of the community trying to
mediate between polar opposites in the community
and hopefully bring combined feedback and solutions
from those discussions to ccp my personal opinion
would be that factionnpc standings at the moment
mean very little in eve too little with the accidental
removal of needing them for jump clones becoming
permanent this removed yet another reason to have
them as well as npcs that used to give faction
standings no longer being around on the subject of
jump clones specifically i feel they opened the game
up a lot and especially gives newer players a good
benefit so i wasnUFFFDt against that change at
all but it taking another use away for npc standings is
a shame however there arenUFFFDt very many
things that require npc or faction standings any more
besides pve activities ultimately standings should be
just that not a mechanic on itself what should matter
most is the mechanics how you obtain them they
should be fun and engaging standings should be the
negative and positive effects of those those
mechanics but not as it as the moment the goal itself
but rather a side effect of the activities you dothe
means of gathering the npc and faction standings are
considered very boring  tedious for a large group of
players i believe that before you can make standings
mean more weUFFFDll need changes to how
they are obtained at the moment standings are just a
number and unlock some things they
donUFFFDt matter to a large portion of the eve
community i feel what a lot of people want from them
is the universe to change its behavior towards you
based on those standings much beyond not being
able to dock or being chased in highsec home
systems for all of that to happen you need to start at
the core issue which in my opinion would mean
altering how standings are gained the operation
center is coming this year maybe thatUFFFDs an
opportunity to put a bandaid fix on a much larger
problem i do feel at the core eveUFFFDs pve
system needs to get some love for standings to really
shine at a later point again
kalbuir skirate thank you very much for the insightful
reply i like how you see your role as representing the
views of the community to ccp however i think your
assessment that standings donUFFFDt matter to
a large portion of the eve community may be
incorrecti believe faction standings should have
more impact on game play especially since eve

many thanks to declarations of war for their interview
this morning it may have been devastating to my
sleep cycle but it was both enjoyable and
informative
thanks for the interview was fun
you somehow think there is a problem with people
not being save in the early stages of gameplay
teckos showed you an analysis which basically
concludes that people who get blown up are more
likely to join this is very relevantim not sure why
people like you think isolating players for weeks or
months from the real game is somehow something a
real new player is looking for most of them probably
get drawn to eve because the hear about those epic
universe shaping battles and not because they think
its an awesome game to mine in perfect safety so
why are you trying to keep them out of the real
game
yes new players and the point still stands those who
are suicide ganked or even killed legally in their first
15 days stay longer than those who are notthis is a
sandbox a game of spontaneous order and
emergence the idea is that ccp does not control how
people enter into pvp nor do the players always have
control over this that is the fundamental nature of the
gamesorry but there is no nice way to say thisyou
are coming of as an expert who knows what is best
for everyone and youll force everyone to do what you
want because you know bestfor everyone sorry
but i dont accept that view i find it a view of
unbelievable hubris my view is let players explore
the game and learn it as they see fitnot forcing
them all into a onesize fits all experience
google translate eve edition lets do voice recognition
too warp to hek gate aura warping to rancer
it has to tell you that poitot is the only named system
in syndicate every time you enter it
eve nt interview questions posted
 this says it alldone
hiwhat is your view on an option to put corpshares
on the market 
id be for a investment fund and stock exchange i

thanks im glad to hear it was helpfulas i said before
its helped a lot of players who browse the forums
however since evelopedia is no longer active and a
large portion of the playerbase doesnt read the
forums i think access to that info needs to be
somehow incorporated into the game i believe all
players should have the option ingame to gain
diplomatic immunity with the empire factions the fact
that the info pertaining to faction standing repair is
hidden from players ingame is the reason for my

really enjoyed this interview ashterothi at crossing
zebrascsm chat  scylus black  crossing zebras
former executor templis calsf alliance
vote lillik e for csmxii we need your vote
what do you think about ccpls 2nd rorqual nerf and
how would you change null sec mining
i am not surprised by it but on the same note the
proposed changes to panic mode are badly thought
out the easiest fix for the jump hic would to have the
same penalties to ewar as triage and network sensor
arrays havethen there would be no need for this 
must have asteroid targeted sillynessas for the yield
i think it pushes the risk vs reward too far towards
risk for smaller entities to continue using with the
original yield you could repay the full cost of a
rorqual including drones with about 20 hours
miningwith the present yield its closer to 50 hours
and after the patch it will be near 85h constant
mining in order to repay the costs of the ship these
times do not include the time spent re positioning due
to the increased belt spread which will push the
figure out to 120h of mining to repay the initial cost of
a rorqual setupa carrier can repay its initial
investment in 12 hours and is not stuck in the same
place a supercarrier can repay its self in 50 hours
and cannot be tackled by an interceptor so what i
see happening is people moving away from mining
reducing the number of accounts they use and just
ratting for income insteadto improve the general
feeling of double nerf the build requirements of the
excavators could be halfd to reflect their reduced
yield
looks solid 1
probably the most knowledgeable chap i
haveUFFFDencountered in the game he has a
passion for eve and teaching others
smart and mature 1
hi and thanks for the replyi agree with most of what
you wrote except for not having the ability to have
friendly standings with all empire factions i think that
cuts off a lot of available content to players also id
like to point out that pirate faction standings will still
be negative after gaining high standings with empire
factionswhen i gave the faction standing repair plan
to the eve community in the forums it gave players
the knowledge to change their standings and engage
in content they previously couldnt access however
that info isnt readily available ingame and as such a
lot of players are still missing out on accessing
content due to lack of knowledgei think all players
should have the option ingame to invoke diplomatic
immunity with the empire factions the fact that the
info pertaining to that is hidden from players ingame
is the reason for my postanyway thanks again for
the reply and good luck with the electiondmc
i just wanted to stop by and say that i fully endorse
suitonia and he has my vote there can be no better
person to fight for a better eve than this man if i am
going to send anyone to iceland to have face to face
time with the devs it should be this
mancompetentknowledgeableexperienceddoesnt
answer to any ingame entity
i am a kestrel alt and i approve of this campaign
hi it great that votes come round but question is even
though your are logged in it says you just cant vote
even though you have omega account why is that
xenuria i was pleasantly surprised with how well you
did on the csm last term this is why you received my
vote this year and i hope you have the opportunity to
contribute in a similarly positive fashion with the next
csm good luck
never vote for this guy his vision is blobbing dude
has no honor in pvp
how so my vision definitely isnt for blob online and i
dont think i ever advocated for that but i appreciate
the bump friend remember to vote in the elections
id appreciate a slot on your ballot but voting for any
candidate is voting for a better eve
hey steve keep up the great work you got my 1
votes again this year
from alliance tournament exploration to capital fights
i always like to get into new parts of this gameand
yes i have done these things and many more in my
time also have lived in all 3 high low and
nulladditionally the meta and political game around
eve is a whole additional level to get into which is
even more fun with this strongly rooted and
impressive community its a challenging game a
place to explore things to make friends and fight
wars but that makes it also hard to get into i think we
need to make sure that the community can evolve
with new players getting into it and staying for longer
as an alliance brave collective has the goal to help
new players and that is what attracted me to themi
stand behind that but also behind the idea of players
evolving and doing their own thing for that all sides of
the game must be preserved and improved for that i
stand i specifically choose not to have a platform but
come as an allround player with different
experiences who wants to improve the experience for
all and not bump one specific topic as much as the
nda will allow me i want to include you into my
feedback to ccpreddit ama
hi there i am trying to vote for you but your name
doesnt seem to be appearing on the vote page just
thought id inform cheersfrom an nz supporter
hiwhat is your view on an option to put corpshares
on the market 
bump vor vote 
for those of you who i havent yet annoyed in fleets
please allow me to introduce myself im the ludocrat
and im asking for your support in running for csm
2017i joined a nullsec alliance about a year and a
half ago after being a miner an explorer mission
runner and a wormholer at various points in my four
year eve career so farfcon is an amazing community
and through it ive found even more amazing and
diverse group of badasses in the universe at large in
fact youve all inspired me to run for csm so please
vote for mewhy should you well ill advocate your
playstyle always try to be fair to all sides and
perhaps most importantly i promise to work hard to
not only preserve this bizarre game weve come to
know and love but to prepare it for the future
improvements we all know it needs its up to us to do
thisso i humbly ask for your support i may be not the
best pvper most productive miner or widest ranging
explorer but i genuinely care about those playstyles
and the many others available to us in this incredible
place we call new edenok enough of the mushy
stuff please vote the ludocrat for csm
2017sincerelyyour friendly neighborhood
ludocrattldrludo will work for you things will get
better vote for ludo o
kalibuir has been one of the cornerstones of horde
and especially its new player experience i started
playing eve 6 years ago where i quit a few months
later due to bad experiences in null corps especially
for a newbie to null like me i created a new char and
joined horde a few months ago as a day one char
the support system horde has for newbeans is
amazing and made me sub to this game for the
foreseeable future as someone who has a
background in the software industry i believe i can
appreciate all the work that kalibuir had put into
making the horde infrastructure the way it is now the
gobloons system and the new bean initiatives are
great examples i know  without a shade of doubt
that kalibuir would be the perfect candidate for csm
gl kalibuir
updated links to include qa with eventid
appreciate if you added me to your ballot
looks like toxic yaken is
ok i will not try to argue whether i think sucide
ganking or the actions of bumbing intill your fleet
comes along is allowed or not i am not good with
words and pv players will always argue and ccp
wants pvp actions it is simple have a 100 vote in
both alpha and omega accounts 100 of the
accounts for a 30 day period even give some type of
award for voteing and when you give the answer of
who voted on what give the answer of how many 
voted based on how many total accutally voted not
how many total accounts polay eve but ask all the
accounts during that 30 nday period ask how many
players think succide ganking showed be allowed
period put it up to the player base and since ccp
claims that this is a pvp game then the pvp should
vote and win i petrsonally dont think succide ganking
should be allowed what  of the total accounts on
the record for a 30 day period how many accounts
want succide ganking not to be legal of course we
are going to argue whether it will be total accounts
one per account to be allowed to vote or one per real
person no matter how many accounts per that
person ius allowe3d to vote that is another
arguement all together and if some one want to try to
put this in a better describale way go for it i will eve
read it again and tell ya if that is what i mean to say
thanks for reading this and hopefully it will be treated
with seriouness
an yet high sec ganking is still ultimately left in rng
hands as that cargo could self destruct
first off voting sucks it is a terrible way to make
decisions there is nothing to say that voting will give
a good outcome there have been a number of
people who have looked at this link link link link
voting should be analyzed via game theory and one
thing about game theory is that the optimal outcomes
are never ensured so even if the truly optimal answer
is more suicide ganking there is no mechanism in
voting to ensure this is the outcomesecond many
people who are the subject of suicide ganking have
literally zero awareness of what is going on in the
wider game none even when burn jita is announced
weeks ahead even when people are sitting 1 2 or 3
jumps from systems where ganks happenhere
come the freighters fat dumb and often full of
lootmore over even if the vote is more suicide
ganking that will do nothing to stop the whiners
theyll be back here whining about how soandso
was dumb and foolish and put 8 billion isk in his
freighter and clicked undock and flew through
uedama without a scoutadditionally the idea of
voting and imposing a top down solution is
antithetical to the philosophy of the game this is a
game that is an open classless gameie a sandbox
players drive the game if suicide ganking is an
issueplayers should find the solution dont overload
your freighter dont autopillock use a scout tank
your freighter use a webber use standings use
local stop being a doormat and letting everyone walk
all over you jump in a combat ship with some friends
and gank the bumping macherial use your combat
ships to try and shoot the gankers many of whom are
5 or lower in terms of security status if they have kill
rights activate those and shoot themnope by all
means lets vote and remove all that potential content
one last thing gtfo welcome to new eden
its a given it shouldnt be allowed at the price its
allowed today way to easy and risk free not allowed
at all it should be but it should be a gamble and the
empty freighter killing were seeing everyday should
be a rarity only for the very rich
orchestrating a successful freighter gank has a lot
more complexity than just simple f1 smashing when
descending on the target there are logistics people
management ship distribution scouting scanning
warpin positioning bumping etc and that does not
even involve the additional steps and precautions
and adjustments you have to take if ag tries to
interfereto simply state ganking is easy and should
be more complicatedexpensive is not an argument
for anything it is a cheap attempt to misrepresent a
game mechanic in order to make some equally silly
fix seam validthere are tons of really simple game
mechanics like mining in this game which deserve a
lot more attention if you care to make isk acquiring
harder
this is so wildly misleading the benefits that accrue to
suicide gankers are due only and totally to the
foolishness of players balancing the game on players
foolishness and imprudence is just simply idioticoh
and outside of burn events how many empty
freighters are ganked i mean truly empty no double
wrapped courier packagesand yes burn events are
an example of the very rich killing any and all
freighters it is subsidized by goons one of the
richest alliances in game
seriously does anybody think the following is
reasonablesome players are foolish and imprudent
they take huge risks either knowingly or
unknowingly and when it becomes known these
players have taken huge risks other players seek to
take advantage of this this is bad we need to change
the game so that players are protected from their own
foolishness and imprudencesigned every anti
ganker everywhere in game

almost happened to me i was racing a hurricane for
the gate in a itaron 1 in my 4 day old character lucky
no smart bombs
on csm vote youy only get to vote for 1 person per
your account alpha or omegai hate to be stupid but i
cant find the answer
1 vote per omega accountno votes for alphas
because of the massive voter fraud which would
happen
more director level slack leaks tm
special thanks to mindclash for having me on the
show last night with suitonia
i always thought that corp shares were kind of
strange considering they mainly seem exist to control
power over the corporation and create the necessity
for holding corps and i honestly cant think of any
groups actually selling shares to payout
shareholders it seems like a neat idea though i could
see a lot of players using it for exploitation as you
could sell shares for your corporation and then just
fold the corp having better visibility for groups that
legitimately want to seek investments in game would
be cool though and kind of feeds in my hopes for
having a services hub as i mentioned in my platform
happy to have devils on my shoulder 
o7
happy to have your support random also more
highdrag please 3
so whilst running around in my transport ships and
keeping an eye on zkillboard to check out where
hotspots of ganking are i saw this
you get my bullets and my vote
it has always been the case that you win sov most
efficiently by running away from fights this has been
disheartening to many players who have been in
faction war and i believe is the main reason why the
vast majority of eve players think fw is a joke you will
see how people gain sov most effectively by looking
those who get the most vp ie captured the most
plexes for the week or day and then look at how they
fit their ships this website allows you to see who
gained the most vp per day or week
one more campaign thing that im hearing that a lot in
the wormhole community want is better access to ore
belts we do not want the ore belts like they are in
null never dying but we want a larger spawn pool
so for those who enjoy mining they can make more
money and more profitability on it
thanks for offering some views on faction war gorski
never would respond to players and certainly never
responded to me when i was told to talk to him about
fw i realize that allot of people have different views
on fw i actually like the idea of splitting up the war
into 1v1v1v1 for the reasons you give but i dont
think that is the crux of the problem with faction war
the main problem has always been the case that you
win sov most efficiently by running away from fights
this has been disheartening to many players who
have been in faction war and i believe is the main
reason why the vast majority of eve players think fw
is a joke you will see how people gain sov most

aaaaand voted best of luck rhiload  cheering for
ya
still open for questionscomments
do you have any thoughts on changes to moon goo
production t2 industry
same
same here your name is not on the list i was going
to vote for you just for the aspect of highsec events
though i am against your war dec change allowing a
fee payable to concord will effectively kill all wardecs
as everyone will do it if you limit it to corporations
with a low member count as others have suggested
in the ideas and suggestions subforum then that will
get abused to hell and back and we will see a heavy
increase in oneman corporations and less people
will work togetherthe only way i can see that even
remotely working is if you limit the concord bribe to
oncetwice a year that protects them for one month
and then lock all characters in that corp for the whole
year to stop them jumping and creating a new corp to
do it again corp hopping is the bane of war decs
currently which is why everyone gets decced you
dec 25 active 50 member corps and maybe just 8 or
9 people from each corp will log in during that time
out of that 89 maybe half of them will remain in corp
and not leave or create a new corp out of those 4 or
5 remaining active players you may be lucky and
catch one person undocked this is why every tom
 and harry gets wardecced over nothingif you are
going to make any change to the wardec system you
need to see it from the aggressors view first unless
you plan on removing war decs completely its far
too easy to run from a wardec and this leads to
everyone getting wardecced repeatedly just to get the
tiniest amount of content for players a revised
wardec system will need to be built from the ground
up keep the aggressors happy with content give the
defenders an ability to end the war that benefits both
parties not isk related remove corp hopping etc
but then again if corps and alliance just worked
together undocked and fought the mercs instead of
staying docked and crying about griefing then we
wouldnt need to change wardecs

he is not a candidate
we definitely could use more functionality with the
corp shares mechanic right now it feels like corp
shares were introduced with no clear vision as to how
it should be usedin the future i would like to see
development of the corp shares feature along the
lines of actually being a way to value the corporation
that could distribute it execution will be difficult but
moving towards getting corp shares in line with rl
shares as a way to value a company would be great
of course this would mean that it would have to be
tradable and that in and of itself could be an
interesting direction to start moving towardsbefore
we can be in a place where corp shares could be
tradable in the market im afraid well have to
address corp mechanics as a whole first that may be
the greatest technical barrier if ccp is willing to take
on that challenge then i would like to see corp shares
become a tradable commodityeve has so much
potential for meta market play and corp shares is one
example of that potential as a csm candidate i would
like to be there when ccp is ready to take steps
towards that
im curious to know what you think of moon goo
specifically most industrialists in smaller null sec
corps are completely reliant on jita to make any tii in
null do you think there should be changes to make
null sec industrialists less reliant on high sec trade
hubs and allow for corporations to be more self
sufficient if so what are your ideas or how do you
go through the process of getting those ideas
what are you referring to faction warfare standings
faction standings over all with regards to mission
running
                                                       1
my crossing zebras interview
interview with event now live huge thanks to these
guys for not only publishing me but the other
candidates as well
from the handful of podcasts i listen to i have a few
candidates in mind as a fairly casual player im not
familiar with most of the candidates and the amount
of information to sift through to make an informed
decision is immenseim interested in voting for a
candidate that has expertise in industry and nonhigh
sec tradecommerceim willing to do additional
research into your recommendation but i need a little
help sifting through the stackthanks
for nonhighsec industry and commerce id
recommend sullen decimus and erika mizune off the
top of my head
drop me a line buddy would be happy to chat

same ive worked with many
there are plenty of us out there it seems
the verifiable data zkill shows the above to be
bullshite the majority of ganks of freighters appear to
be empty or near empty the weapon of choice
stealth bombers often costing more than the empty
or near empty freighter not many have plastic
wrapdisagree go check zkiilllol ganking a freighter is
so easy some are multiboxing it again go check zkill
but im sure you already know thismining 
missioning takes actual risk they undock in valuable
ships at least on their mains and have to deal with the
constant threat of 40 year old preteens who appear to
think theyre irl actual space pirates and devs who
have no idea how to manage the game or decipher
pie charts  yeah that big slice with 90 on it thats
your potential pve subscriber base the 9 is pvp
and the 1 or less are wan gankers
there are maybe one or two guys in the entire game
who are even able to multibox large numbers of gank
chars to kill freighters to call something easy just
because one guy is doing it successfully is just
blatant trolling and has nothing to do with a real
argumentthey are also not the ones who kill empty
freighters as you can see quite clearly on zkill kusion
as an example there isnt probably any other
anyway almost exclusively hits valuable shipsthe
only reason why empty freighters are killed are big
events like burn jita where people just gank
everything for entertainment big fleets with many
people where you need to provide content to keep
fleet cohesionthose are very good reasons and
unavoidable once you realise that eve is actually
played by people and they are here for
entertainment 20 people will not sit in station for
hours just to wait for that one big 20bil isk
fishhighsec is so safe it probably takes less time to
research how to make your chosen profession
gankproof than it took you to write this troll post ccp
provided all the tools to make mining missioning and
hauling so save you are almost completely
untouchable a good pve player has absolutely
nothing to fear from a ganker since he can
completely avoid them with some simple steps which
are pretty obvious and well knownthe only people
who get ganked are people who are foolish and
imprudent and dont invest any effort at all to protect
their ships or belongings it is not ccps job or in any
interest of the game to protect people who are simply
just bad at the game especially since this is a
multiplayer sandbox which even promotes and
encourages piracy gameplay
show your data ive gone and looked and there are
damn few i can find that are truly empty i found 2 that
were truly empty but 1 was a war dec the other was
not a dec based on the ships used in the kill i looked
at obelisks from march 5feb 28i can only conclude
you are a liar
so according to you its both extremely hard to set up
a gank and only foolish over loaders of cargo get
ganked and at the same time gankers gank empty
freighters out of boredom also in lalaland single
pilots multibox freighter ganks not because its easy
but because they are amazing and your fleets with 15
to 80 players depending on sec status still find it
extremely taxingtime to get back to reality anything
that can be multiboxed by a single player is trivial for
a fleet
there are only a couple of people who are even able
to multibox ganks on the level that you are able to
gank freighters also that multiboxing has limits and
even kusion cant gank properly tanked freighters
you need a fleet of peopleits not really an argument
to just call it easy just because someone is able to
do it especially if it is pretty obvious that only a
handful of player in the entire game is able to do it at
all while for everyone else it is completely out of
reachthe reason why you do it anyway is quite clear
it is well known that you are in favour of completely
removing nonconsensual pvp from highsec and you
somehow think to label the profession as easy
without showing any evidence will convince someone
it is in need of more nerfsfleet pvp and solo pvp are
two completely different things the game mechanics
are the same but the real challenge of a fleet is not
the game mechanics or the difficulty of a certain job
but the people skills of the fc which has to hold it all
together and coordinate the other players this is far
from trivial and only a hand full of people are really
good at it
what empty freighters aside from burn events where
are we seeing this you keep saying this but i dont
see much evidence of it
im a new player  inb4 who does this noob think he is
having an opinion  but im looking at making a corp
and as much as i can make a cool name because
there are a million ways to write something with so
many characters available the ticker is really
annoying me that i cant have the acronym for my
corp i have tried several different corp names in an
attempt to find a unique ticker but have come up
spades i suggest we reopen this discussion as
found here

that ganking is a legitimate style of game play as ccp

dangerous for the ganker in the 30 of new eden

consider to make highsec ganking more difficult and
less profitableregardscochise chiricahua
good day cochisei understand where youre coming
from and totally get the frustration level of hisec
ganking from a game play perspective ccp wants to
see no where in eve as being 100 safe just a
scaled level of risk ganking is an activity that pits the
risk vs reward mechanic against a players initiative
and planning and i really think it needs to stay in the
game as you even state there are player driven anti
gank squads up and running to try and counter this
game play which adds even more complexity to the
world of eve to speak plainly my stance is that
ganking is in an ok spot right now with a few minor
areas that can and probably should be adjusted let
me explainfor one there is still a lot to be said for
disrupting or delaying concord response time some
groups will use tactics that are intended to disrupt or
stop concord from responding to a gank attempt in a
timely manner and this is something i would like to
see addressed with ccp i also am willing to present
the ideas you mentioned to the csm and ccp and
have a more robust discussion regarding this topic to
see if there are any areas of the game mechanics
that are being abused or that can be tweaked to allow
for a better game play experience claevyan
thank you all for your kind words and
recommendations and hopefully your votes as well
if you have any further questions let me know id be
happy to answer them also i just put out csm xis last
quarterly review which contains some of the
thoughts of us on both the past term and the ongoing
election im also happy that the csm podcast hosted
by apothne has been able to hit its stride this time
with third episode up i really hope were able to
continue this into the csm 12 term

first of all as you might have seen i ran a highsec
ganking roundtable and am familliar with the
concerns of both sides i think that right now perma
bumping is the most degenerate part of that
mechanic as it is the definition of gamebreaking the
only way to counter a bumper is with another
bumper however bumping in and of itself is a
needed mechanic as it gives a way for the actual
interaction to take place as such ive talked to fozzie
about the idea he presented last fanfest of ships
entering warp after a given amount of time spent
bumping off things in detail understanding how it
might be implemented and what issues it would
present in other areas of the gamei think that the
idea youve presented would make logical inuniverse
sense however given the way that the mechanics of
eve function with regards to crimewatch that would
be hillariously difficult to implement as the flag is
given by the action of looting not the cargo itself in
addition to this the csm is not a junior game
development and whilst yes we could champion an
idea ccp is very very unlikely to actually implement
it and i can say that from having made that mistake
in my current term so no i wouldnt push it however
i have been willing to talk to both sides this term and
discuss what their main issues are and how they
operate so that if ccp wants to know about how either
side works and what they do or if i spot an
opportunity to touch on a qol benefit for either side ill
take it at the end of the day its difficult to make
ganking dangerous as its a mathematically solved
problem without the interaction with players that the
hisec militia provides or introducing some form of
hard rng into the game which i find to be inherently
uneve i find many people use it as an obfuscating
term for making ganking harder as they feel its too
easy and perhaps thats a valid stance but i dislike
the way its presented in that manner i  and both the
gankers and antigankers ive talked to  feel that
introducing more room for interaction on the ganker
and antiganker side would improve the overall
experience for both sides of the law and the
potential victim still im always open for reasoned
discussion here so feel free to present any counter
arguments you have 
i can no longer fit any more links in my original post

let me sneak in here for a bitrantas someone who
ships billions a month i would like the warzones
between empires to be extended no continues
highsec between the major trade hubs at least 12
low sec hops on each high waythen the highsec
ganking on traderoutes would be a whole other
discussion and local tradehubs would be boomingas
for mining the bulk of mining volumes is centered in
certain systems in eve see the regional economical
reports by ccp quant the people mining there ask to
be gankedin a game where everything is based on
risk vs reward people should understand that it is
stupid to mine in systems with huge number of
people with mining equipment go mine in khanid or
korazor and you are the king of the ore belts saying
you want to mine in highsec in the first place no
gankers in the whole constellationplease mine
smarter not more political correctend rant
schrUFFFDdingers missile i dig it  makari
aeron
so here is my thoughts so keep in mind ive been
ganked my fair share ganking is mostly preventable
in a few ways 1 move less value at 1 time2
webbing alts3 mining in scarcely populated
systems4 other ways possiblenow is it particularly
engaging gameplay when it happens no is it fun 
for the aggressor yes for defence its more or less a
suprize colonoscopy and has and does cause people
to quit eve thats the scope in which my opionion is
formed now its been nerfed several times and i think
freighters are roughly where they need to be on the
risk vs reward balancethe existance of counter play
is nessesary and i think it would be better to look at
unlimited bumping and setting a limit to it vs making a
major change again to ganking

hey cochisethank you for your post  let me try to
answer itburn jita is basically an operation to kill
supply lines that gets out of hand massively during
this yearly event you should try to think of it in that
frame to formulate your response  and i think your
reaction was the best one an eve player could have
had they gank you protect there are whole groups
going to jita during the event with logis to rep random
people up or hunt the gankersdo i help out players
who got ganked from time to time mostly ones who
obviously put all their belongings into a freighter and
lost it and are relatively new cause it hurts just to
see the killmail i think ganking is part of the game
which i can fight against ingame  content and it
has been nerfed in the last years to tone it down i
would definitely look at it to try and find a balance
between haulers and gankers  something that lets
prepared haulers hold out until concord arrives from
time to time but also something that does not totally
break this playstylei think that your proposal is
definitely something i will keep in mind hope that
clears up a bit where i standinteresting viewpoint
from the gankers side know your enemy

it wasnt faction police that killed him it was faction
navy different thing you get attacked by them for
bad faction standings not bad sec status and you do
get a popup warning when you try jumping into
hghsec while under 50 secof course ther could be
a separate popup for jumping into hostile imperial

thank you for taking the time to post in my thread
and by the looks of it in lots of other threads too
there cannot be enough engaging of the candidates
to encourage debatewhich information did you read
i asked which information you read because i
addressed and posted the subject of high sec
ganking in my opening post in this thread i also
included links to where i talked about it in more detail
in my campaign threads last year and the year
before and on my seldom used blog as it happens
high sec ganking is one of the most important themes
for meas you say you read the information i
posted but obviously you are still unclear on where i
stand do you have any specific questions about what
i wrote that i could help you withi was proud to have
been the csmx candidate endorsed by the anti
ganking community and channel especially proud
because i did not actively court them but dedicated
members read through all the relevant candidates
and decided that i was as close to a candidate that
represented what they felt they helped me come in
15th place in the election sadly people in high sec
have been losing interest in the csm since thenand
there was me thinking that you read what i
wrotebefore i get any further have you tried high
sec ganking do you have an idea how difficult and
dangerous it already is see campaign thread 1
back when i was the antiganking candidate for some
discussion on this
thanks for the correction what gets on my nerves is
that some things are completely babysat i get
warnings when i accept a distribution mission if the
cargo does not fit in my active ship i get warnings
when i try undocking without the cargo on my ship 
no really and other things are not by having so
much babysitting it is hard for carebears to know
what gets warned and what doesnt and it leads to a
false unfair sense of security i mean if the game
warns me that i am undocking without cargo it warns
me when concord are going to turn off my engines
and blap me why wouldnt it warn me that the navy
are going to fry mei would plead for consistency
partial babysitting is not fun from my perspective
this is the core of my candidacy i have no illusions
about the challenges ahead my role as i see it is to
bring transparency and accountability to the position
which means over communicating with the
community and partnering with ccp and my csm
colleagues to advance our change requestsfw cant
remain on the cutting room floor as a dedicated fw 
low sec representative that would not happen with
me on the csm teamashterothi  endorsting me
2ndhe sums up why i am the fw  low sec candidate
if you have not heard my interview with him the first
7 minutes of this feedback from him will shed some
light we need to be a united front to get to the tablei
look forward to serving you former executor templis
calsf alliance
nice yes very excited about all of this if the teams
feel that i can be the voice this will work its not
about being an expert in an eve mechanic its about
being an expert in relationships and having integrity
something i do and have everyday we can be heard

eve is a sandbox game expect to get dusty in all
secs every time you undock you consent to pvp
including in highsec i have an alt in redfrog freight i
know that one day my hauler will be ganked its part

i encourage you to sit on what needs to be done to
successfully suicide gank something if youre not
flying an untanked t1 hauler theres a lot of math
planning and execution that already needs to go into
it before the first f1 press i think its totally reasonable
as it stands right now in that regard for example
ganking something like a freighter takes planning
and coordination by upwards of 3040 ships so that
dealing with concord happens at the right point and
everything like that on top of that it is quite
dangerous for the ganker they 100 lose their ship
guaranteed and if they find some way around it its a
bannable exploit so while i sympathize with your
plight of flying a hauler and occasionally getting
ganked i offer you some counter play1 train your
character to fly t2 haulers dsts are awesome boats in
highsec and its not uncommon to find people hauling
in them will a billion in loot they are quite tanky for
their size buffer tanked impels for example can
break 100k ehp and can still haul very fast if you
know what you are doing pulse mwd and warp shut
off mwd when the cycle ends you go into warp and
it warps faster than most battleshipson the flipside
to the dst the blockade runner while not having the
immense cargo hold that the dst has it has incredible
speed and you cant be cargo scanned what this
means is that if someone is going to gank you they
wont be able to tell whether youre carrying 1 carbon
or 100 plex and in highsec as long as youre not afk
piloting youre very unlikely to be caught the only
places i tend to see blockade runners getting ganked
is on trade station undocks which can be fixed by
burning an instawarp location for when you leave
station you take a fast ship undock hit prop mod go
get a drink go to the bathroom come back and
bookmark where the ship is using it you undock and
immediately rightclick and warp to bookmark and
youre typically off the undock within 24s of
undockingi get that you want to see members of the
ganking community punished but the idea of giving
criminal flags for people who scoop the loot off a
destroyed hauler like that is just silly what if
someone who was fast and on the ball scooped the
loot from the ganker why should they suffer for
being able to be faster than someoneoverall i
honestly feel like this mechanic is already in a very
stable place and should work out well as is i would
not propose anything like this to ccp or push for any
major changes at this point regarding changing how
ganking works in highsec there is a lot that goes into
it a lot of effort and planning more than lololololololol
f1 die nub and the people who successfully pull this
off should be given a chance to get a reward for their
effortsim sorry if this isnt the answer that you want
to hear but i believe ccp has is right eve is hard
learn from your mistakes get better plan better and
then succeed

thanks for the response i definately aim to keep
communication open as much as possiblei am
certainly open to the idea of rollbacks and think that
they would be an improvement over what we have
now my only concern with rollbacks is that it may
allow pirate groups and outside forces influence and
defend fw space i like an alternative idea of speeding
up reverse progress by say 4xfor example a typical
fw farmer is in a novice he has gotten the 10 minute
timer down to 5 minutes a pvp player from the
opposite faction warps in and he warps off the pvp
player now reverses his 5 minutes progress by 4
seconds every 1 second he is there undoing his 5
minutes of progress in 125 minutes i feel like this
encourages people to fight creates a sense of
urgency and also prevents people from reshipping to
hard counters because if they do they lose their
progress while preventing outside forces like pirate
groups and unaffiliated pilots from influencing the
warzone as much regarding real time intel i think
adding in a live intel log about recently captured
plexes would be a great idea to help players find
content and defend plexes you can already compare
the contested  on the api every 15 minutes if you
use a 3rd party tool but this is not available to
everyone would be nice to have a recently captured
plex option on the map as well as a log in the fw ui
listing the last 20 captured plexes and maybe
suppressable fw noticiations that militia pilots can
have that send notifications whenever a plex is
captured in a friendly system i will certainly ask ccp
about undelivered fw features and encourage them to
revamp fw since i think its an important aspect of the
npecontributer to eve is easy

not really a question but i think you should bug ccp
to introduce a hotkey for applying nanite paste to
repair modules damaged from overheating should
be ala overheating itself for example shiftkeypress
startsstops module overheat controlkeypress could
startstop nanite repair for the same module or
whatever you bind it to
yes this would be great in regards to nanite paste id
also like to see cost to repair when you mouse over
a damaged module we have a visual grey circle
when its being repaired but it would be nice when
youre repairing a module it has an actual timer on it
like when reloading when you mouse over the
repairing module it would also be nice if you could
attempt to do a partial repair in several instances ive
had experiences where i had 100 or so paste but my
guns are damaged it would be nice if i could just
repair them to the level that i can do with my paste
instead of it completely failing instead i have to
ungroup my guns and apply cancel half way through
and repeat which is annoying contributer to eve is
easy
thanks for the responsethe intel tool would need to
let pilots know where timers are being run before the
plex is captured  or the purpose is defeated after
they are captured its too late to defend them i am not
really sure why we would weaken the rollbacks to
only work for militias a very sizable percent of people
in plexes are not in militias so this would insulate
rabbit plexers from them i am not sure why we would
want to do that also i am not sure why a pvper
should have to stay in the plex for it to roll back again
it just seems to weaken the rollback effect but any
rollback is better than no rollback i just question
whether this weakened rollback alone will be enough
to make it so you win sov by fighting rather than by
running away its interesting that you refer to fw as
part of the npe im not exactly sure what defines the
new player experience but how ever we define it is
fine i suppose my experience is that corporations like
the one you are in now tend to give far more
guidance to new players than any fw corp i have
joined do you think fw should be more in the npe
than null secmake faction war occupancy pvp
instead of pve
if the majority of players pvping in fw space are not in
militias maybe thats a problem in itself maybe what
im describing is not a problem i just like to play
devils advocate and seek out alternative suggestions
as its often the best way to get discussions going fw
gives players rewards if they dont get a fight in a
ideal situation you either get a fight or if you get
blueballed you make money given the plex
mechanics insulating ship types fights taking place in
static environments and a metagame with little
evolution its probably the easiest pvp to get into i
dont think the fw should be refocused or changed to
be more npe i just think fw is usually the place where
people who get bored of pve and want to try pvp end
up looking firstthe instant intel thing seems like it
could be a bit too strong and way too spammy as
someone just checking a plex would spam the intel
and you wouldnt get too much use from it you need
to capture 150 plexes to take a system from 0 to
100 anyway so its not like someone can surprise
flip a system again if this is something fw players
are deadset on im happy to take it up i just think
ccp will be very hesitant with this because of their
recent focus on active scouting for intel with sov
entosis nodestimers astrahus vulnerability timers
etc plex captured is already in the game as an
option if you use api toolscontributer to eve is easy
one of the things that i want changed with fw is the
way you deplex deplexing can be one of the most
boring uninteresting and disengaging things in eve
you just sit there for 20 minutes at time in some
cases babysitting an npc yes sometimes there are
fights but for the most part many players that i talk
to have no enthusiasm for deplexing they just want
to get out there and blow  up at least with
oplexing you get to blow up an npc ship once in
awhile but i find it hard to motivate my corp mates to
deplex when we need to deplex a system it sounds
like a chore to them and thats definitely not what
playing a game is about however if we dont deplex
well lose our system and our assets will get locked
inside the station so its one of those grinds that you
just have to do

hello chochiseso heres the deal i do not believe
there is anything wrong with the current set of
mechanics related to ganks in hisec i will cover this
in a few different waysi lose a lot of ships i have lost
so much isk and ships in ways that are retrospectively
silly beyond question and show nothing but
hilariously poor judgement and lack of situational
awareness however on any of my characters i have
never lost a freighter or jump freighter theres a
reason for this  taking even the most basic
precautions makes them extremely hard to gank
some people lose them yes but considering how
successful red frogblack frog are when they are
dedicated professionals to this aspect of the game
and how rarely they lose one it speaks volumes
about both rewarding specialization and how safe
you really can be in those ships i spend a surprising
amount of time in freighters the hull hp buff was
incredible too they have already given freighters a
huge buffwhen they rebalanced t1 industrials they
went nuts you are basically ungankable in hisec as
it is if youdont autopilotuse the ample fitting they
give you to have some tank some can take 2 or
more tornado vollies easilyuse instantundocks and
instantdock bookmarksuse a webbing altuse a
scoutmost of the complaints about hisec are born
out of unfamiliarity with mechanics and expectation of
safety you generally can only be ganked if you let
yourself be ganked you should try it from the other
side perhaps on an alt  it will really give you a
sense of not making yourself a target if you want to
beat the gankers dont get caught and teach your
fellow hisec residents how to stay safe there is
nothing more frustrating in hi low or null than trying
to hunt smart targets

hi chandice rantel of pandemic horde inc thank you

hi stevewhat is your opinion on gankingwhich one
of those three statements is close to your position
1 danger level in highsec is just right2 life is too
easy for gankers we need more security in
highsec3 highsec dwellers are too lazy and
complacent we need to make highsec more
dangerouspslove your indy tools thanks
pretty much 1 i would like to see bumping being
adjusted mostly because being bumped for 30
minutes just doesnt feel right but other than that
fine

the main problem i can see with the loot is that itll be
hard to maintain a stolen flag on a stack right now
the only thing which is maintained is the number
then what happens when you merge it with another
stack or split the stacks and how long does it last
its a nice idea in principle but im not sure how
practical it isthe main change i want to see is with
long term bumping so at least the people doing the
ganking have to sacrifice a warp scramblerdisruptor
fit ship every so often if they want to bump a freighter
for 30 minutes
2 for all your hard work dont give it up

edit wtf happened there delete this plz mods
i think npc standings as they currently pertain to
anything besides agents is just an enormous
inconvenience without adding any real flavour to the
game for example once being exposed to it the vast
majority of people liked the removal of the need to
have 80 faction standings to use jump clone services
in an npc station id like to see faction police
removed for much the same reasons if you spent a
few months in faction warfare or maybe running null
sec level 4s theyre just a hassle thatll follow you
round for the rest of your eve career unless you put a
bunch of effort into fixing them for someone like me
who has a ton of alts its not really a big deal but i
can imagine knowing the repercussions of this would
put a lot of newer players off from trying out those
otherwise fun activities
thanks for the replypersonally i think faction
standings should have a more meaningful impact on
game play especially since eve online is based on
having a balance in risk vs reward and actions vs
consequences thats what makes this game great in
the past characters were accountable for their
actions now most everything is being dumbed down
and turned into easy mode for the instant gratification
crowd thats something i dont want to see happen to
faction standings currently the ingame aspects of
faction standings positive faction standings are the
only way to access cosmos agents one time
accesspositive faction and corporation standings
are needed to access research agentsall other
agents only require minimal amount of faction
standing for access 200 or higher standinghigh
faction standings reduce market broker fees and
reprocessing fees in npc stationsat 500 or lower
faction standing empire npcs will attack when in
their spacein my opinion ccp made a big mistake
when they removed the need to have positive faction
standings to anchor pos in high sec space having
that requirement made faction standings mean
something more instead of just a way to access
agents or to get lower broker fees now i would love
to see more content pertaining to positive faction
standings be added to the game however at this
time my inquiry is based on the negative effects of
faction standings to the playerbase since it takes
time for players to ruin their faction standings then it
should also take some time to repair those standings
unfortunately that info is basically nonexistent in
game when it should actually be readily available and
easily understood by playersi created and shared the
faction standing repair plan with the playerbase on
the forums back in 2010 over the past 7 years it has
helped countless amount of players to rectify what
seemed like an unsolvable issue in my opinion
players need more options available to repair
negative faction standings then what ive listed in that
guide in fact most of those event agents can only be
accessed once in the characters life theres a lot of
players ingame who dont read the forums and dont
know that guide exists theyve basically accepted the
fact theyre cut off from engaging in available content
due to negative faction standings repairing negative
standings is a big task even for experienced players
who are familiar with the plan new players who
havent learned the game yet can easily mess up
their faction standings without even knowing it right
from the start resulting in no access to half of empire
spaceanyway i think all players should have the
option ingame to gain diplomatic immunity with the
empire factions the fact that the info pertaining to
faction standing repair is hidden from players in
game is the reason for my post after 7 years of
helping players in the forums to repair negative
faction standings i just wanted to provide some
feedback through the csm for ccp to consideri

right guys i apologise for being late and missing the
last few responsesdemichael crimson  in short i
believe that faction standings need to have more
ways to obtain them plus they need to be used in
more cases to gain advantages especially after the
loss of their use recently in situations such as jump
clonescochise chiricahua  so i would certainly say
that ganking is a legitimate style of play that can
spice stuff up in hisec i would certainly like to see
some more challenge come to it afterwards like
picking up the loot as you suggested after all they
are helping partake in said criminal activity if i was a
member i would certainly raise ideas like this its a
fairly decent one plus it allows for more counterplay
from people on the otherside obviously i couldnt
guarantee that it is adopted due to how csm works
but i would certainly push more more mechanics that
spice stuff up the only thing i would say is that i
wouldnt want to neuter the gameplay behind
ganking

from the start resulting in no access to half of empire
spaceanyway i think all players should have the
option ingame to gain diplomatic immunity with the
empire factions the fact that the info pertaining to
faction standing repair is hidden from players in
game is the reason for my post after 7 years of
helping players in the forums to repair negative
faction standings i just wanted to provide some
feedback through the csm for ccp to consideri
believe these options would definitely help all players
ingamefaction standing repair process be
implemented ingame and be very intuitive not
obscure tutorial perhapschanges to faction
standings will notify players with on screen pop up
message option to deactivateactions that would
cause negative faction standing trigger on screen
pop up warning option to deactivateall antiempire
mission briefings have a warning informing players
those missions will incur negative faction
standingsimplement tags for empire standings in
game based on similar game mechanics as tags for
securityadd npc agents to ingame agent finder for
faction standing repair similar to proposal in my
forum signatureonce again good luck with the
upcoming electiondmc

stand on highsec ganking iUFFFDll concede
that ganking is a legitimate style of game play as ccp

dangerous for the ganker in the 30 of new eden

i have collaborated with this guy several years and i
must say there is no better candinate for same
idealogy what he hashe has ideas what is possible
to chance in this game and he has right
perspectiveand all of that he likes good wiskey if
nothing else there is good reason to vote this guy 
this is actually really interesting topic and as usual
there is really strong opinions towards both
directions as basis i think no place in eve should be
truly safe docked in station is acceptable there
should always be chance that you are killed in a pod
next to jita to some random guythat said i think the
experience in high sec could be enhanced a lot
looking it from outlaws point of view i think you
should have thrill to work as an outlaw you would be
denied from stations but you could use outlaw
citadels like pirate npcs have in missions to trade
and do your operations i would like to find better
ways and reasons to smuggle some outlawed goods
maybe using wormholes or pirate gates and all stuff
like thaton the other side i think there should be
interesting and working ways to protect your self from
a gank or pirate ships were that concord faction
police or other players for example one thing that
was strange to me is that ship can bump you as long
as it likes and there is no way to mark him as criminal
and manual marking wouldnt work so your friends
could kill or just web himi presume the point of
thomas idea is that you cant loot the wreck with one
ship and then move it to another ship so its safe from
suspect timers for that purpose i think that idea
could work and be implementable via assembled item
attributes one would get rid of the suspect flag from
the items once they are repackaged in stationso for
sure i could bring it up when talking about hi sec
andor ganking of course keeping in mind how much
csm can affect this at least this is area that requires
more talking about and i think there is a lot we could
do to make hi sec more interesting for both
sidesediti also think there is good chance to
introduce some changes to hi sec in near future as
far as i know ccp affinity at least is interested of
making faction standings to mean more in good and
bad and thus i think there is other aspects that need
to be looked too using factions to help you like in
mining operations is one interesting idea that could
help to balance things out

greetings spacersiUFFFDm officially running for
csm and wanted to start a thread so that people can
ask question of me iUFFFDve been playing eve
for almost 4 years now during that time
iUFFFDve played in hisec nullsec lowsec and
wormhole space my two main twos are alive in very
different space one is a solid worm hole character
living in a c5 the other is a lowsec character i use
for industry mining and occasional pvp fun some of
the key things i hope to help ccp with isindustry
rework UFFFD ccp recently done a lot of stuff to
help this but i think there still gaps corporate
interface UFFFD this could use some attention
the current title  role system is complex and needs
clean upalpha accounts UFFFD ccp needs to be
able to give better information during creation or
allow some of cross group skills since new players
donUFFFDt know enough to select their choice
please feel free to ask me questions

open for questions  press events throughout the
voting period and after
hello commander azei read your ama and agree that
pi needs an overhaul so you have my vote as
someone who identifies as a high sec candidate
what are your thoughts on keeping timepoor and
casual players operating in highsec engaged and
retained 
i agree with much of what dmc has to say and your
suggestion of tags for faction repair has value to
corrrect seriously negative faction
standingshowever standings are still important to
pve play over and above just not getting shot by the
naviesin addition to tags for standings repair can
you push for agents where you can run missions or
do tasks to gain positive faction standings without
negative standings for the other factions other than
l4 epic arcsthese may require more effort or lower
rewards to be balanced but it would save situations
ie thukker where it is near impossible to ever pull
back from an early mistake as they have a negative
relationship to just about everyonethanks ps you
have my vote
make eve great again  you got my vote
so im part the pve revamp they are working on is a
huge part of this additionally creating new and more
interesting missions and content that scales for more
people could be alot of fun
so there is a huge opportunity here for selecting
mission types that a person is willing to accept i think
making filters on pve content optional ones like
turning away burner missions and missions that dont
effect faction standings or positively effect faction
standings or even that you only want to go against
certain factions would be beneficial for instance
there are 2 missions i will literally quit for the day if i
get buzzkill and the assault both missions suck for
different reasons but would be nice to filter out also i
want more incursions of different types this will
create new fun ways to make isk while creating a
challenge for new and old players with hopefully
some ship losses as always im willing to hear out
any ideas or refine these
for more infos or questions there is also twitter
for the first few months of playing eve online all i did
was mine i rarely communicated didnt try to learn
new aspects of the game or explore possibilities for
the future and eventually code came along and
blew up my new mackinaw for a lot of players this is
breaking point but for me it was a turning point i still
credit that gank as the single most important turning
point for my eve experience as it broke me from the
grinding of mining to actually go out and see what the
greater game had to offernow i use ganking as my
main source of income and generally target haulers
and small ships carrying way too much loot near the
trade hubs to keep my fun going its a playstyle that i
love even though i know so many hate itpersonally
ive always disliked that trick of looting using fleet
hangars though i expect making that change
wouldnt be addressed by ccp unless there were a
larger overarching rework being done to crimewatch
as its kind of a small issue thats part of a niche
gameplay and would require a look both at
crimewatch and looting mechanics im pretty sure
that the current csm has already made ccp aware of
this issue after the ganking roundtables last falli will
direct you to the idea i shared with dracvlad when he
asked me a couple of weeks agoagain this was just
a rough idea i tossed out to give you an idea of where
im coming from i would like to see more
opportunities for interaction with gankers without
significantly breaking our playstyle keep in mind
though the csm has no direct power to make any
kind of changes if you have any suggestions or
thoughts i would be happy to hear them also if i
could be unbanned from antiganking so i could come
talk in there about stuff like this i would appreciate
that as well thanks for the questiontoxic

i have been doing wardecs on and off for a few years
and i agree that some changes needs to be made
and so far i apreciate quite a few of your suggestions
including other on topicsyou got my ballot
appreciate the support if you ever feel like chatting
about wars hit me up or check out the wardec project
discord in my signature
cochise thank you for posting this to answer your
question i agree with the change you proposed
however i would not be presenting this to ccp heres
why and how i could help a more highsec equipped
candidate present it1 my platform is laser focused
on low sec pvp and faction warfare so i need to
ensure i am not distracted by all the other game
mechanics that need to be tweaked for us in low sec
 faction warfare we have a real opportunity to be
heard and i need to ensure all the factions have that
voice with me its all about integrity2 however i am
equipped to help one of the other csm candidates that
are focused on high sec this is done by partnering
with my csm colleagues and helping them advance
their agenda at the ccp table by being a voice of
reason and supporting their argument as a valid
change that would help high sec which we all know is
the gateway for low and null it would behoove me to
support thati hope that sheds light on how i can be of
value and remain integral to the goals i am running
foro7scylus former executor templis calsf alliance
i saw this first and didnt read the rest
make wormholes great again
voted with 8 chars
im thinking of sending votes your way because i think
you have good grasp on the role of the csmwould be
interested in seeing a reply to the email from cochise
above before i do soalso coming from melbourne
myself i need some assurance you are not an
essendon afl supporter
over the term of csm xi we managed to conduct a
ganking round table with both the ganking and anti
ganking communities we managed to get a lot of
useful input that we took to ccp at the first summit
this included the kind of changes mentioned by
cochise and many others on both sides of the
fenceim not one to pander to the masses to gain
votes so im just going to tell it how it is the question
cochise posed is a bit of a loaded one the csm can
make proposals float ideas and discuss topics with
ccp what we dont do is push for a changes
adoption or make changes if the question is do you
listen the answer is obviously yes i cant promise
changes will come within csm xiis term and i cant
say they wont thats up to ccp devs not the csmi
barrack for hawthorn for the record
personally ganking is too cheap too easy being
able to kill billion isk ships with 300m worth of throw
away ships with no significant drawbacks is a bit too
overpowered it has made it less safe to be in
highsec than nullsec with haulers i am unsure how
to counter this other than maybe hiring an npc escort
party to try and protect you from hostiles but this
wont stop the kill

i agree its worthwhile to discuss these issues and sort
it out i have not heard anyone say it is a problem to
have more neutrals than fw guys pvping in fw space
but lets say that it is the problem for whatever
reason the way to fix it would be to make the pvpers
want to join fw why dont they join rabbit plexing is
ridiculous but if you dont do it you will lose your
system and be locked out so any measures that
reduce rabbit plexing would probably help also you
have more targets when you can shoot both militias
making fw 1v1v1v1 would help with this quite a bit
but also if being in the militia meant that you had
access to a real time intel tool that let you know what
plexes were attacked those who like to pvp in fw
plexes would have a big reason to join fw instead of
staying neutral more on that belowok so there are 2
questions 1 do most players go to null sec or fw or
low sec neutral to start pvp 2 where should ccp
direct them if they are going to direct themdo you
think allot of the people in karmafleet used to be in
faction war i would think more people go to null sec
and probably should go to null sec first itUFFFDs
true that plexes help you wittle down engagements
but that is still not as easy as being in the blob being
in large null sec blobs seems the easiest pvp to have
also the gate camping with bubbles and no gate guns
seems pretty easy as well but again i think it
depends on the person i think they are both options
but i really dont think either should be shaped based
on how new players will like them i think they should
both offer very different types of play so eve can
things that appeal to a wide range of people ok first
as far as spam i think one approach would be to
have it work through a map interface that way there
would be no spam so for example it could give a
blue number of the number of friendlies running
plexes in a system and a red number for the number
of enemies running plexes in a system it would be
great if you could easily set desto from this tool
some other possibilities would be to have a tool that
shows intel based on the number of jumps from your
current position it could give more in depth intel such
as the type of plex being run novice small medium or
large again no spam now you say it might be too
strong i agree it would be a strong tool that is why i
think allot of people who like to pvp in plexes would
want to join a militia in order to get it this will mean
that more pvpers are suddenly showing up at these
plexes and getting more and more pvp i think this
combined with a rollback UFFFD maybe even a
relatively weak one like you propose would turn fw
into a bloodbath which would be awesome so what
problem are we trying to solve the problem is that fw
sov is most efficiently won by running away the api
information i gave is the proof of that no one is going
to care about a sov system when sov is won by
running away so people by and large
donUFFFDt care about fw sov with intel the
rabbits can still run but they cant hide and the
rollbacks will make rabbit plexing even less efficient
this will almost certainly put rabbit plexing out of
business now you say people canUFFFDt
capture a system quickly thatUFFFDs true but
whether fast or slow plexing is only fun when there is
pvp UFFFD otherwise it is just a grind so yes i
will see my system has been plexed after i went to
sleep and now i can sit in a defensive plex and get it
back but if no one shows up to fight that is horribly
boring and a reason why people leave fw what
needs to happen is ccp needs to provide mechanics
where more plexes are fought over then winning a
plex becomes an accomplishment and not a grind
letting pilots know where plexes are being taken so
they can fight over them is an obvious step to making
that happen as far as ccp wanting people to do more
scouting i can only say it is not happening with fw fw
players are not going to start scouting when so many
are just rabbits people stopped caring about it
itUFFFDs sort of a chicken and egg issue its
been years and players donUFFFDt scout for this
stuff ccp needs to provide the players the tools to
ignite the spark again they shouldnUFFFDt think
players are suddenly going to start caring about this
broken sov system enough to scout out where the
plexes are the system needs better intel tools and
rollbacks ccp and the players understood this before
and ccp promised both but then ccp went silent and
never delivered and no one from csm ever seemed
to bring it up either which is why i am honestly less
than impressed with the csm
thanks for the reply i think suicide ganking is a part of
the game and one of the things that makes eve the
game it is the feeling that you can be attacked at
anytime even in highsec adds to the atmosphere i do
not feel like suicide ganking is an issue right now
and im happy with the balance at the moment weve
seen significant ehp buffs to both freighters with the
damage control tiericide and orcas have been
boosted recently you can very easily get 700k ehp
on an orca and move things with its corp hanger on
top of rebalanced dsts ive almost always done solo
logistics for myself as i tend to play solo and ive
never been ganked even moving 45b isk at the time
you need to manage your risk and use the proper
tool for the jobmaking someone looting a wreck that
died through a criminal action get concorded with a
criminal flag doesnt seem like a good idea to me itll
just end up with new players getting concorded and
will kill suicide ganking completely as only the owner
would be able to loot the wreckif you want to vote for
someone who wants to argue with ccp to nerf suicide
ganking then im the wrong candidate contributer to
eve is easyUFFFD
just voted for you nice interview
personally i think its still too early to really say we
dont really have too many details to go off of to
speculate on how it will impact the market yet id like
to see more information on the drilling platforms
before i guessspeculate
ive been a victim of highsec ganking myself where
one you can see here the more recent one have
happened on my neutral hauler which i cant link 
but with that said i do think thank ganking as you
said too is a valid style of gameplay as a hauler you
have to take your own precautions like only carrying
so much value ie dont stuff your freighter to the
brim of shiney goods and make more than one trip if
necessary and even go as far as having a buddy
with you to web you on gates so get yourself off the
gate and in warp faster jfs also have their own
defense as well with being able to bail if you sense
danger we have the tools and knowledge we need to
protect ourselves the idea of flagging loot that was a
part of a gank is an interesting idea but im not sure
how that will work overall and it doesnt seem ideal i
tried to search for the ideas that you mentioned by
thomas on the site you linked but i didnt see
anything perhaps you can link iti think its hard to
find the right balance of risk vs reward  though in
regards to ganking what i would like ccp to look into is
the bumping mechanic again as its still very possible
to keep a freighter bumped nonstop
thank you very much i really appreciate it
interesting ideas for adding something unique about
npc null lowsec got a nice buff with the introduction
of clone soldiers tags for sec and the mordus
legion commanders npc null needs some unique
flavor
hi vicive got an interesting question for you and im
curious how you respondwe both know each other
from around the forums and while weve certainly
disagreed on various points i have a lot of respect for
you as someone who knows how to present a decent
argument and knows the game quite well and i could
see you getting a spot on my ballotso that said
what would you do if you got onto the csm and came
to them with a concern or a change youd like to see
any concern but i dont think youll be surprised if i
use incursions as my example here and they go we
understand your concern but we think thats actually
fine and healthy and heres the data we have to back
that up for incursions that might be the actual rate of
ship loss compared to other gameplay the actual
rate of income anything like that what would your
response be to being presented with contradictory
evidence to your own gameplay experiences
corollary what would your response be to being
presented with a similar counter by ccp but without
the hard evidence just a vague assertion that theyre
monitoring things and dont have a cause for concern
at this timeregardscade
hi cadeso its great you mention data i love data
data has to be one of my favorite things one thing i
have learned over the course of my professional
career is that it opposing the data itself is often futile
and just results in butting heads but how it is
analyzed or interpreted makes all the difference and
discussing that can lead to rather productive
dialogue data collected insilico is generally very
reliable and repeatable so theres basically no
contesting it  i think ccp is going to the sole source of
reliable data pertaining to new eden the monthly
economic reports are a good presentation of data but
they do not actually include much analysis on the
data basically if they showed me data on something
and i disagreed with their interpretation or analysis i
would ask for the data itself and if possible conduct
and independent analysis of it but as stated the data
itself is not contestable yes we can all draw our own
conclusions and make our own stories based on
charts they release but how statistically valid are
they how are they modeling things i am also very
used to my hypotheses being proven very wrong by
evidence where it is all too easy to fall into a mode of
thinking when there is no actual data to guide the
construction of models things invariably look different
from outside the system looking in as opposed to the
other way aroundnot everything is a question of data
or math many of the bigger problems in the game
are philosophical in nature and excessive data and
math may only serves as distracting anecdotes
however i believe my professional training is an
asset i am quite able to take even deep criticism of
ideas on the corollary they are in charge i would
only exist as a sounding board it is my duty to be a
voice for players its up to ccp to hearlisten
i do not agree with everything you say but you are
the best proven candidate voted no1 best of luck
youve got all my votes anyway because i appreciate
what you do and the fact you do do ita question
though if i may i used to be in es and whizz and ran
the operations in fountain for our booster trade we
had a great roleplay component to the corp with the
illegality of boosters that added something to the
game at least in my opinion forging social
connection throughout new eden what are your
thoughts about ccp introducing similar mechanics eg
smugglingstory rich pathways being removed from
the gamei get why boosters were made legal but in
my opinion firstly it would have been good if ccp had
reached out to es and whizz and the other booster
producing corps to at least ask for alternatives
opinions and ideas and secondly that drug smuggling
is something intrinsic to the genre as an option going
back all the way to old elite and its a kind of a shame
such mechanics arent available it adds another
pathway to the trading career both in terms of risk
potential success and also binding the community
together in many ways theyve removed one of the
most social parts of trading out which seems kind of
counterintuitive for a mmo and reduced a well
respected even if not totally legit alliance into just
another corporate trading entity and before someone
states the obvious i can see the parallels here with
the real world operations and the irony of that
hey cochisean interesting topic pretty hard to strike
a balance here i personally dont like highsec
ganking but i accept it as part of the experience and
as a play style that some people seem to enjoy it
also underlines that the capsuleer life is never
perfectly save even in highsec i generally like the
mechanics of concord but would indeed happily look
into the details and support possible adaptions to
criminal flagging and similar provided the result is
not too prohibitive for gankers an alternate looting
mechanic sounds interesting did thomas write an
article about the topic that i could check out
just to clarify where im coming from on this i actually
flew for red frog very early on in my eve career and
ive made money for most of it through jfing ive also
lost a jf to suicide ganking and come very close a
couple more timesas you say suicide ganking is a
pretty valid playstyle a lot of people have fun doing it
and its hard to say they arent putting in the effort to
get that rewardwhat i would say is wrong however is
the bumping mechanic a bumping machariel
properly piloted is as good if not better than a warp
disruptor since you cant just reapproach the gate
id like to see ccp finally implement the alwayswarp
after3minutes change they talked about doing a
while ago if they did that i really wouldnt have a
problem at all with ganking
hi caprii have a somewhat more meta question for
you that i havent found answered yet so far forgive
me if this has been answered somewhere i honestly
didnt look that hardwhats your general approach
to a disagreement either with ccp with a player
offering you feedback to pass along or just their own
experiences or with a fellow csmyou say you
believe the csm should be a sounding board for ccp
and i agree but whats your approach if you and
another csm are giving contradictory information or
testimonyregardscade
sure i would present it to ccp thats my job as a csm
member rightwould i push for its adoption i dont
think a change in looting mechanics is a good thing
so no i wouldnt push for that parti do see however
that the risk vs reward in ganking is pretty one sided
in response to cochise chiricahuasuicide ganking is
definitely a valid style of play and one that i will
always support in this game it is an important part of
the game that makes it feel dangerous and forces
players to think about their decisions especially
when hauling extremely valuable cargohistorically
ccp has made suicide ganking increasingly difficult
especially with changes to freighter ehp i believe the
mechanics around performing a suicide gank and
acquiring the loot from the gank are currently sound
as a multiboxer i also support this style of play and
youll soon have another crazy multiboxer to deal
with p unless i am elected of course cause rip my
time the only thing i would advocate change for is
the ability to perma tackle a target through bumping
bumping is a legitimate mechanic i feel to prevent
targets from escaping through a gate but as a
mechanic to prevent a warp out for an excessive
period of time i feel is unfair suicide ganks should be
coordinated when the opportunity arises not at the
complete leisure of the gank team i would like ccp to
implement the three minute warp out mechanic they
had previously proposed to force extra effort to keep
a target permanently tackled however i would
balance this against the freighter ehp buffs that
recently occurred reverse them i would like to see
more manmode suicide ganks on the gates but i
dont feel it should take the increased number of
gankersdps that the ehp buffs gave
as far as ganking i agree that it is a legitimate
gameplay style and should remain mechanically its
simple enough to accommodate however it should
be a commitment to continue with style of play this
alone should curb too much hisec ganking
unfortunately the mechanic for repairing sec status
would have to change in order to make this happen i
would recommend a timer that limits how often you
can use tags to repair your sec status barring prolific
hisec gankers all other players should remain
unaffected for the most partconcerning your
recommendation to extend criminal flagging to
looters we need to find the limit in which to do this
am i correct in thinking that you want those who
handle the loot post initial gank and loot pick up
should be flagged as criminal as well im not sure
how effective this will be since it could be easy
enough to exchange loot in station and simply wait
out the timermuch like how i view war dec
mechanics those who are successful in this business
are those who know the nuance of the mechanic it
feels that we are constantly playing catch up when it
comes to visibility and spreading knowledge on
these i do hope that this is addressed more
comprehensively in the npe so that new players
coming in are aware prepared and less likely to be
frustrated when it is applied to themthank you for
your question and thank you for being on the other
side of the spectrum of the gankers and war dec
aggressors like myself we appreciate the balance
that you bring
hellothank you for considering me as your
candidate not only for someone living in highsec
that is a relevant question but also for people living
in nullsec and moving their stuff to jita in a freighter
there should be a counter for every game mechanic
lets through the steps of a gank these should be as
follows ship and cargo scanners are a reward
without a risk this could be addressed by making
the user of said modules suspect flashy yellow
bumping not only a problem with highsec freighters
this could be addressed by repeatedly bumping the
same ship again and again having consequences or
other changes to bumping mechanics ganking  the
process of ganking itself is pretty much already
balanced gankers receive no insurance looting it is
currently possible to move the dropped items from
the jetcan belonging to the freighter pilot to another
can which is then picked up without consequences
this should be addressed but becoming suspect
should be enough to allow intervention by other
players while not everything can be addressed like
rolling scangank characters it would be possible to
balance ganking a bit towards more risk without
making it too bad giving a suspect flag to pilots who
are scanning freighters bumping them or looting
allows for more tools in the hands of antiganking
which would make ganking and antiganking a lot
more interesting
last nights eve prosper is out with positive mention of
the campaign
good luck toxicall my eligible chars votes are in and
on you
appreciate it man
give fw some love1
hi vicyou wrote and in gd
hi jojoi dont think those are as contradictory as they
seem the mechanics are sound they havent really
touched those in quite some time the actual numbers
on the ships involved have changed i do think the t1
industrials were overbuffed to the point where fitting
is no longer a compromise as it should be  you can
get a tank and haul quite a lot i think if people had to
learn to fit ships properly at the subcap level then
they would make better choices with freighters and
lots of the noise about how unfair ganks are would
not exist  they would potentially be more likely to
have learned to use the existing tools and mechanics
to keep themselves safe long before they become a
freighterowner smoother inclines allow for easier
learning
demichael crimson i thank you for your reply and will
try it cheers 
hi well tried the link and it still saying i am not able to
vote still know idea why it wont can any one else
please shed light why many players cant vote even
though they have omega accounts

you say you have an interest in mining and that it
needs improvementhowever what ive read of your
ideas in the past focus on a solo miner not a multi
boxermost of us who mine multibox please bear
that in mind what might seem engaging to a solo pilot
could be tedious for someone running a crewbefore
offering elaborate changes to mining make sure you
are in touch with the multiboxing community
whenever ive been talking about changes to mining
ive always said id like to have the current way
stay as well at least when it comes to the act of
mining you may be able to get an improved rate by
paying attention but not as a total replacementid
like to see more gameplay around finding things to
mine the only difference with multiboxing then is that
you may need to do that activity more often no im
not meaning you find one roid mine it then have to
find another clusters which would support someone
for a while
the removal of smuggling gameplay was a double
edged swordit did make things far easier for the
consumers the manufacturers have the problem that
its now easier to sell so more people may get into it
tbh im still in two minds about the change i know it
sounds like a cop out but thats the truth
thanks for the reply and good luck with the campaign
hello cochise thanks for you question if i understand
correctly you proposal is something like change the
currently criminal tag system specially when people
get ganked well the gankers are part of eve as the
criminals on the real life i think is a game style like
pvp pve mining hauling and hell yeahhhh is so
frustrating be ganked but it make the game great
why because we can get the oportunity to kill them
how preparing fleets when they are about to ganking
by corp or friendsi remember when i get safe by an
antiganking fleet  goshh i hate niarja so gankers
make eve more realin the real life when you kill
someone you become a criminal and if you do
something with the body you became in a suspicius
but not a criminal so bring that to eve
afropty 1 you have my vote good sir2  your
solo osprey fit3 do you think people have a reason
to empire build or do people live and attempt to hold
null space simply for content i feel like the
narrative of eve has been lost for the everyday
player i know there is a higher meta that exists
however it seems like for the everyday line
memberf1 monkey there is no reason or narrative to
hold or fight for space anymore what are your
feelings on the matter
hello thanks for your question1 thank you2 at
least i dont need a cap chain lol3 when someone
starts to playing eve everyone recommends to this
new players do not go to low sec systems or stay
in green systems or just simple stay in high sec
probably that make an idea for all new players about
in which place they can stay safelyon the other
hand we got older players with alter
corporationscharacters building in high seclow sec
and probably they get an extra fee avoiding any war
or for another objectivei use to play in high sec
when i getting into null sec this was a new
experience and now i dont know how to live in high
sec i know the mechanics just is not for me in the
null sec you are involved with a large group of players
and they respect you when for example you are
doing a site or mining and is not the same in high
sec in friendly space of courseif you dont wanna
be a line memberf1 monkey just split your guns and
use f1  f2  f3  f4 f8 come onUFFFD

im a big fan of the dialectic in short i really enjoy
arguing and debating because im quite good at not
becoming emotionally invested in any particular
position basically i believe that there is always a right
answer and if you disagree with someone the best
way for both of you to get there is by comparing notes
on how you ended up at your different positions
usually someone will be more right than the other
but even if someone is completely wrong hearing
them out and finding out why they think that allows
you to incorporate a sensitivity towards that position
into your own its possible to believe the wrong thing
for the right reasonsif it came to a point where myself
and another csm disagreed on something or even a
ccp employee id be quite happy laying out in detail
why i think what i think and letting it stand on its
ownat the end of the day theres no reason to fall out
with someone just because you disagree on a few
issues
love this answer i think you just earned yourself a
spot on my ballot

followed by all the interviews and debates that i
participated in which were quite fun as it also helped

hello id like to ask your opinion concerning recent
changes particularly alpha clones stuff and auras
voice
thanks for stopping by my thread and taking time to
postauras voice well apart from those times i need
it i play eve with sound off listening to my own
music or something i must admit the change in
voice takes some getting used toalpha clones
having the potential to have more people experience
eve and join is not a bad thing and being able to log
in to the game to catch up with friends without having
to subscribe for a month seems also to have postive
sides i tried out an alpha clone trying to think if i
have any use for alpha alts but at the moment they
are not for meany other recent changes you would
like my opinion on my eve experience is getting
laggier with every update  or so it seems i need to
update my computer
just for the record it wasnt intended as a loaded
question i understand that csm doesnt decide on or
implement game changes that theyre basically a
player advocacy board for the ccpthanks for the
reply
still taking interview requests from corpsalliances
interested in speaking to me ive done quite the few
and its been a fun experience so far
there is another fw csm candidate campaigning that
the station lockouts dont matter anymore because of
citadels so im surprised how split people are on this
subject ill concede that players who run plexes in
ships like 5x wcs punishers or unfit atrons with t1
guns are a bad thing and id like that changed or
disincentived but thats why i like the idea of
accelerated progress for rolling back a timer for the
opposite faction or timer rollbacks again im not
opposed to real time intel if ccp can implement it in a
ui friendly way like you mentioned its all about how
much ccp is willing to invest in fw i know gorski car
campaigned hard for years but ultimately it was never
on their roadmap so having compromises that are
easier to implement are also a good thing to have i
think it depends on what the person wants to do i
think if youre a solo pilot or maybe have a small
group of inexperienced friends fw is where those
players look not everyone is willing to leave their
corporation there are several guys in highsec
involved with industry mission or incursion groups
for example that like to try pvp every now and then
and fw is the best fit for them since its logistically
easy in empire space is nearby requires no
standingsdiplomacy to other groups fw relies on far
fewer macro skills and outside influences that
solosmall gang pvp in nullsec requires some people
like to get away from the politics of nullsec and fw
brings that to them fw is seen a bit more as casual
fun requiring less effort now if you want to just get
content in gangs sure karmafleetpandemic
hordebrave is probably better it also provides you
with far better finance opportunities than empire
space i dont know where ccp should direct players
ultimately either of those options is going to be a
better fit depending on the players i think removing
the wcs farmers from fw so youre more likely to get
an actual fight will be good and better ui live intel
like you mention or some kind of system where it
encourages players to go somewhere for content will
also be better for fw contentcontributer to eve is
easyUFFFD
not that im aware of that was taken from an e
mailthanks for the reply
wanted to vote for you but youre not on the list
csm candidate rhiload what is your stance on future
of infantry operations in the world of eve online
should such thing exist in the future and should it
have any impact on the game
well thats definitely surprising you logged into your
account right might see if your computer has option
for disk cleanup but i doubt it would cause that
theres also option to clear all cache files in eves esc
menu  reset settings tab  but again i doubt that
would be the problem as wellthe only other option i
can see is submit a support ticket and politely explain
the issue wish i could be more helpfuldmc

hi i am not sure that i am posting this in the right
forum i recently made an alpha account to check it
out and to check out the new player experienceand i
have to say that the npc corp is in lack of a better
words utter cancer endless political debate and any
question was met with apathy the general view of
low and null sec was extremely negative i might have
been there at the wrong time would it be an idea to
have different npc corps depending on how old your
account is i dunno some sort of way to make sure
that new players would spared as much as possible
the old npc players maybe on the base of how old
the account is maybe based on skillpoints im not
sure myself on ideas or how to word this it just
struck me how negative the older players were if this
was how it was when i started to play i am not sure i
would be playing today
hey there firstly thanks for the question appreciate
you taking the time to askhaving started out as a
high sec miner myself i know all too well the effect of
ganking and how it changes ones perception of eve
online personally i see it as a perfectly fine mechanic
in its current iteration in fact i look back and enjoy
the fact i got ganked several times as it drove me to
improve my stylein regards to the idea you posted i
think it is an interesting possibility i like the idea of
those goods being hot and anyone interacting with
them becomes a known criminal or at least a known
accomplice there are several stories in eve where
someone has been screwed over and spent a long
time working their way into this group and getting
their revengein the current mechanics a group of
alts ganking someone is pretty much the end of that
story someone loses their stuff and hopefully learns
a lesson theres very little opportunity for long term
revenge finding the actual culprit and plotting to
screw them over i would be interested to see what
ccp would think about this as a possible mechanic
i find this idea intriguing but generally i think highsec
ganking mechanics are easily mitigated if you take
steps yourself scouting using webbing toons
splitting up loads
hello eve online pilotsi feel the best thing to do is
modify the skill to it gives 2 instead of 1 on both
both target management and advanced target
management so we can get the ships maximum
locked targets otherwise it looks dumb that we
cannot reach the ships true potential making ships
having the capability and not be able to reach the
ships full potential is bad form and should be fixed i
am not saying this for my benefit as i am saying this
to make the game a better place for all of us in new
edeni also feel that the signal amplifier ii should give
me 2 maximum locked targets bonus as well ship
locking bonus irregardless of skill level to make it so
one can lock 2 per module like it says in the
attributesyes i also plan will bring this up with my
csm candidates i picked as well as i have talked to
others as well as this is something that needs fixed to
make the game better for all of us as i am not the
only person in the game that feels the way on
thishinthint best regardszzwolf47ccp

i just really want to reinforce this xd
youll have 10 votes from me old friend ill try to
convince my hs buddies to vote for you as well
so wait in that case taking down a keepstar is the
same as taking down a pos tower in terms of needed

ok
i tried looking on the csm page but couldnt see the
info that i was looking for historically players have
only been able to vote if they had a paid up account
that was older than 90 days iirc with alpha clones i
assume that means a character older than 90 days
but i couldnt see if a clone needs to be omega or not
it is possible that alphas cannot vote as anyone could
make infinite voters if they had the patience and rig
the voteperhaps have a look or search for the
requirements for voting or post in new users q  a
dont forget to vote
plain and simple the removal of ccp fozzie he is a

hi cochisefirst of all sorry for my late reply i hope you
are still interested in my answeri strongly believe that
ganking itself should remain how its currently set up
however i do feel that new players should have more
information about the dangers that gankers pose and
how to do something about iti have always been pro

have one tip from the makers on how you could
handle a specific task or skill in the gamethis i
believe is what eve really lacks because eve does
not really have loading screens instead you have
cinematics on you docking in a station or jumping the
gate still i feel when this would be incorporated this
would increase player awareness and also adds
quality to the game so instead of changing the game
mechanics youd be giving players that would usually
get ganked a chance to really up their game and fight
backoh and dont haul billions in a t1 industrial
outsource it to red frog or another hauler community
i dont have a problem with implants links and drugs
i cant engage them with my clean playstyle of not
using them so i just avoid them when those same
pilots ask me to 1v1 when they have a deadspace
fitted ship with drugs and i dont and they bring in
their link rr legion dishonoring the 1v1 then yeah i do
like to make fun of them in local but that is part of
eve quoteah you refer to our last dance together
if you recall i said in local want to go i never said
lets 1v1 please keep the facts straight
thanks for the responsei think we see things pretty
much the same with a few minor exceptionsyou
wouldnt want to join faction war if you still want to
mission or do other pvehauler type things in high
sec you have a huge wardec with about 50000
characters it would be better to be in a null sec corp
if you wanted your characters to still do high sec stuff
i dont believe gorski ever pushed for rollbacks real
time intel or really anything that would significantly
improve fw sov his big thing was fw missions
missions dont effect sov i think ccp addressed his
concerns but fw sov is still brokeni think people are
mixed about station lockouts lots of people left fw
due to them ccp put the lockouts in during inferno
the idea had come up before then and players
routinely rejected it because it would decrease pvp
thoughout the map and if you look at a faction war
map you will see there is definitely lots of deadspace
so i would think lots of faction war players are happy
they can now set up in citadels of course there are
those who think the lockouts were good and they
have good reasons to support their view as well i
think that issue is less clear cut than the question of
whether you should most effectively gain sov for your
faction by running away make faction war occupancy
pvp instead of pve
1 good platform and knows his stuff
hmm i find it a bit too drastic it would effectively
make empire space i am assuming from 10 to 01
here consensual pvp it would be eves trammel in
a waythe idea has some merit in that it has worked
in some other games but still i prefer deterrence and
selfpolicing than outright preventionof course this
solution here would be the easiest to implement for
ccpi do agree that the slap in the face mechanics
and the weak security system in place is a deterrent
to players playing the game at this time and this
situation needs to be turned around for sureif
anyone really cares about eve that is
how much stuff moves around hs vs is ganked or
killed in a wardc how many players move around hs
vs being ganked or killed in a wardec
not sure i understand your question what do you
mean
most players move around hs unmolested most
haulers move around hs unmolested in fact id say
tens of trillions move around for every trillion that died
in a gank or a war dec over the course of a month
that is hs pvp is not some overwhelming ubiquitous
thing that is stifling game playbut we see or hear
about those who get killed because we keep track of
them via killboards like zkill so you are reacting to
what you see but ignoring what you cant see or see
so easily go sit in uedama and watch how many
freighters go through without a problem do it for an
hour my guess is youll be surprised
i see thanks for explaining so it is a statistical point of
view you are expressingyet there is a psychological
effect here to consider this is no different than
someone getting attacked by a shark in a crowded
beach many people will be deterred from going to
that beach thereafter anyways regardless of the
statisticsi mean if i come and tell yo there is a great
white that killed someone here yesterday would you
go swimming even if you know that it is the only
attack in the past 6 monthsrationally and
emotionally would youand that is just one aspect of
all thisthe second question to ask is why is it wrong
that several haulers make it past in uedana i mean
do you start killing truckers in the street because too
many trucks get to pass by every day you would be
considered a murderer and a criminal if you did
thatthis kind of behaviour is what is loathed
everyone can understand on the other hand
warfareyou want to prevent a competitor corp from
making their deliveries and hamper them in the
market that is why wars are there make war and
fight it out ambush their haulers etc etcbut the
average new developing player is not after
conquering the market cornering the market or
competing with industrial coprs profits the average
player that comes to play eve is a scifi enthusiast
seeking an experience in space to explore it to trade
in it to mine in it not necessarily for grand profit but
for the enjoyment of doing these activities yes there
are people who enjoy mining as weird as that may
sound to some and not everyone comes to play eve
with the intent to do combat and murder other
peoples character and pop other peoples ships not
everyone is aggressive like that or enjoys to be
aggressive towards other players and these people
are shunned out of the gameand it is human nature
to want safety too this is why we invented laws and
peace enforcement if we were all fine in living every
day looking behind our shoulders in an anarchy we
would not have laws ethics human rights and
morals we would all live like animals eat or be
eatenand it matters not if this is a game the feeling
of constant fear is not enjoyable to many people who
instead would just move on to play something
elsethis is why it would be good i think that fear is
considerably reduced from empire space let people
have fun in it let people come out from it on their own
accord according to their own realisations and thrill
and most importantly emergent ambitionsthere is
nothing wrong with the game having a large empire
population which is enjoying itself according to what
is enjoyable to itdont you think
the shark analogy is interesting in that it depends on
the behavior of the shark if it sticks around and is
territorial no that would be foolish and
imprudentand most people who are ganked are
imprudent and foolishsimilarly if you undock your
freighter and there is a war dec you are being very
imprudent and foolishusing your analogy not only
was there a shark attackyou can still see the shark
swimming around and yet go in the water
anywaysyou must keep in mind that risk is not
something that the game comes along and imposes
on you out of the blue chances are if you find
yourself in a very risky situation it is because you did
something to bring that risk down on you if you look
at freighter suicide ganks ie excluding war decs for
example most of them have way too much cargo
value even the ones that have low cargo value you
should check to see if they have a double wrapped
courier package those often get ganked based on
the premise if they double wrapped it it must be
valuable in other words these players took actions
that increased their riskeditthe takeaway is this be
prudent and your risk of a suicide gank is actually
quite small in a war dec again the idea is prudence
do not undock in your marauder or whatever
expensive ship you have in times of war dec it is
even more important to follow eves number one rule
do not fly anything you cannot afford to loseso if you
are prudent and learn the game mechanics youll be
quite safe in hs you wont be 100 safe but all you
have to do is be faster than the other guy when the
bear is chasing you the new player will have to learn
this and the best way is by doing itlearning by
doing trial and errorand flying ships you can afford
to replace
actually yes the game does impose risk because the
game decides what is possible and what is not not
the playerstell me what is wrong with a guy on a
covetor mining in an ice field in high sec and
suddenly having a catalyst blowing it up without any
kind of provocation yes a minute later the catalyst
was dead by concordtoo late though for the
covetorwho faulted herei cannot blame the miner
for mining did he really do a mistake for what
wanting to log on to a game and having some funwe
could try to blame the killer but that would not solve
anything the issue is the games systems which
made it possible for the attacker to attackit causes
everything else mentioned aboveto continue upon
the shark analogy eve empire space is like a resort
in a tropical island inviting people to have fun surfing
while not having a fence in place to protect them from
shark attacksas for the example of the double
wrapped courier package who decided that people
should not transport these it seems all very arbitrary
to me and not in a good wayand again the games
system permit you to decide that so and so should
not be transporting what they want to and that they
should be attacked for the apparent value in their
holdthis is a problemfrom one side the game
provides tools for transport and mechanics for
packages and form the other lets thugs punish
people for wanting to have fundont you see that in
the long run this is detrimental to the game itself
because the hauler has two choices really one is to
turn in to a thug themselves and give up hauling or
simply go play something else and be totally
indifferent to you like if you never existed and matter
notpeople say your not obligated to play the game
and i agree it is true i am not if i think that the game
is unfun i can quit it no opne can force me to stay
the game goes in the garbage and gets a bad
reputation and you become nothing and the
aggressor here becomes nothing just a whisper in
the wind for whom ia m totally indifferent about is
that what you want people to throw eve in the
garbage and consider its player community
insignificant and meaninglessit is only a matter of
time before you find yourself alone in a shrinking
game communitythere are many mechanics in the
game already for aggression faction wars corp
wars nulsec wars wormhole wars if action is what
you seek take your pick it is all there no need to go
after the new players the weak players or the
unnamed onesi dont understand what would be lost
by having a safer more just empire space where
crime is deterred and discouragedi can only see
what the game and its community would win with
such a setup
no teckos you are wrong it is closer to 500t or 1 000t
isk that move around highsec for every 1t that is lost
in highsec not 10t isk this is according to ccp
quants numbers for example last month 1 917 t isk
worth of goods moved in or out of the forge while only
269 t isk 014 was destroyed in domain it was 1
299 t isk transported and only 144 t isk 011 lost
and those destruction numbers are losses due to all
things including npcs not just wars and criminals
highsec is incredibly safe as a whole by any
objective or subjective criteria the chances of you
losing something are minuscule in almost every
situation i get that for whatever reason some
carebears have convinced themselves that highsec is
a warzone where there is a ganker or wardeccer
behind every asteroid but it really isnt the case
those crime numbers would be the envy of any
jurisdiction and show how much the mechanics
favour the highsec denizen over the aggressornow i
also get that those losses probably disproportionately
fall on the newer players once players figure out the
mechanics the only way to lose something in
highsec is to be incredibly unlucky or become
complacent or greedyimprudent most of those
economic numbers reflect veteran players operating
in near complete safely and with impunity to
attackers while the losses fall to those with less
understanding of the game mechanics or the just
badlazygreedy that is however how a competitive
game is suppose to work i am not sure how ccp can
ever reconcile the fact that some players find losing
stuff nonconsensually a slap in the face or worse
even just the chance they could lose their stuff with
the fact eve online is a fulltime pvp sandbox game
where you consent to pvp when you undock that will
indeed turn off some players even after they have
nerfed piracy to near zero in highsec and made
wardecs completely consensual for the individual
player there are still players who wont accept any
risk that they will lose their stuff no matter how lazily
they play the game or that it is not possible to be
100 safe no matter how much effort they make to
be left alone these players are just simply playing the
wrong game they wont be happy no matter what ccp
does short of trammelizing the game i dont think ccp
can or will nerf highsec risk much more we are pretty
much at peak safety heh maybe i am wrong on that
as i thought that last week and then ccp came up with
the instaplex travel hanger i wonder if the pcu will
track lower after this anticontent safety buff like it
seems to have with all the others i mean i think this
hanger probably is a good idea for new players and
maybe thus overall but it will come at yet another
cost to player activity in the game by removing a
profession plex hauler and some playerdriven
stories over large losses in plex that drove interest
and engagement with the game i guess time will tell
it would be nice if ccp actually added something to
the game to create content and activity instead of just
deleting conflict drivers and making things safer and
safer as seems to have preferred development
activity over the last 57 years such content drivers
might actually turn around the falling player numbers

i stand corrected i thought it might be more than that
but was too lazy to lookand completely agreed with
that final paragraph
no that is creating the environment we play in yes
ccp made it possible to suicide gank other players in
hs they also made it harder to kill players than in ls
and especially ns but that is not risk risk is based
almost entirely on the players actionsfor example if i
put 700 million isk work of cargo into my tanked
freighter and use a scout and manually pilot ill likely
be fine on the other hand if i were to put 7 billion into
an antitanked freighter and not use a scout my
actions have caused me to face considerably more
risk note in both instances the game environment is
the same but it is my actions that dictate the level of
risk i am taking onrisk is a function of player actions
behave imprudently and youll have more risk
behave prudently youll have lower riskedit and
using your mining barge example the miner made
choices that affected his risk he went for a covetor
when he could have gone for a procuror with a solid
tank the former is easy to gank solo the latter
cannot be ganked solochoicesthis game is all
about choices
and see black pedros post above huge amounts of
isk value moves around the game absolutely huge
to put this in perspective lets convert those isk
amounts into us dollar amounts via plex prices in
game and out of gameso 1917 trillion isk converts to
32940698 lets just call it 33 millionhow much
was destroyed well 296 trillion isk or only a paltry
50863 and lets call if 51 thousandfor this kind of
thing to happen i am going to make a wild and bat
 crazy claimhs must be very very very safe for
people to move that kind of isk value around with so
little destroyed the actual risk is tinythe
calculationsdivide 1917000000000000 by
1161000000 the latter being the current cost of a
plex in jitathat yields a number of 1651163 which
when you multiply it by the oog cost of a plex 1995
we get 32940698editto further support my
contention that hs is quite safe go look at ccp quants
numbers and in particular look at the ns regions and
the amount of isk value moving around it is very
small by comparison why maybe because it is
dangerous to move around in ns putting 500 million
isk into a tanked obelisk and using a scout youll be
be able to move around hs without minimal fear of a
gank go try that in ns and let me know how it works
out for you do it everyday for a month

hello friendi would like to take the time to talk with
you about our lord and savior toxic yaken while the
unwashed heathens of new eden are busy worshiping
false gods and elevating false prophets the one true
god in all his splendor takes the time to read
everyday complaints and grievances such as yours
oh sinner i urge you to repent of your evil ways and
learn to love our lord as he has always loved you a

sock puppet agenda schill alt safe to ignore
im pretty sure this is bait but i like bait so i will take it
anyways ccp recognizes ganking as one of the two
main pillars of highsec pvp and i will personally not
support any proposals to remove it changing
crimewatch to have compounding bans for criminally
flagged pilots will pretty much kill ganking or force
players into ganking on alphas and would likely have
a way more negative impact on fw and lowsec
banning anyone who goes criminal there making this
mechanic work only in highsec would require an even
bigger pass at crimewatch mechanics to either create
a new flag or differentiate between regional criminal
tags all to create something that ccp doesnt agree
with in the first placeif you have thoughts to make
ganking more interactive through id be happy to hear
them i know there are a lot of players who feel
strongly about ganking and im not trying to
discourage those players from reaching out about it
but i will try to be critical of proposals to changes with
highsec pvp mechanics because of the ways in
which players will inevitably use and abuse

hello csm candidateshighsec security and justice
system is an important item for me and i suspect
many othersi would like to inquire if there are any
candidates here who have in their platform a plan to
introduce or suggest a new and better security 
justice system for highsec to deal with criminals and
criminal behaviours towards weak and innocent
capsuleersas a highsec citizen of empire space i am
interested in seeing empire space a better place to
live in and currently find that the security and justice
system in place if very weak innocents and unnamed
citizens in all four empires get attacked with impunity
miners are in danger so are traders and also citizens
working for the various agents not to mention new
citizens recently having undergone the
transformation to capsuleerspirates dominate the
lower sec of empire space it is maybe time that
empires do something about it ordinary citizens are
not able to conduct business in all of empire
spaceplease feel fee to reply here with links to your
intro posts so i can look up your plans and better
decide on votingplease only candidates who actually
have a plan to improve security and justice in
highsecthank you kindly

is too much work for you
hello miss loreleithank you i read your platform it is
interestingi do not come often to the forums i
thought it would be better to just ask instead of trying
to read through all the platforms besides it also
shows like this who is actually paying attention to
ordinary citizens like myself in the community on top
of who is interested in enhancing the game play of
empire space for those that live in itthank you
an interesting idea there should be no free lunch in
the game
from my understanding beyond having to flee from
npc police when in low standings there are no real
advantages to having a high standing to a faction
back in the day if i remember correctly you needed
a high standing to an empire to place a pos in high
sec alas no longer i have unfortunately no answers
readyathand but i believe that having worked a high
standing should give something back maybe a
reduction in fuel costs for structures
oh yeah we really need eve to be esport with que for
1v1what not clear for me why somebody who lives
in 00 alliance is relevant for lowsec just couse once
he played there
i think it is pretty clear what we should expect if vote
on you since you talk only about yourself nothing
straight info what you want to achieve in csm and
you not answer at all to the questions some people
will vote for you for sure many lemmings play this

i think there is another very important mechanic
which makes wardecs so lame  its the socalled
undockfapping gameplay its pretty common for
wardeccers to just sit at trade hub stations and wait
for easy prey its more like fishing than pvpthe
undock mechanics of citadels should extend to
stations for everybody who has security status above
criminal level this would achieve 2 things 1 less
deaths on undock due to lags 2 no stationcamping
by wardeccers gatecamping is not the best
gameplay either but it is significantly less safe for the
participants than stationcampingto make riskreward
scheme work in wardecs we also need a proper risk
source we should rather have mercenary mechanics
which was a great idea just not working useful this
can be achieved by these steps1 eliminating
undockcamping to move wardeccers further from
safety2 introducing highsec covertcynos see this

fluffing something out could you be a big more
concise
to be quite honest and youre probably not going to
be a fan of this im actually happy where the ganking
is in highsec right now ive performed it myself both
on kalen directly and on a few alts there is no way to
alter the loot passing suspect without changing
something for all sections of space unfortunately as
long as the hauler is in the fleet that kills a freighter
theres no risk for them also the profitability really
comes down to the freighter themselves if theyre a
properly tanked obelisk with a moderate amount of
items in the hold then it will be significantly less
profitable to gank them versus the cargo expanded
charon carrying like 2 incursion pirate battleships
thats where it comes down to risk versus reward on
your behalf the more you carry at once the more risk
youre taking
i dont like to play word games and words lawyer with
people if i say something or someone else says
something i take what they mean at face value i dont
twist my words and you do yourself discredit by doing

honest traders you just didnt read the rules
regardless of that my point still stands in response to
your post i have nothing against people who play
only to win and break agreements in eve i dont have
a problem with command bursts alts implants drugs
or any of that but i reserve the right to make fun of
them for their risk aversion privately on my own

hold his hand and pat his poopooand if a new player
is leaving because he cant earn a plexthat is an
incredibly stupid argument what do you think it would
take so any old new player could earn a plex in a few
days or 23 weeks after joining the gamehere any
new player who is thinking about buying plex in game
wildly unrealistic expectations oh ill earn a plex
every month so i can play for free by grinding hours
of my free timeto play for free hed quit anyways
out of the sheer horror of spending all his free time
grindingin fact ill offer this alternative conjecture
about plex the people who largely buy plex and play
for free are more than likely people who have been
playing awhile and have developed ingame income
streamswealth that let them do this some plex are
bought as a store of value although with deflation
going on right now this need is reduced imo those
selling plex are by and large the new players who
want isk without the grind that is plex are most likely
filling a redistributive role ingame shifting isk from
those who have it to those who do not this is a good
thing isk sitting in player xs wallet is doing nothing
plex going into new guys wallet will likely be quickly
spent and put back into some degree of circulation
further it weakens the market for illegal isk
purchasesall this focus on how can a new player
get a plex is just simply moronic new players do get
plexfor sale so they can get isk
the ability to mouse over a value and get the real
double or float value and be able to copy it the
rounded off value makes it impossible to create
accurate spreadsheets also provide information on
one of your websites on how to properly calculate
broker fees and any other value that requires a
complex equation using actual values not rounded
off ones this always has been an issue to methe
ability to drag n drop links from the people and
places menu into chat or mail currently you have to
open the info panel then drag n drop the image or
text of the placeauto pilot would be better if it
stopped by the gate around 1km instead of
15kmchange plex so that it cannot be dropped if ship
is destroyed so it can be stolen by enemy players
this is the same as stealing real moneyadd the ability
to compress ore in any station not just player owned
citadels or player owned stationseither get rid of or
change what the margin trading skill does reducing
escrow is not a perk rather its a problem when you
run out of money causing your buy orders to be not
fulfilledmake concord more dangerous to players
who engage unlawfully in hisec as of now players
tend to not care about concord and engage
unlawfully without penaltyfor a game based on 20
thousand years in the future why are we still using
metal can steampunk style ships and balloon
propulsion why not give us biologically grown ships
that can fold spacewhen warping instead of having
a heat wave tube for the effect why not make it so
the whole environment threads out like in startrek or
other science fictionwhy is space full of clouds why
not make the background with different types of stars
and galaxies and other things based on astronomy
that would be nice yes in many cases the actual
number is provided through the api not for broker
fees thoughcould have sworn you could ill bring it up
if theres an appropriate time not going to change
manual piloting will always be safer and more
efficient than autopiloting this is a design decisiongo
have a read of the most recent devblog on plex you
want to see the plex vaultprobably not going to
change there have to be benefits to people having
infrastructure at riskmargin trading is a very very
useful skill when you get to scale i have buy orders i
could not cover if they all came in at once but in
regular activity theyre all covered by the
corresponding sell orders concord will destroy the
ship of people who engage unlawfully in highsec if
youve seen people avoiding this you should enter a
support request as this is a banable offence uh
what uh what you have heard of nebula right
ahh all such good ideas sadly nothing new
regrettably eve doesnt obey the laws of common
sense you get used to it or stop playing most
people take the later option hence the small player
basewith the exception of the proposed plex vault
change and that is being fought tooth n nail as i
type all the things you mentioned where deliberately
designed to be that way the plex losses where
originally by design too but someone has grown up
and finally seen sense its all part of a dedicated
ideal that ccp would rather have a smaller player
base of bullies than a larger player base of happy
gamers
please be respectful and post constructively
oh the salt lolbut seriously its hi sec and its the most
unsafe space in eve why because people dont get
that concord isnt a preventive measure like safe
zones in wow you arent playing wow your playing
eve so next time instead of wishing somebody else
will save you like the csm or ccp why not get off your
butt use a scout and play like you have some brain
matter in between your ears thank you ccp csm and
3rd party sites like zkillboard for providing methods
for us understanding this maxim never
underestimate the power of stupidity in large groups
george carlin
well as i stated before the mechanics are on their
own good however the way ccp reaches newbros
on prepping them might not be hences the fact i
believe they should implement these info lines when
you are dockingundocking or when you jump the
gates this could be very suttle such as the amarrian
empire wishes you a nice flight beware of gankers
or the gallentean authorities wish you a nice flight
beware that shooting other players in high security
space could lead to falling of security statusalso i
am pro bringing back isk gambling sites i think rmt
real money trading should not be a reason to ban
them however implement rules such as ccp
supervision
yes and no the keepstar has a really big feature that
i think is one of the problems and thats its arcing
doomdsay weapon done properly a keepstar can
essentially wipe several caps off the field with this
and in combination with using the bombs missiles
and applicable ewar its a huge force multiplieri
agree groups like hk are so entrenched that theres
no easy way of doing any kind of eviction but what
im arguing is that a poss defenses capabilties even
something like a large dickstardeathstar is at most
as capable as a fortizar though personally i believe
in terms of offensive capabilities a fortizar is
significantly better though it loses in the ewar role to
a proper dickstar whereas a keepstar can add the
equivalent of many many ships in supportalso
players of eve if you havent done so yet find a
candidate that speaks to you and get out and vote for
them if you dont participate in this game youre
essentially giving away your right to whine about any
future changes that ccp wants to bring to eve
because youre demonstrating with your actions that
you dont care
sigh evidently my response didnt submit last timei
think the whole standings model could be a little
clearer for instance i dont think its obvious that
when you run missions you are going to lose
standings with a certain faction so much so that
eventually you cant go into their space any morei
havent gone through the process of trying to repair
faction standing but i hear its a bit of a pain to do
so
i love this narrative it is like a ghost story told around
the camp fire or an urban legend that is passed from
one generation of teenagers in town to the next
based on no evidence or on no facts it sounds
plausible and resonates emotionally with eve players
yet completely misses the big picture ok here is my
version of the tale likely much more reflective of the
average gamer who attempts evethey think about all
the exciting options in this dystopian wartorn
universe ccp has built and they decide they first need
to to gather some resources and perhaps train some
skills before they head out on their exciting
adventure so they go mining in highsec they mine
for some days in a silent belt in highsec and
nothing happens they keep going perhaps
upgrading their mining ship after a few weeks and
still nothing happens now they are getting a little
antsy the playerdriven battles over space or industry
they heard about are not apparent to them so they
start to question why they are spending so many
hours staring at a mining laser for no real reason
perhaps at this point they just stop logging in or
maybe they switch to missioning as at least here
there are some explosions now a few months later
they are sitting in their raven still having no
interactions with the greater sandbox then other
perhaps sellingbuying a few things on the market
and finally it dawns on them eve is a terribly boring
game they gave it a try but nothing happened no
opponent materialized and no greater goal appeared
to them they spent months playing but saw no
massive fleet fights nor any of the machinations of
the industrialist of new eden for control of the
markets just a few other silent miners in the belts
and spent a lot of time interacting with repetitive npc
agents why bother wasting any more time or money
on this snoozefestthey leave they directly leave
they dont pass go they dont come to the forums and
whine about how they were ganked or how unfair the
game is they simply leave for another game more
interesting than eves current highsec solo
experience the only evidence of their presence and
their weeks and months of boredom is buried deep in
the game logs found only when someone like ccp
rise or ccp quant goes lookingi am sure a handful of
people have left the game after being ganked and not
bothered to fill out the questionnaire but i am
convinced that the sterile and lifeless place much of
highsec has become has bored manyfold more
potential eve players out of the game many of whom
also leave quietly or perhaps even tell ccp their
game is boring probably most of them wouldnt
even articulate it as such and just attribute their
inability to get into the game as something wrong or
incompatible with them even though they just never
found the more exciting or fun bits that they might
have really enjoyed really though the problem is
showing these new players the real potential of the
game through the backdrop of an overly safe and
unrepresentativeoftherestofthegame place like
highseceve online is a complex and unique game
that will always have trouble getting players engaged
with the full game however making highsec
completely safe would not do anything to help the
game longterm as ccp rise saidwe have tried and
tried to validate the myth that griefing has a
pronounced affect on new players  we have failed
isolating players away from the actual sandbox
seems very contrary to what we would like to
accomplishyes you can lose stuff in new eden but
it is so so so much easier to make stuff in modern
eve online that in almost any situation losses are
inconsequential even for new players if you cannot
handle losing a fraction of a percent of your net worth
under any circumstance however eve online might
not be the game for you
and one last campaign article before voting
closeshow to get capsuleers in eve to vote
crossingzebras
this is actually very correct many players undergo the
sameespecially the last part about not giving
feedback most players will not they will indeed throw
the game in the garbage bin and move on the
problem being the gamehaving said this there is also
those who come in to the game fully aware of its
realities but simply wanting to enjoy the other aspects
of it sans too much pvp aggression or conflict i mean
the occasional suicide gank etc is acceptable it is
part of the reality of the game but one can still enjoy
it through some missions still enjoy various careers
between security distribution mining and research
small scale industry can be fun as wellthe issue here
is of a different nature people who are not interested
too much in pvp aggression and conflict are limited in
how far they can have fun in the gameand in the
long terms the game does become boring under that
limitation someone said i do not remember in which
thread that ccp made some statistic and found out
that people who were ganked were more likely to stay
in game that those that haventi say this maybe so i
would not dispute the factual statistic but i am
disputing the interpretation of them the people who
stay after being ganked did so because the gank
gave them anew area to explore of the game many of
then most probably wanted to learn how to fight
themselves and it was a change of pace and added
more time to their enjoyment but the people who
were not ganked and quit did not leave because they
did not get ganked they left because the game is
boring in high sec in the long run if you do not wish to
pvpand i think the actual numbers were not given i
seriously think that there were far more people who
left than those who stayed the game may sport pvp
but it is still an mmorpg and it has to be expected
that it will attract people who do not wish to have fun
with pvp and are looking to have fun in other areas
high sec is the place they can have that fun but it is
limited and this limits their time in game
tooexpanding highsec to include more systems all
the way to in my opinion 02 with similar security
punishment as 05 would in my opinion make it
viable for many such players to stay in eve much
much longer and heck even move to other areas of
the game in their own pace and time too it would
definitely make eve high sec allot less boring since it
will open the way to more mission opportunities
mining and industry for these players with a relative
protectionwe all know eve is not 100 safe
anywhereunfortunately the vocal mob of the forums
is of the mindset that everyone should pvp and any
other opinion gets bombarded and burred alive with
rhetoric of what they think and want the game should
be like all the while new players keep on quiting
the most glaring problem with your idea is it is an
obviously zerosum change that would delete much
of the space that thousands of players use every day
why should ccp take away 75 of lowsec and give it
to you dont you think that might have a negative
impact on the players that do log in to fight and pve in
lowsec today i mean its not like highsec is
overcrowded i make a point of visiting the more
obscure corners of highsec and the vast majority of
systems once you get away from the trade hubs
have only a couple pilots in them at any time or are
empty further have you ever entered lowsec aside
from the faction warfare stuff the general missions
and mining gameplay is near identical to the rest of
empire space sure you have level 5 and some
higher end ore but it basically is the same as highsec
if you want to run missions or mine you already can
perfectly well in highsec i dont think slightly
increasing the number of systems where players can
mine or mission with concord protection is going
make anyone stay playing eve much longer the
gameplay would be near identical and they can
already do it in the 1200 or so systems in highsec
removing most of lowsec as an accessible pvp space
and home of faction warfare would cause people to
leave however it would seem to me if you really want
that content it would be better to ask ccp to add that
content back to highsec than delete most of lowsec to
give it to you i do find it amusing that you accuse
others of bombarding you with rhetoric about how
the game should work when it is you asking for
radical changes to the game as it doesnt conform to
your narrow view of how a pvp game should work
many of us actually like eve the way it is as does ccp
apparently i am not sure where you get your hubris
to tell everyone else how they should play or design
an openworld pvp sandbox game by all means
share what you are looking for in a game but you
also need to realize how and why eve was designed
this way and that ccp has stuck with this vision for
almost 15 years and that it is an mmo that other
people like to play in its current form
im sorry to say but you just post the same flawed
ideas over and over without actually considering the
counter arguments to your rather flawed proposals it
was mentioned multiple times in multiple threads that
expanding highsec will literally do nothing since it
already offers enough space and systems which are
completely empty if you are looking for a corner
where you dont have to compete with too many
peopleif you are thinking that the problem is the pve
content then why are you not asking for more pve
content in the last years ccp actually started to
expand on that and it would not surprise me if they
add more interesting content in the future for people
who like to shoot npc etc this can be added to the
highsec as it is i dont see why this should be a
problemthe problem most people have with your
approach is that you literally try to delete whole parts
of the game and the whole core concept that you are
not 100 save everywhere this has nothing to do
with the availability of pve content those things are
completely unrelated
if a new player is busy trying to earn a plex im sorry
he is doing it wrong if you were to buy a sub for an
entire year it costs 1095 vs 1995 for a plex
grinding for a plex is going to be very costly in terms
of leisure time forgone especially for a new player
such a player is literally setting himself up for
failurefirst off this is a competitive game no matter
what you are in competition with other players you
will always be in competition with other players even
if you are never gankedthat is suppose you want to
mine and further suppose you are never ever
ganked you are still in competition with other players
who are mining and buying minerals and those who
are engaged in arbitrage of minerals between
regions the point is if you define pvp as competition
it is everywhere in eve you cannot avoid it evernow
if you want to avoid shiptoship pvp fine go for it but
given the nature of eve if another is determined that
you experience such pvp you are going to experience
itso get used to itand yes the analysis suggests that
those who interact with other players vs being
isolated in their own solar system never interacting
stay substantially longer with the gamethat is
possible but you are omitting that those killed legally
stay almost as lone on average as those ganked
the implication is pretty clear playeronplayer
interaction is good for retention that is treating the
game as a console game and having no interaction is
bad for retentionof course those who left probably
outnumbered those who stayed those who were
ganked and killed legally were about 15 of the
sample thus 85 were not suicide ganked or killed
legally so it is reasonable to conclude those who left
was largerbut those who left were predominantly
those who were not suicide ganked or killed legally
in other words you dont know how to interpret the
data yourselfi have cut off the rest as it the usual
mealymouthed nonsense about some players do
not like pvp fine then gtfo this is a competitive
mmorpg no matter what you are going to do you are
going to come into conflictcompetition with other
players be it via the market trying to suck up all the
ice before the other guy or shooting him in the face
that is the core nature of the game either you grasp
that or you get out of ftown
oh and regarding a new player grinding for a
plexhey you dopesopportunity costyou get it
when it comes to mining your own minerals but you
completely fail to get it everywhere elsehint
opportunity cost applies to literally everythingholy
 cant believe i had to explain this
hello loreleiif i may i would like to ask a few questions
to know your thoughts on some topics1st  what do
you think of highsec content is it fun is it
accessible is it enough2nd would you like to have
more content accessible in high sec and if yes what
would be your suggestions to do it3rd  would you
be for an expansion of high sec to include low sec
meaning expanding the concord rule set to include all
the way to 02 with only 01 systems being bereft of
concord presence how do you think this would
sound current to high sec citizens4th you speak of
do you think this to be a result of lack of trust maybe
even some level of fear are empire citizens apathetic
to one another because they fear and do not trust
one another no knowing who will turn around to back
stab them or player kill them in an ambush or declare
war on them is this maybe what prevents empire
citizens form developing a we5th what do you
think of factional warfare6th while many in eve
seem to confuse the difference between player killing
and pvp i would like to know if you see a difference
and what would be your thoughts separately towards
pvp in general and player killingto be clear here pvp
means a contest between two people capable of
fighting while player killing is the more cowardly
violent action of a player towards other who is weaker
and unable to fight this also includes ganking in low
sec between a hunter and a victim7th do you think
that justice and punishment systems are adequate
currently in empire space and if not any ideas on
how to improve them8th why do you play eveall
the best in your campaign

hi thanks for taking the time to writei saw your
independent thread on the forums
nope why would anyone be for that there are lots of
high sec systems with hardly any life why make
more of them that will not address any problems i
have mined  existed in high sec i have mined 
existed in lowsec and i have mined  existed in
nullsec despite my killboard i felt safest in null sec
nullsec for mining safety and i would urge my
carebear cousins to try it concord do and mean
nothing literally nothing gankers have optimised
themselves so much that expanding concord
response space will make imho large swathes of
eve much less attractive for anyone who uses
themwhat do the different sec statuses really mean
anyway different ores available one can do quite
well just mining veldspar just ask chribba the
overwhelming majority of high sec citizens wouldnt
hear it if you said it that is the sad truth and what
would they do with it like i said there are already
enough high sec systems or do you think everyone
should have their ownnow a question from me have
you tried for example ganking do you know what
you are talking aboutquotesivar ahishatsu 4th
you speak of do you think this to be a result of lack of
trust maybe even some level of fear are empire
citizens apathetic to one another because they fear
and do not trust one another no knowing who will turn
around to back stab them or player kill them in an
ambush or declare war on them is this maybe what
prevents empire citizens form developing a
wequote no i do not think it is a lack of trust in
general i do not think it has anything to do with fear i
do not think the average high sec carebear of which i
speak knows enough about the game or game
mechanics to develop either a lack of trust or fear
seriously have you tried speaking to high sec
carebears about thingsin your question i think you
credit the basic carebear with too much insight there
have already been great changes in the game eg the
end of awoxing the end of war decs with character
logonoff info that have done a lot to benefit high
sec carebears but most of us do not know it sad
but true oh so trueas it stands war decs are easy
to avoid simply corps reform
as an aside i got booted from the minerbumping
channel when i tried to invite them to the discussioni
will probably post the chatlogs such as they are on
my blog later203326 leconte boudreaux  ive
updated myself on what ever lorelei ierendi was on
about shes running for hisec csm weve already
got a savior203639 hero of hisec  i doth not

typical politiciannoone there has actually read my
threads or anything i have said typical high seci
guess when i run next year they will also be getting
all uptight about how i dont consider their playstyle or
appreciate their content or whatever well suckers
you had your chances i dont wanna hear any more
of your complaints
oh and there was me thinking that a minerbumper
would say something about their saviour who once
was in the running for csm until he withdrew ever
heard the interview
i will withdraw my prior post on your count of
relevancyi also object to your reference of james 315
and his interview on the ground of relevance i find it
unrelated this threat on the grounds that it is being
used to discourage the merit of my post on behalf of
the new order of hisec on account that i am acting as
my own individual and request that you withdraw it as
well
is high sec an amorphic entity in the hands of npcs
and not the players
yes
thank you i shall be sure to quote you as above
do you also agree
the answer to that question is contained in the above
threadi hate answering the same question over and
over again if you took time to read what i wrote you
would not need to ask this questionthank you for
coming
hi its nice to see a candidate with a focus on high
sec ive a couple of questions for you if youve the
time what are your thoughts concerning the 310
ded site called rogue drone asteroid infestation do
you often run this specific site why or why not
what is your position on the subject of reputation
grinding via missions do you believe it is fine the
way it is or would you propose changes and why
what are your thoughts on npc corporations  what
are your thoughts concerning the overall size of high
sec space too big too small just right and of
course whythanks in advance for your replies and
best of luck with your candidacy o7
thanks for stopping byi have no specific thoughts
about that particular site i cant remember specifically
ever having run it in general i found those sites either
too easy or terribly hard with little in the way of just
right i can make more isk doing other stuff i had a
question about standingsreputation already in this
thread from someone trying to promote their own
ideas maybe you should check that out
standingsreputaton have become increasingly
irrelevant over time i regret the time i wasted
grinding standings i notice no effect from them and
if i could earn better isk with better standings 
reputation then it is not enough isk more to motivate
me to grind with the changes regarding jump clones
and the arrival of citadels standings etc are
completely irrelevant for me now i think it would be
fun for capsuleers to be allocated to more npc
corporations than currently maybe even influenced
by standings otherwise the npc corporations are also
pretty much invisible and irrelevant for me and my
gameplay if anything it is too big i dont know why
concord would waste resources policing systems that
have no activity and there are very many systems
that are just lifeless honestly i was thinking it might
be fun to have the sec of a system fluctuate a tiny bit
depending on activity but i expect i will write more
on that after the elections

accordingly
hello loreleiit is not over until it is over late in the
campaign according to whom if there are still days
remaining for voters to vote you shoudl use themyes
there were votes involved in you answering the
questions of course so first let me say thank you for
answering and taking the time to do so the
questions to the best of your ability i was hoping for
more transparency and it feels like i am touching on
to some topics that are very politicized in nature but
its finenow you asked me some questions it is only
fair that i answer backyou asked why to expand high
sec but you did nto answer questions 1 and 2the
answer is more content more fun for the peopel who
are not interested in playing the empire building
game of nulsec or the aggression game of otehr
areas of evethis is what characterizes highsec in
reality you said yourself that you tried the ganking
and did you like it did you enjoy it is it you are
you a person who takes enjoyment in ruining
someone elses day just to prove to yourself that you
are better and have some illusory power over others
my guess is no becaue otherwise you would have
become a player killer yourself atr least you know
what it is all aboutso it is about more content and fun
for the niche of players who also play eve and are not
interested in fighting with other players as part of their
daily routine of fun in game see i do understand i
am standing in front of a mounten of a mindset here
and in reality i am not hoping that anything will
change for eveat least not before another similar
game releases there are a couple alreay in the
making so the chances are that a better game than
eve will release in the comming years before eve
decides to change the irony is that the advocates of
the status quo will also change game because all
their victims will moveseen it in so many other
games in the 20 years i have been playing mmorpgs
and especially of the oldshool sandbox type with full
pvp and full loot i am nto new to this settingbut i am
intent on letting my opinion and thoughts known
because many act like if these diverging opinions do
not texist and that everyone should file in to follow
blindly the narative and mindset that is
vehiculatedsuffice it to say my answer to your
question i havei have but it is not me i did not enjoy
it player killing for pleasure for mindset for profit
even is to me a parctice of low lives human beings
without ethics or honor murderers and criminals that
is all theya re and have no resepct from me no matter
their kill counts or anything else they think make
sthem somehow great the act to kill innocent
unsuspecting weaker vioctims is the act of a
cowardand it looks like eve is full of them thena
again this might be by design right this is the
dystopian part of eve where all the low lives gather
and the funny thing is the dystopia extends outside
of the game itself in these very forums in the meta
game too people who want to imporve the gaming
experience and gameplay are shunned and blamed
for it as well lolnot for long though to eves loss
mind you i do love pvp just not player killing and
while many in eve pretend that there is no difference
between the two there is onein any case not here
to make my case just here to reply to you  all the
best to you in the elections and wishing you fun
within the vastness of space
there has not been a reply to this so let me volunteer
onea way to make wars more meaningfull is to make
it consentual when wars in empire spacefirst of all
the system would make a distinction between corps
based in empire space or notso here is how it could
work in empire space war is declared by corp a vs
corp b corp a pays nominal fee of 50 mill war
declarations must be mutual in order to be war so
corp b must accept the war once acepted by both
corps all membership changes are locked for a
perriod of 4 weeks no one is permited to quit the
corp and no new recruits can be accepted the war is
on for 4 week cycles after four weeks there is a 24
hour negotiations window this is the time when
corps can recruit new members or members quit the
corp this is the time also for corps to negotiate
mutual peace agreement and put an end to the war if
not war is renewed for another 4 week cycle at any
time a war can end via a corp surrendering now
victories and surrenders would be recorded in war
historyin my experience such war mechanics are
much more meaningfull as people are in for war plan
accordingly have a reputation to defend and wars
are not used to simply serve as a money sink design
wise or a way to bully other corps wars are like this
a much more engaging activity for both sides and not
something to flee frombut most importantly much
more meaningful
