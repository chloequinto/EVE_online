no thats like saying that the people playing call of duty correctly are taking away the freedom of people who want to pretend that call of duty is a refugee saving simulatori hate to break this to you but you do not have any right to force the game to revolve around your delusions of how it should workno what it does is try and put handcuffs on the people who are playing the game correctly for the sake of the people who are not you do not have a right to be left alone in new eden anywhere so i ask you this why are you trying to weaken an already weak mechanic right now the defenders can snap their fingers and use the dec dodge exploit to make wars go away now you want to slap some wackassed conditions on the attackeryou can do that the moment people arent allowed to drop corp in a war how about that
the thing is you do currently have that optioni got sick of getting wardeced in highsec many years ago and shortly after i ended up moving out to nullsec wardecs dont mean  in nullsec pve industry mining exploration even missions are all available in nullsec lots of renter corps are recruiting or you can rent your own space the thing about living in nullsec is that you cant delude yourself into thinking youre safe all the timeif you want to avoid wardecs move to a place where they dont matter after a couple months living there youll learn how to deal with people out to get you and then even highsec wardecs wont matter to you because you now know how to see and avoid hostiles
damn you couldnt contradict yourself any harder if you tried besides the people who are not playing correctly feel the exact same way which brings us back to going around in circles for the tenth time this entire thread is not about wanting to be left alone its about high sec wardecs currently being used as a major griefing tool purposely disrupting a specific play style purely for the sake of disrupting it knowing that your enemy cant do anything in return that sht is broken and needs to be fixed noone in this thread advocates wanting the ability to be left completely alone because that would be silly in a game like eve what this thread does advocate though is that game mechanics should be fair for both sides in no circumstance should player group a be allowed to disrupt the game for player group b without player group b being able to do anything about itcurrently whenever a high sec industrial corp gets wardecced chances are they are outmatched in every way from the get go fighting back would only serve to entertain the wardeccers and thus prolong the war because hey they shoot back fun for a high sec industrial corp the only winning move during a wardec is not to fight and to deny the attacker their kills effectively making them waste the cost of the dec which means docking up or going to ridiculous lengths to move your operation for a week that can not and should not be the way the game works its as simple as thatnow you as a pvper on the attacking side of things may say well then go train pvp go out in t1 frigs if you cant defend your stuff youre not allowed to have it in the first place and all kinds of solutions that require defending players to adapt to your play style which brings me back tohigh sec wardecs are broken period this thread asks for a solution that makes both sides happy not something that makes one side happy like right now so instead of constantly pretending that everything is fine try placing yourself in the defenders shoes for a moment and try to find a middle ground so something productive comes out of this thread
pohtaytoe pohtahtoeone mans griefing is another mans gameplay there is no real line in the sand because griefing outside of how ccp defines it is purely subjectivei can claim that all industrialists miners and traders are griefing me and my playstyle because i have no ability to stop them from jacking up prices on the market outside of either doing market stuff myself or blowing up everything coming and going from a trade hubwelcome to eve where all play styles are interconnected to each other in some way the more interconnected certain opposing playstyles are the more they inherrently disrupt each other ex building versus destroying one cornerstone of eve is that the game itself allows you to do everything you want including upset other players this is intended because you affect other players with each action you take if you can build others can destroy it if you destroy others can build to stop itwelcome to the reality that every small lowsec group has to deal with on a daily basis except they have it worse because of capitals and hotdroppingif your enemy is bigger fly smarter andor fasterif your enemy is smarter fly bigger andor fasterif your enemy is faster fly bigger andor smarterif you enemy is all of the above make yourself as annoying as possible to not be worthwhilethat is classic defeatism bravowhat ever happened to the days when people would ask for ways to fight off unwanted wardecs has the griffin blackbird and other ewar ships become uselessi remember in the not too distant past that when eve university was war decced they would fly groups of ecm sensor dampening tracking disruption ships sure quite a few of them died but they made the entire war so frustrating for the aggressors they rarely declared war against them again and the losses never really mattered due to insurance and cheapo fittingsas i pointed out on the first pagepvpers have the learn the basics of pve industry trading and mining otherwise they have trouble managing their money and equipmentwhat makes pveers industrialists traders and miners so special that they should not have learn the basics of pvp and how to fight backmoreover another cornerstone of eve is if you cant defend it however you can you should not build it no one is exempt or given special consideration with regards to that ruleinstead of constantly pretending that everything is fine try placing yourself in the defenders shoes for a moment and try to find a middle ground so something productive comes out of this threadwe are already at the middle ground compared to where we were 5 years agothe biggest problem is not the system it is the mentality of the players that needs to change
while i agree highsec wardecs have some issues they lie in the lack of incentives to form and defend highsec corporations not in their ability to enable nonconsensual pvp between players eve is a pvp game highsec was always intended to be a place of conflict and struggle not a place players can do industry in the absence of risk but ok ill bite what is your solution to allow players who do not like to participate in direct ship pvp to avoid it without giving them they ability to optout of a war either before or after it has started ccp has already tried to solve these apparently contradictory positions with the current mechanics you are suppose to invite friends which you can do for free or hire mercenaries to defend you eve is a mmorpg if you dont like some aspect of the game ship pvp in this case you are suppose to find some people that do and offer your skills in this case industry or isk to complement your skills what you are not suppose to do is come to the forums and complain that the game is broken because you refuse to use the tools available to defend yourself i would be happy to discuss the merits of a specific proposal that would correct any imbalance with the current mechanics but from your posts you seem to have nothing specific to point to other than they are broken and used to grief eve is all about griefing your rivals  it is a competetive sandbox where we are all vying for power and riches  it is not a space utopia simulator where everyone gets along the last pass over the wardec mechanics gave all the cards to the defender free allies increased costs for the attacker etc plus the trump card of dec shedding by folding and reforming a corp being no longer considered an exploit i cannot see what else can be done to stack the deck in favour of the defender there is a place for industrialists in this game  building things is an integral part of eve if you find building things fun then there are ways you can do only that in the game but if so you will have to find allies somewhere to protect your assets because destruction is the opposite side of the coin and equally integral if you cannot accept both as part of eve then perhaps this is not the game for you
why why put a mechanic in the game that is too costly to use
indeed the changes to the scan mechanics is only doing it half way  we allready have a constant scan cirkle giving us intell about anoms in the system  why not make dscan automated aswell  ofc this would make life in wh more intresting 
from the first postif elected the single most important thing on my agenda is csm reformyou have been singularly uninformative about what exactly it is you intend to reform and how
greetings tora1 what do you think about completely removing faction police the npcs that chase neg sec status dudeswould it bring lots more content in highsec for example lowsec pirates like me freely roaming around and engaging other pirates  gankers pirates  gankers spending lots more time in space being potential targets to antigankers or whoeveri have no idea how this would affect ganking balance but maybe2 coupled with this and expanding on your hideout idea why not make highsec stations unaccessible to neg sec status players based on current progression 10 unaccessible to 20 and below etc neg status players could base in lowsec to roam highsec bringing more content to lowsec too now both sides of highlow gates could be camped  organized ganking ops such as code would probably need pos which would be attackable  more content here toomake space glamorous is eve dying or not ask the eveo deathometer
this is true which is why i thanked him for his honesty weve run into corps that are all yeah yeah we run clean comms when theyre recruiting us and then we go to the trouble of moving out joining them getting on comms and its a stream of lazy language ive learned to appreciate people who are upfront about how they choose to do thingsbut my point wasnt that hes doing it wrong its that its not his motives or personal beliefs that are the issue as his if youre asking sentence assumes the mere presence of the language is enough to put some people off
yes u re right and so is june u can find alot of recordings of my comms on u tube feel free or join in on a roam i dont mind 10 k poeple available for fleets means 10 k different people  i dont mind rude language as long as its not pointed to harm a individual that is present i am not running a children day care centre but a x rated game when it comes to adult language eve has shown with charity drives and horrible things that happen that we care people mail me your fleets keep me from alot of bad stuff but u ll find me cursing for sure if i welp a fleet  being the least if i aim that at a solo person however in aim ti hurt him that woudl suck i like to think my comms are a reflection of rl sometimes worse and sometimes better as much as eve is a sandbox so is comms u can make of it as u please so i hope if u ask my fleet membes they ll say there is alot of respect for eachother respect fir eahcother rl things and at the same time we laugh our balls off and i would use the word balls u re more then wlecome to listen in sometime 
super fast probing is an indivisible part of the op bomber metathere needs to be a good way to interfere with on grid probing ecm bursts i dont even know something
given that scanning is currently so fast that ccp had to deliberately position probes at sun by default in order to keep the process from breaking the game maybe it wouldnt be such a bad idea to revisit that decision maybe scanning for full precision would take a long time but you could stop the process midway for goodenough results if you needed speed i dont know im just spitballing but it would add a bit of depth to the minigame
this reminds me of something from sins of a solar empire and therefore i love itbut first we as players would need actual smallscale deployable structuresgunsbombsetcthe problem is that i would assume with so much cargo space to deploy these types of tactical structures one could just keep deploying and keep deploying and keep deploying until the entire space is filledfor this concept there has to be a form of limiting factor as well as range factor minimum range between two deployables or something on the lines of that to prevent just a mass swarm of turrets around a single location or a mass grouping of armor repairers making a single ship nighinvulnerableeither way trench warfare sounds like it fits into the universe pretty well and might provide smaller alliancescorps more options when wardecd as well sure would also make setting up proper cynos and covert cynos stressful in order to hit the key targetslocations
in part i do not have a problem with the jump fatigue on the other hand with it and the nerfing the carrier jump range it takes an entire day to move 30 jumps honestly i have a carrier that i cant use anymore i trained up for it so i was usefull but now im not by haveing both it just seems over kill
the only way highsec wardecs are broken right now is that they can be trivially dodged with 100 success rate fix that and we can talk about weakening them in any way until then since they are 100 voluntary thanks to the dec dodge exploit you do not get to even hint about nerfing wardecs a middle ground doesnt mean taking things away from one side if you want a middle ground then it starts with giving up dec dodging period
the issue would be easally solvable if the defending corp could bribe concord to end the war with say equal amount of isk to stop the war cold as the aggresor would pay to start it
that is a way to opt out of the war and kinda breaks the purpose of them plus it is a blatant example of isktanking and would totally favour older established players and render new players completely impotent this suggestion is bad game design and wont be implemented plus if you think this will give you increased safety you might be surprised to find out just how deep the pockets of your enemies actually are
heres an idea take away all sovrelated timers allow systems to pingpong back and forth for a period of say 7 days during pingponging the station becomes freeported now you have occupancy sov where the strongest group of people who live locally are going to be the ones that hold onto the system huge blob just rolled through your constellation no prob they just left undock and take the system back again rendering the blob irrelevanttheres a bunch of ways that ccp could do occupancy sov im really keen on seeing what they present in two or three weeks time but yeah whatever they do it has to render the blob and in effect coalitions irrelevant
you only need to do it once you can continue to gank at 10 as proven by a lot of gankers the only time you need to pay that is when you decide you want to reuse that character for something else then its just click consequences undone
gully alex foyle  i wouldnUFFFDt be against removing the faction police so we would see more players with 5 or lower in highsec interaction between highsec and any other part of eve can only be good it also shows players from highsec that there is more then just highsec where most start in there are enough players in highsec to still shoot them so i donUFFFDt really see the need for the policemaking highsec stations unaccessible is not something i would support right now unless someone could convince me why itUFFFDs really good idea if negative status players could only base in lowsec wouldnUFFFDt that affect the highsec players on the edge of highsec more then the center 
brain fart  what would happen if ccp reduced the jump fatigue if youre travelling in your own sov 
thanks for replyyes my thoughts exactlymake space glamorous is eve dying or not ask the eveo deathometer
then blocs seize and maintain island systems to allow then to more rapidly project power over a larger area of the map
true but then you are also taking more risk and wouldnt it make sense that when you move in your own sov it should be easier to move around then when going to enemy sov 
the way ganking is right now they pretty much just need to see the fittings calculate the number of catalysts they need and then warp to the target code has industrialized ganking not sure but they may even use a spreadsheet for itthe only change i see that would make any real sense without killing ganking or making high sec a theme park would be to add a random element to concord response times i am thinking a random number that either adds or subtracts from the response time you could get a 5 second response in a 5 or maybe one that takes 45 seconds you just wont know you may even get enough time to kill multiple targets before they show up or loose all your ships with the target barely touchedits become too push button and easy they have the advantage since they know their target and exactly how many ships to bring having something they cant plan for would balance things out a bitsure they could just bring more ships but even that would make them work harder at it
is your car faster and more maneuverable in your home townim skeptical of the idea of eliminating faction police for two reasons1 it would not necessarily show people that theres more to the game than high sec so much as it would change the nature of what high sec is i dont necessarily think it would be a bad change but it would probably not work the way anyone expects it to2 if the npc factions cant even police their own space what is the point in having them at all eliminating them homogenizes high sec eliminates terrain even if its relatively featureless terrain on a huge scale and removed one extra bit of depth and complexity from the gamefaction police are pretty useless anyway i had another characters corp join factional warfare on the opposite side of the faction whose space they were in and their destroyerpve fit not at all fitted or rigged for align timeundocked and made it back to friendly space with no extra effort on my part the only thing faction police do is announce hollow threats at gates and keep hostiles from flying in anything approximately cruiser size or larger getting around is easy
mike azariah will be on my ballot this year i do not always agree with him but i think hes a great asset to the csm
mannyive been impressed by your thread and responses so faryou are on my short list for csm definitely one of the things that i like about your platform is to get into the nitty gritty of flying and balancing combat for not just big fleets but small gang  solo as well few questions for you1 im curious about your thoughts on the upcoming recon balance that ccp rise has put on the table for proteus lot of debate back and forth on dsan immunity t2 resists for recons and frankly the role of the ships ie stealthy recon vs electronic warfare platformhard to do both 2 what can we do to get battleships more interesting to fly they are the face of pve but fall behind dramatically at pvp as a side note it would be kinda nice to actually intentionally undock a raven for pvp instead of just shooting red crosses 3 i noticed you specifically mentioned missiles as something that needed some work to make them more viable in pvp work i tend to run missiles and drones pretty exclusively and you are spot on what would you propose to ccp and the community to make the missile weapons family more competitive4 how will you reach out to other facets of the community outside the big fleet scene hopping in npsi roams blogging etcthanks for your time  look forward to seeing your responses cheers biomassed  dust  eve podcast
simple question why should voters choose you over your fellow alliance member and csm candidate manfred sideous
i fully support manfred sideous even though his views sometimes may be different than mine manfred is probably one of the best players currently in game to come up with solutions related to pvp and alliance warfare this is a big advantage for him but it can also make him a bit more scarier to contact players this is where i can come in play im used to contacttalk to all kinds of players and so i believe this could benefit me and the hopefully the future csm 10 teamtdlr  vote for us both to make the csm 10 team as strong as possible
thank you for your post and interest it is a wild turn to mention an additional skill book on the list of many but many other options that could exist like inventing or allowing boosters implants equipment that boost a work team skills that wouldnt add to any players time on skill building thank you for you comment
u have an interesting platform the problem is  ur potential voters are casual players most of them dont care about reading forums  so youll have a hard time rallying the troops so to speak still good luck to you
i understand you are frustrated  they are after all just using a mechanic that has been in the game for many many years if you make the csm but ccp fails to change afk cloaking how long will it be until you suspend your account and have to resign from the csm snip removed a reply to an edited out part of the quoted post isd ezwal

why would the laws of physics change when youre at homelook the whole point of the jump fatigue mechanic is to stop large forces rapidly moving long distances without consequence so far its working reasonably well and if someone does want to make a large amount of instant travels very quickly the option remains open to them its just that theres a cost

see with logi i strongly believe that the problem isnt in the strength of the logi modules itself but in the way they scale 1 triage carrier with a gang is not inherently too powerful it is when you have 10 or 100 carriers present that it simply becomes impractical bordering on impossible to kill anything which is why i would like to see some sort of change whether it is resistances being killed or simply a cap to how many remote repair modules can be activated on a ship at once i hope my previous post didnt come across as too hostile i look forward to reading up on your full en24 list and joining your ingame channel

if ccp want to retain players who just want to pve and manufacture then there needs to be a way for the subscribers to opt out of warsi know it comes as a total shock that there are many many subscribers that never pvp  they have not the time interest to commit to the hours pvp operations consumethey enjoy playing the elements of the game that ccp have developed mission arcsexplorationminingnot pvp if the only option is to be in an npc corporation then theres a problem with the social gaming mechanismsyes there needs to be a war mechanism and avoiding it should have heavy penaltiesie if you may pay higher taxes to concord higher refine   not permitted to deploy pos towers pocosmaybe even docking rights are restricted  gates blockedthis gives the fledgling corporations a chance to establish themselves and choose to deploy a pos make the step up to compete with the pvperslikewise make the war statistics count for something as an incentive for the experienced industrialistpve pilot to work out the correct end to load ammo into a turretstandings increases in the territory of the corp base of operations tax bonuses larger alliances such as mine can then choose where we position ourselves and the risk  exposure we are prepared to defendno doubt we would still be war decd every week implementing all the usual standard operating proceduresbut we would have a reason to engage the enemy instead of just avoiding giving them the pvp and kills they wantas tess said this is just going to go round the housespvp pilots dont get it that indi guys want to just indi and pveand pve pilots dont understand why tears are so valuable
this isnt going roundandround  pretty much everyone here agrees you should be able to play the game as you like but the point some are forgeting is that if you want the rewards of a significant industrial operation you need to defend it the core of what you ask is in the game already  the npc corp it is the place you are suppose to fall back to if you lose everything or where you can start out if you want a social corp that has the same restrictions but with a player created name and a corp channel then you will find a lot of supporters for that including mebut pve and industrial players have to understand that the benefits they are extracting from the sandbox come at the cost that other players might object and try to stop them there cannot be a way to opt out of wars for competitive corps or many things will break in the sandbox so do not expect to ccp to move much on that sure newcasual players should be able to dabble in pve and industry in relative safety less efficiently but as soon as they are competing with the big boys they need to be disruptable and they also need to understand that players that do this arent griefing in the eula breaking sense but rather just applying competitive pressure on rival players in the sandbox we all live in playing solo andor with npc protection in highsec should never be the optimal or most efficient way to pursing iskmaking activities or what would be the point in players expending the effort and cost to secure their own space or organization this is just basic game design of a sandbox game if you just like playng casual then sure be my guest and play as you like but dont expect to make the same income as someone who is expending the effort to defend themselves or has made an arrangement with a pvp group to do that for them besides if you are just building things and never actually spending all the isk you are accumulating on combat then what do you need the most efficient iskmaking operation for anyway
did i miss the memo eve is still run by bob last time i checkednothing ever changes balance is something you do on a bikethat is all
that is indeed the best form of protest mass account suspension
many are banging on about having more bob on the old csmi really should not have to educate people as to the emergence and truth behind james and codecode hc  shills or at the very least they are guided by shillsremember james came from goonwaffe and they are part of bob bob  ccp and ccp make money on every plex bought on every high sec gank
if i win a seat on csm otherwise there are weaknesses in most mechanics of most mmos that players use that they exploit them to fullest extent makes them in my eyes patheticit is indeed difficult i need help so watch kill boards for people that might be interested and spread the message pleasein the interview this idea was discussed grabbing it from here to talk about it futherokay so as i said sov structure that can be used to defend a systemhowever i also like the idea of force recons being used for more targetted anticloak work and how i think they could work dscan cloaked ships with a distance no matter how far within the 2au range can probe scan general area of a cloaked ship but not pin point it can see through cloaks can target cloaked ships this does not decloak them and targetting has an optimal 100 within 5km and falls offs to 0 over 25km away then they can either get within 2km to decloak them or neut their cloaks off can fire on cloaked ships but again this wont decloak them the important aspect is that there is a limit to how many ships they can decloak and how they do it not just a mobile complete system wipe
not all corporations are created equal when new player experience is concerned the kind of corporations often targeted by highsec pirates are barely if at all above npc corporations in their ability to serve new players small highsec mining or mission running corporations should be left to those who are old and experienced enough to know what they are doing and should absolutely not be recommended as a starting point for new players solo hs carebearing is all fine and good but it it should be reserved for those who are truly dedicated to their carebearing ways against popular opinion it is not a suitable environment for fresh players and definitely not a good starting point for those still unsure of what kind of content they want from this gamei have seen a lot of people run a few missions or mine a few droids either solo or in a small highsec corp and unsubmit out of boredom and due to a feeling of irrelevance the players who i have seen become active content creators and active players have more often than not been those who have been engaged and pulled along for meaningful content by established null low or wh based groups everyone can use a lowsp scout or a hero tackler so there is no reason not to take the newbie along for the ridethe finnish speaking player community has this excellent player retention system called suomi op where players from established corporations run public pvp operations open for everyone who speaks the language this has been a major contributing factor for player retention among those few newbies who are fortunate enough to find out about it these operations have given new players a taste of the kind of game play they might otherwise not have encountered at all before unsubmitting and have also helped give a lot of established carebears a taste of what making things explode feels likethe realization that the markets are full of replacement ships and that the scary parts of eve arent actually that scary at all when you are no longer alone and miserable is an important experience for both the newbie and the veteran carebear i strongly recommend player outreach programs such as this to everyone else as well not least since they are an excellent excuse to get totally drunk with strangers on teamspeak kudos to newbiefriendly veterans such as mauno materialisti lacco ugly eric shana tirii and others for contributing to my retention trough suomi op when i was a clueless newbie
marmite collective sorry but no vote from me
you have my vote please lets get the warp speed of battlecruisers back to before ccp have killed them since they were nerfed
that is a hell of a lot more work than our pray has to do they ap trough highsec or sit afk in the belts if they dont it gets a lot more complicated to kill them so what you actually want is to complicate or increase the cost of an active play style to secure your afk play style which is already ridiculously secure even more ganking can be countered easily by active players like it should be in a sandbox what you want is another buff to the automatic npc defense of your pilotless and untanked shipi would be interested what toras opinion is on the subject
i understand eve is about feelings but the csm shouldnt be we are at war with the cfc for a year now but i would still vote for one of them if i think they can do a good job if you think i couldnt do that job then you re right dont vote for mei agree on this but i still want to add something for the active antiganking to be able to get a fight
sorry but you dont seems to show any ability to practice what you say you seems to dont be able to deal with poeple you disagree with i really think you have a lake of capacity to listen other and if you cut dialogue then it really means you are not made for it despite of ignore feelings deal with it this is a job of a csmyou seems to have a too strong biased point of view to be objectiveedit  the purpose of the csm is  to represent society interests to ccp this requires active engagement with the player community to master eve issue awareness understanding and evaluation in the context of the greatest good for the greater player base you do the exact opposit with your marmite alliance you are not able to solve a simple conflict or issue to understand or evaluate a context my experience with you showed me that your ambitions in general are way to high wanted to become a csm is your right but if you are honest with yourself retrieve your proposition to do it

nice to see you running again for csm thanks for your time and effort for the past year representingits good to know someone is out there fighting the good fight for the hisec part of the community as a personal favor could you please keep both eyes on ccps greed is good view concerning neural remappingregards a freelancer
you have my vote i have a question though do you have any ideas on how to improve the bounty system
i think it broadly does the right thing at the moment but that the 20 figure is too low if attacking a bounty target awarded 3540 of the net loss value it would be more lucrative and might incentivise attacking people rather than just functioning as a tip to people that would have shot you anywayinitially the bounty system was set to pay 20 in order to address exploit concerns these were justified  i personally reported two exploits at the time of the retribution launch the big one podding someone with a gold pod installed was hotfixed within hours by removing the gold pod implant from killmailsi believe changing it from 20 to 40 would not introduce new exploits but would make larger bounties more of a conflict driver suddenly it becomes worth your gank fleet targetting the code battleship with our alliance bounty over the carebears inc battleship with minimalno bountysecondly i think the bounty system would be improved by reworking insurance i should make a major post on this at some point as my thoughts on insurance will probably be controversial i believe insurance payments to high sp players should be sharply decreased while keeping large payments to rookies and have an only partly thought out idea for doing this as insurance is such a large factor in the bounty payment formula any nerf to insurance will improve bounty payoutsone final point a common criticism of the bounty system is troll bounties  ie bountying someone for a trivial amount for the lulz i dont see these as an issue as bounties of under 50 million isk generally make no difference to pvp engagement decisions
nice to see one of the last fun bastions in nullsec to be represented provi has a place in my hart since i flew there for freelancing purposes not to be an f1 monkey or obey blue donut agendas made by people who dont even log in the game anymorewhat is your view about the direction of the nullsec make up now that phoebe freeport republic is out there grabbing some sov 
thanks first for the suppot in regards to recons i see them serving 2 separate purposes cloaking recons are well covert and by nature should be more focused on hit  run and things of that nature whereas the combat recons would be amazing if they were beefier and able to be a part of main fleets on the front line applying superior ewar power as it is they are super flimsy and you see people using t3s if i were the one balancing them the lachesis would have low dps high tankbuffer potential whereas the arazu would have higher dps and lower tank but they both would enjoy the same ewar bonus as far as not showing up on the scanner i can see this being a decent bonus for the stealth reconbattleships are easy to tackle you fix 3 things one combat probing needs to be changed two bombing needs to be changed three missiles need to be immune to firewall but in exchange there needs to be counterplay to missiles perhaps a midslot item that launches chaff that disrupts the accuracy of missilesi plan to be very communicative once on the csm with post on the eveforums and other fan sites ive been known to participate in several podcast and radio shows as well as interviews this will continue to be true
thanks for the responsei like your idea on the combat reconsurvivability in stead of pure dps and they can preform admirably im admittedly a bit concerned my rook will still be overshadowed by he t1 blackbird falcon and t3s at this point just about anything that can help missile systems will be welcome and you idea of counters to them could be pretty niftyagain thanks for answering and good luck in the election biomassed  dust  eve podcast
10010 would not bang
1 psianh will make a great addition to csm
in every pvp game ive played all those years there has always been a hunter killer able to go after cloaked characters and sometimes dedicated mostly to thatwhy not make the force recon the recon without cloak supposed to be the ultimate ewar platform able to scan down and hunt cloaked ships if the cloaked pilot is active he can see the recon coming to him and warp to another bookmark but if he is afk hes dead meatwhen close enough the force recon can target which breaks the cloak and the rest is history 
really good answers1 would vote
the real issue is that eve has a core of antisocial neckbeard incumbent players who throw a storm about anything that isnt directly gameplay relatedthey did this last time when wis was originally added and ccp panicked and killed the project outright i would have much preferred they give them the finger and finish fleshing wis theyll definitely pick up players when they have avatars that they can connect to as more than a ship
they actually threw a fit over micro transactions for fear of eve becoming pay to win do your researchi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
ahh i thought they were two separate fits but close chronologically i just remember a lot of posts about barbies in space
and pvp pilots dont understand why industrial and pve players feel they are entitled to affect the rest of the game without being affected backin this game no one gets exactly what they want i just want to pvp every time i log in but i cant because pvp requires money which i have to pay industrialists and pveers or do industry or pve myselfin other words the moment i can opt out of the economic system of eve that is the moment industrialists and pveers can opt out of shipsonship violenceyou cant have your cake and eat it too
its funny how you mention tears as its emotive and you use it in an attempt to bolster your claims the trouble is youre on weak ground in that regard the tears only come after extremely poor reactions from your side this can include foul language talk of things about ones mother sexuality race wishing all ones family cancer death threats and a generally bad attitude towards others gaming stylenow there are many who actually are playing a game and talk to us they ask for advice and understand the game they are playing there has even been occasions i have given isk to pilots i have just blown up mostly due to their attitude and giving them a leg upso i find your attempt at playing the tear card rather a hollow one its not about the tears players only use that to wind up poor players of the game the ones with no qualms about offering up death threats or turning a blind eye to them when others doand once again there are no pve only pilots i know you dont like to hear it but its fact all your so called 8 year pve veterans are 8 year pvp ones pvp includes but is not limited to ship combat it also involves industry mining missions etc etceve is pvp centric it revolves around conflictcompetition if you really do not want that then play on the test server youll find the perfect place for your needs no player conflictcompetition find a little system somewhere and mine build mission to your hearts contentof course you wont why well itll be boring as hell because there will be no player conflictcompetition funny thatdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
over the last year weve seen the most progress on the api in a long time for ensuring that continues i expect steve to place well on my ballot for another year
i am going to clarify some things in hopes to avoid distractionsadvocating for csm reform is in the context of my platform apolitical you dont need to be a veteran eve player to understand that my allegiances are to my own values my corp history is indicative of that when i say that i want to change policy i am refering specifically too the csm whitepaperas referenced before the csm is not at any point during campaigning required to tell the truth they are also not prohibited from buying votes the extreme of this being spending real life money to buy eve accounts ahead of the deadline for the sole purpose of padding the voting process its very easy for opponents of my platform to ask how would you solve itwhat i think they dont understand is that the csm is not 1 person with absolute authority making decisions on what to do about the game the csm is a group of people consulting with ccp and advocating collectively for changes and ideas they feel are important asking me in any specificity how i would fix or solve a problem assumes that any 1 person can walk into the room press the right button and all will be well my platform is incongruous with any mentality that a single person should without oversight be able to make a judgment call and subsequently execute the consequences of that judgment the flaws in the current voting system not only allow for such outcomes but incentives them
corbexx has done a hell of a job hes taken allot of initiative and continuously interacts with the communitywhere he gets the energy from to voluntarily put himself in front of a gaggle of eve wormholers asking him to make the sun rain wormhole fixes i have no clueplus 10 good sir you both deserve and earned it
i secretly wear tshirts with his name on
for what its worth i am primarily an incursion runner and an fc for warp to me and while mike is my obvious representative on the csm id probably vote for corbexx instead since i much prefer his stance he seems to be alot less dogmatic and alot more okay i might be wrong but lets find out and see whats what not sure if thats worth anything but its something you might like to consider

i will chip in and say that core is rather charismatic on comms it is where he shines maybe it was raising kids that gave him the right attitude we had an easy to happen but big mess up recently a wing commander wanted to right click through something and warped his wing off from a fight suddenly we went from holding to losing and everyone that could had to just bail outcore didnt freak out he didnt yell abuse he just absorbed it voiced some exasperation disappointment and then commiserated with how bad the guy must be feeling about what happenedcore did you give the mach pilot something he was doing just fine until all this happened no pilot error on his behalfanother example is where we flew head long as a worm hole alliance core saw a black ops ship on his overview and asked the guy if he was seriously going to bring that the guys said he wasnt and was just messing about next thing there he is in a full on fight and lost it logi remarked how it folded so incredibly fastresponse words to the effect of that is why you dont bring black ops into a full on fight bit of light chastisement to show it had been noticedcore is good well balanced if you want a fc that really knows how to stay frosty have a look for jintaan he sounds like he plays the game while getting a massage in a hot bath with candle light and incense after meditating to find his inner serentiy

sugar kyle has definitely earned a repeat spot on my csm ballot for this year
with the starting of the new year i am proud to announce my candidacy for csmxmy name is jayne fillon and ive been playing this wonderful game without pause since early 2012 like many the sandbox nature of eve was overwhelming to me at first and i struggled to find my place in new eden after a very brief stint in highsec running missions i joined a small pvp corp in syndicate only to be robbed soon after joining from there i tried to start my own wormhole corp which failed early on finally i moved onto lowsec where i tried unsuccessfully to become a mercenaryat this point i was on the verge of quitting the game and would have had i not found the npsi communitymy love for the npsi community started over two years ago  eight months after i started playing  and i have not looked back since my experience flying npsi helped me learn how to pvp and eventually led me to become a fleet commander before i knew it i was the ceo of a successful pvp corporation  and from there i founded a completely new npsi channel called UFFFDspectre fleetUFFFD where i spend most of my timemy eve story is far from unique  ive heard countless stories just like itunfortunately unlike mine these stories often end with UFFFDi was on the verge of quitting the game and then i didUFFFDout of all the the things npsi showed me the most important was the need to be engaged in what you do playing this game alone is not enough you have to be an active participant within the community to truly experience eve the community as a whole is what makes this game fun itUFFFDs why we stay the community is the sole reason why we still log in despite no shortage of other games to entertain us despite all this the tools players have to facilitate forming groups and playing together are severely lackingthankfully ccp is aware of these complaints and are actively taking steps to address the current issueslast year during the fanfest keynote speech ccp seagull outlined eve onlineUFFFDs development roadmap there were two main focuses during 2014 industry released with crius as well as a redesign of corporations and alliances the latter topic was discussed during the summer summit with csm9 and the details were published in the meeting minutes later that year the twelve page section covering team fiveoUFFFDs meeting with csm9 placed the scale and difficulty of this project into perspectiveUFFFDfozzie explained that ccp had their external testing partner come in and map out corporations and alliances the information was so thick and obscure that there were things no one knew about  the partner company has produced a one hundred and five page document  that explains the current corporation and alliance system and how it relates to the rest of eveUFFFDunsurprisingly during the eve vegas keynote speech in october a new development roadmap was released listing the redesign of corporations as an ongoing project this means that whether you like it or not redesigning corporations has become a priority for ccp and will be the precursor to both sovereignty warfare and starbase management this is an important project this project will lay the foundation of future releases and development and it goes beyond just corporations and allianceswhether itUFFFDs been called UFFFDcorp liteUFFFD by csm9 funkybacon or UFFFDsocial groupsUFFFD by csm9 mangala solaris  there is a need for something more than what the traditional corporation structure can provide there are a myriad of groups operating all over new eden who operate outside of the current corporation and alliance mechanics nullsec sigs highsec incursion groups roleplayers and lore aficionados gankers and antigankers podcasters traders bloggers and of course the npsi communities themselvesnone of these groups operate in game with anything other than a chat channel and a mailing listthere is literally nothing else in game for these groups to use and this needs to changethe list of things that could and should be either tweaked or completely redesigned is rather substantial but im confident that with my experience both as a corporate ceo and leader of the largest channel based community in the game i can help ccp make the right decisions if you are a part of any of the communities i listed above you should know that your most vocal advocate on the current csm mangala solaris has elected not to run for another term let me be your voice in his stead and help ccp create an eve that promotes and encourages social interaction building a stronger eve community cheersjayne

jayne has been a personal friend of mine for well over a year now we both share a very similar focus when it comes to our own ingame activities and our ambitions for those around us his promise to focus on corplitesocial groups and tools to help those groups is very close to my heart and i am happy to see he will take up that mantleas a result i am proud to say jayne earns an easy endorsement from me hell be 1 on my ballot he best be 1 on yoursnow for a quick question or two jayne how have you found the new eve of the past 8 months or so since the release cadence changed to 6 weekly expansions is this something you support and will work with ccp on to ensure they do not stray from this new found path of goodnesswhat is your view on the rebalancing efforts of late notably recons and of course the continuing efforts at module tiericide
met jayne at eve vegas nice guy hell be somewhere on my ballot
jayne would actually be a reasonable choice for csm  fleet commander knows how to herd cats  how to craft dank doctrines  community leader he made something thats actually not   didnt let it failcascade within the first 2 months  not bad with words apparently he writes for some spaceshipnewspaper  will pretend to listen to you  canadian  csm1questionmanaging npsi fleets in its current form is a major pain in the ass  what featuresideas would you advocate to ccp to improve the management of npsi fleets  fleets in general i am aware that this is a big topic  3 key pointsideas if you have any
having flown under  and with  jayne for a decent amount of fleets and hearing him talk about these subjects i can confidently say he is suited for the jobyou have my vote
before my stint in wormholes i flew with jayne virtually every day this guy knows what he is talking about 1 vote from me

this is the perfect year to have you on csm youll be prominently placed on my ballotam i correct in assuming that youd like nonalliance communities to be able to have their own logos at least if theyre large enough do you think players should be able to submit their own designs or assemble them from provided bits as is done with the admittedly dated and archaic corp logo system maybe both
in regards to the faster release cadence ive been extremely impressed with the rate at which ccp has been churning out new features  and good features at that i feel that the flexibility of this system compared to the older 6 month release cycle has given the developers the freedom to be more brazen with their changes knowing that they can tweak them if they dont bring the desired or at least beneficial results  see the removal of industrial teams for an example i think that ccps old rigid release cycle hindered development and if they need to stray from the current release cycle a week forward here a week delay there etc then this system gives them the flexibility they need to make it happen and they absolutely shouldmodules tiericide is awesome for everyone  except probably entity who i assume is crying into pools of isk now that all his defunct and unique items are either being rebranded or removed oh well cant make everyone happy and the changes are certainly for the best as for recons specifically the dscan change this one plays on my heart strings for the simple reason that dscan immunity falls under a category of game design called an incomparable with a bit of nifty math you can quite easily determine which ships have the most dps or the most tank the most maneuverability etc however there is no way you can equate dscan immunity to having 100 more dps or something else equally quantitative hopefully i havent lost youwhat this essentially means is that there is no way to empirically determine if this feature will make recons overpowered or underpowered compared to other ship classes as their attributes are incomparable this is good game design as it forces players to move away from minmaxing and towards to use of tactics to best one another in combat ill indulge myself and take this one step further this leads to a state of play referred to as cyclic imbalance the recon upon first release will be widely considered as powerful if not overpowered until suitable tactics are created to counter them at which point those mechanics will come under scrutiny now you need ongrid scouting of enemy fleets etc etcthat being said i can see dscan immunity wreaking havoc in faction warfare im sure ccp isnt oblivious to these dangers but their effects in lowsec warfare will have to be closely monitored to ensure it doesnt lead to less fights and an even more risk averse playstyle that would  i assume  be the opposite of what is intendedfake edit i reread the post ccp rise had already commented of the dangers of dscan immune recons in fw
ah so we only have to choose between you two then
oh christ that list is massive youre asking about specifically npsi fleets1 fleet standings either manually set or inherit from fc2 more options in fleet adverts saved presets etc3 more granular fleet channel and mailing list rolesit pains me to just pick three but there you go for more you should check out the discussion here or again watch my presentation from eve vegas where i talk about this near the end the link is in the op
ganking in highsec is in a good place overall imho ive both ganked and been ganked multiple times every time ive been ganked ive either been afk or taken too large of a risk everytime i gank im impressed with the amount of organization required to pull it off successfully if you want to make a profit from ganking the complexity of an operation increases even furtherthat being said highsec as a whole is not in a good place overallthe reason for this was summarized beautifully by sion kumitomo in the csm9 summer summit minutes  which is wrong on so many levels its unbelievable why are there no incursion corporations or alliances what about mission running or mining corporations why does highsec not have the same storied history that inspires historians to write booksi speak to these issues in particular because you left your question open ended and i know you are personally invested in the wardec mechanics which i believe is in dire need of an overhaul and has been in need of one for a long time ill leave it at that for now but if you want a more detailed response please be more specific ill be happy to answer
i would support anything that helps give these groups of players a sense of belonging such as a collective symbol or identity to rally around think of how important the bee has become in goon culture or the phage or pandemic legion or even middle management dino from testit doesnt overly matter to me what medium is used to create these as both player created or provided tools would work but there has to be something even simple cosmetic items such as logos or tickers often hold a lot of meaning for players this has become an issue with new alliance logos being delayed indefinitely which is something that hopefully gets resolved soon
1 for june shes got the time motive and background to represent

sion youll get a spot on my ballot o7
well after the holidays and being sick as a space hooker on labor day i am back and ready to go i will be updating the blog shortly with some more points and campaign argumentscheck out my podcast my blog
i guess i am technically part of the multiboxer community as you so eloquently describe and i definitely do not feel misrepresented at all in fact i feel happy with the jan 1st changes and if anything am more content with ccps current approach and general attitude to the changed tos and eula than previouslynot wanting to rain on your parade or anythingthough have to say good on you for finding a usp to separate yourself from the crowd of csm hopefuls
i am glad you are happy for the changes i agree it pulls more out of the grey area than was previously but it also caused alot of issues and generated more questions that simply need answered check out my podcast my blog
well if your interests in bringing 3rd party multiboxing issues to ccp is to further reduce the area of grey that lies between whats for and against the tos and eula for the purposes of closing any loopholes that may potentially exist then i could support that but if youre gunning for finding loopholes to exploit then thats more than objectionable in my eyeshowever such a venture would not be outside the spirit of previous ventures by many eve players some might say it can be said to somewhat define an eve online player from other mmos or multiplayer games
suzy just so you know i grabbed the above post
im going to keep this short and simple i have been living in low class wormholes for several years and have lived through many changes some good some not so good ive also lived in lowsec for the same amount of years i have 7 accounts 10 toons not counting cyno alts  i feel i can represent very well the interests of the everyman in new eden bringing to the center stage those issues and concerns we live with on a daily basis as a professional in real life i understand commitment and communication and if elected to the csm you will get both from mevote starbuck for csm in 2015
1 am inspired
good dude 1
profile not smug enough no dramallama in thread lack of dragons1
why should i vote for you vs for jayne
thanks for your question you should vote for us both we represent different interest groups
can you please explain in more detail i know what interest groups jayne represents but i have a much less clear view how your perspective is different from jaynes
thanks june to be clear jaynes and my campaign are not at all related its true we fly together and i do fly and fc npsi from time to time but while jayne is running to represent the npsi community im running to represent the smalltime operator as i indicated in my candidacy post to witas you well know thanks to your altruistic efforts in helping players eve is a confusing place but not just for new players players who have been around for a while and generally know what they want to do in new eden are still blocked in many ways from having a say or in being represented during the continuous development of the gameobviously in our world we know that the squeaky wheel gets the grease so to speak and so the major powers who have needs specific to their larger numbers are usually heard even the moderately sized groups have committed representation but what about the committed player who for example lives in a low class wormhole forums are a great tool and so is having a csm representative who can voice their perspective and regurgitate development back to that community its not an easy task because these folks tend to be somewhat nomadic or keep to themselves and so a new effort in including them and communicating their interests would be a welcome reliefi believe that at its core the csm is a liaison force who with as much effort as they put in to influencing development of eve have the responsibility to communicate to and for the citizens of new eden we have csm representatives today like sugar kyle who do this well and i too would endeavor to be such
id be interested in hearing the good and bad changes and what you think needs improving in w space both highera nd lower classes
there is something ive never quite understood about that ccp promised a lot of cool features with walking in stations they showed teasers of some different rooms and areas that looked really great then they didnt deliver people got upset because they didnt deliver ccp then decided that meant that we didnt want wis wtf how why someone sucked on the bong one too many times no well maybe tbhit was probably because a vocal minority played both sides but i still dont see how ccp could screw up so badly players rioted over the new eden store and the failure of ccp to deliver on wis how can that possibly be interpreted as the players not wanting ccp to deliver at alldo not run we are your friends
as mentioned in the other thread id rather see this as an industrial ship t2 bridging the gap between industrial and combat ships since it can field offensive power
read the other thread all i can say is that this would likely be a godsend for nullsec and wormhole corps who set up and tear down a lot of poses in regards to the proposed bonuses posted in the same thread  i could see some interesting usage of the light engineer and heavy engineers to severely cut down on the time required to anchor and online a posadditional thoughtsthe heavy engineers should be relatively speedy as most pos setups have a lot of offensive modules scattered 35km from both the tower and each other slowboating around to scoop them is a tedious processthe heavy engineer would also benefit from an ice products hold large enough to hold 1d17h of pos fuel not a cargo hold as thats a lot of space that would result in the ship being used as a fleet resupply tenderthe heavy engineers orbital infrastructure hold is a good idea but if you want to make it possible to scoop modules to it then there would need to be a bit of work done on fleet hangarsother specialized holds to make it possible to scoop pos modules to specialized holds
i like the changes as they are it means that instead of being able to throw huge fleets andor capitals at every problem that shows up deployments need to be thought out strategically yes its harder to move around but that means youre more likely to find similarsized fleets to fight without risking capital escalation by engaging
that was exactly the whole point of the change to make being 30 jumps away from somewhere actually mean something your carrier is still extremely useful its just not usable to help dunk on someone 3 regions away and get you home for tea with no consequences any moresince youre in test fights are coming to you pretty much daily in any caseedit incidentally you can use gates now it should take you no more than a couple of hours to go 30 jumps in a carrier  if you want to trade jump fatigue for risk
lets see how we can solv the 3 day thing really fast shall we you are in test which has sov your leaders need to add the wormhole upgrades in there ihubs and you scan your area ill bet you right now you have a wh in one of your systems that you can take that will most likely move you to an area you want to go or at the very least reduce your jump range you also have gates as in you jump someplace wait till cyno ends have your cyno pilot scout the way and you move via gates to get a tad closer to your next jump and maybe jump father no fatigue and fewer cynos the carrier is efficient as said above you can get there faster with higher risk or get there slower with less risk
hello councili am not sure if this is possible or even practical but what about implementing a loan contract into game for example you create a contract like a courier contract that secures a loan as well as interest allows younger budding traders the option to trade with more capital also allows for rich veterans to safely invest in other ventures i know the implementation of this would be hard because there is no way to secure future isk it would be cool if it worked as if the loan contract failed all the money would be returned minus some that is lost the other player would either go in the negative or have its assets wiped to keep this as scam free as possible maybe make the loan contract create a new wallet division like a corp wallet where the money can not be transfered between characters in order to keep track of it and the investor can see and track the progress anyways just me writing down my ideas would love to see something like this in the futurecheerssal goodman9
used to exist in eve but were removed because they were rarely used because you could just as easily sell the itemsstuff you were using as collateral for iskas for the rest of the idea it would be abused easily you can have throwaway alt characters either on the same account an alt account or a friends account take out massive loans buy a whole bunch of assets and then leave those assets in space for retrieval which effectively ends any paper trail as transferring assets in space is mechanically no different than stealing you can build massive ponzi schemes with multiple alts loan alt a which loan to alt b which loans to alt c which loans back to alt a and b which can then loan back to alts a b and c etc to completely fubar any paper trail and get massive amounts of money
dscans strength comes from surprisingly enough its directional ability sure it can be used to just see what else is in the system but by using its directional ability you can pinpoint where something is if you know what youre doing if we automate that ability the game would be waaaaaaaaaaay too easy
in order for a sabre to achieve a 2second warp they need to fit their ship out for align and warp speed combined with some expensive implants this severely limits their combat capabilities a retriever fit out similarly can achieve a 7second warp across a 16 au system if both pilots are reacting at the same time the sabre will never be able to catch the retriever because at the absolute best it can achieve for warp speed it will still take about four seconds to warp the retriever would have to be sitting at the belt warpin point for the sabre to catch them if the retriever were sitting opposite the warpin point across the belt there would be a 45 second burn for the sabre to get into longpoint distance or about 24 seconds depending on prop mod with an overheated pointthe retriever would be inwarp to a safe before the sabre could catch a pointof course if the retriever pilot were being diligent the sabre would never even see them on grid unless there are a very tiny number of belts as the sabre pilot would first need to locate the retrieverthis would be so gamebreaking that i cant even comprehend it being suggested it would take me less than ten minutes to write a script that monitored a section of a window that would plate a chime alerting me when something changed on it automatic dscan would pick up a ship this script would chime and a person would be alerted to the changethis script would be impossible for ccp to detect unless they were scanning my computer as a whole which if theyre doing that ill have a whole host of other issues with themcsm candidates should not need to be linked to these
doubleposting because of the fivequote limit sorryfrig holes came out with the hyperion release four months ago
eve is a game of shills and this is one of the first things you must learn to really get into the meat of it if you havent come to terms with this yet chances are you are not enjoying eve nearly as much as you could be reminds me of an argument i had with my brother who is more of a genius than i am and understands people better than i do but he was yet unable to fathom how players can enjoy playing eve he reasoned that one players enjoyment came at the cost of someone elses displeasure i could not come up with a suitable answer then but now i have given it a lot more thought and i realize that the reason so many of us can enjoy playing eve is because we can have fun not only winning against ships but also in losing ships or at least we have to enjoy the negative parts of eve that come with the positive we enjoy eve not only for those sweet moments of triumph but for the gritty underlying darkness of the game in generalpeople who dont enjoy the darker parts of their experience in some way will probably eventually quit no matter what we do to save them its just not their game
you are assuming the sabre is working solonew worm holes can pop up all the timedscan you clearly havent heard of clicking programs  devicies that can click a specific spot really rapidly at intervals and return your mouse to the previous positioni can talk about the antiafk cloak ideas that i supportsuicide ganking  again you assume that i have never taken revenge on someone in the pastand again you seem to think it is a solo activityyou also assume people will only do it for profityes i want to see the voting break down also high sec gives up the same way that spectre fleets are so small and disorganisedit takes some experience and a minute of common sense to realise how bad frigate holes are as i said they strip away control of accesssorry to hear about your unemployment it is a horrid over capitalistic society we are in these days with a continuing slinky recessioni dont put on a fake smile and slap people that i dont like on the back i will lose with my principles intact and speaking my mind without self censoring and conformingi was described once as a rugged individualist cest la vie shrugsfixed quoting isd ezwal
tell him it is schadenfreude all my pvpships i try and make them the first time before i fly them in the case of scimitars recenly i got the bpc and the bits then someone with the skills assembled it for meputs more value on the ship and the gamble of losing it is higher gives that little kick in eve that other mmos are missing
your ideas are bad and your understanding flawed i will most certainly not be voting for you in fact if there were a way to vote against you i would
do you have any figures on wh population and if its going up or down to back up this claim with the increase in blue loot they actually seem more active now than before hinting that wh population is increasing
20 seconds to align thats the base align of a covetorhull mining ship with a pilot mining solo with no navigation skills is that normal in null sec i guess thats a choice but id think anyone mining in dangerous space would train up the relevant skills at least have an alt cloaked up in space in order to get leadership bonuses including for agility and fit for a quicker align time oh and fit a higgs anchor rig in order to make mining while aligned more effective the align time sucks when you have to change celestials but when youre aligned you can definitely warp off before that sabre can lock you
you got my vote
this looks like a no win situation if you get elected it proves the system does work contrary to your premise and so the reform would not be needed if you are not elected then your premise may or may not be a fault but you will be unable to do anything about itwe have made the white paper a living document to allow for changes to be made year by year as the csm growschangesevolves so if elected you are welcome to try for election reform but as you said above you cannot walk in and push a button you will need the cooperation of other members of the csm and of ccp to effect any long lasting changespoliticians can lie well yes they can and probably do me i like twains thoughts on truth
its a slim chance but there are times in a rigged supposedlyrepresentative system in which the majority may briefly come to agree on a point of contention and use the broken voting system for an act of upheavalwhile i disagree with xenuria on there being said problem in place i believe she has the right to fight behind such a reform movement i see no harm coming from it as even in the case that it is successful it is most likely only representative of a deeper dissatisfaction in the voters over how the system works even if these voters are misguided as to the specifics of what is wrong with the system they still help to reveal the discontent
just face it dude no one wants you or your ignorance or banter on the csm want to find all the podcasts around eve online visit
do you have anything constructive to add to the discussion
hi tisiphone thank you for taking time to comment in my thread as i said in my opening post the holiday season is always hectic but i have been keeping up with my threadthank you for the invitation
you have my votei dont fly much in wh or anything like that but i know you have worked hard for the wh community and for the community as a whole and i respect that yesterdays weirdness is tomorrows reason why hunter s thompson

1keep mike on the job improving the game
i will be voting for you i have seen the work you have put in heard other csm members talk about your hard work i like that and i believe you will continue to work hard for usyesterdays weirdness is tomorrows reason why hunter s thompson
im glad to see youre running again ive been impressed with the work youve been doing so far especially the communication with the community at largeyou absolutely have my vote
csmx interview
what is you opinion about ccp giving you less then 24 hours as a csm member to respond on big game changing matters like losec doomsdayssource
i do not like it i acknowledge when communication lapses like this happen i then do my best to deal with the situation to quote myself from my weekly csm9 update on october 5th 2014ideally iUFFFDd like some time to think i may have an immediate reaction but some things crop up after pondering the topic with something like doomsdays it is hard to gather player reaction and feedback before it becomes public for this particular topic i needed to sit down with experienced pilots who know the mechanics of doomsdays and ideally people who were around when doomsdays could be used before that made the 24 hour notice for this mechanic useful i was able to go to the public and ask for feedback and work on it at the end of the day iUFFFDd prefer to have more advanced warning always
you have my retweetseriously good luck youll be on my ballot
are you going to betray all of us like you did to doomalso from reading your op it sounds like your main focus on csm is to add ingame mechanics that enable more npsi content why take something which main selling is you dont have to leave your corp or join ours to roam and then add in all this functionality that basically makes it another corpduring the time i worked with you your leadership decisions were questionable you have a long line of people who have worked with you in the past claiming youve shorted them andor straight up betrayed them and from my point of view your fcleadership decisions have been driven by passion and rash impulse rather than spending a lot of time and thought on them will we see this behavior reflect during your presumed term on the csmdo we really need more official subgroups in eve apart from corpalliancemilitia a few years ago there was a short clamour for implementation for a coalition mechanic in eve doesnt this mentality just encourage redundant feature creep for npsi fleets do we really need anything more than another fleet finder filter called public because what are corpssigswhatevers apart from a shared chat channel and mailing listthis past csm weve seen chairs filled by members who contributed nothing to the pressing matters at hand and served to promote their own interests which is technically all the csm is if ccp isnt going to pay attention to what you have to say because they dont deem it a pressing matter they wont then why waste a chair seat on itccp has given you the tools you need and told you how to use them chat channels and mailing lists we dont a csm member just to tell ccp that we should have a spectre fleet logo on killmailstheres no use crying after every mistake you just keep on trying til you run out of cake
assuming that was a serious question no in game politics and personas have no place on csm  a la gorski car acting like an idiot or mynnna acting only in the interest of the cfc instead of serving the playerbase as a wholeedit you edited your post while i was midresponse ill answer the new stuff that you added in a separate response
good question first the mechanics that i referred to are not limited to npsi communities but would be useful to a large number of groups from all over new eden for example the mechanics that are being discussed regarding fleet adverts would certainly help the npsi communities but would also help anyone who interacted with the fleet mechanic  that is the majority of eveim normally a very analytical person and when i dont know something or when i realize ive made an error im usually the first to admit to it as for my leadership style and the betrayal of people ive worked with in the past thats a different story entirely in my experience its often the people who feel they are owed something such as the loyalty of others who feel the most betrayed when something goes wrong for example as a ceo of a corporation i feel responsible to my people first and foremost and when they stop enjoying the game for whatever reason it is my job to rectify that as soon as possible and in whatever way possible structures friendships legacies they can all be rebuilt  but we play this game first and foremost to have fun and if were not having fun why are we playingeven a public fleet finder would be a useful and simple addition to current mechanics and yet it has still not been implemented as for the coalition mechanics and feature creep these entities already exist in game just not in an official capacity coalitions will exist regardless of a mechanic officially supporting it as with the communities that currently exist exist regardless of the amount of tools ccp has made available viewing it strictly from the quality of life perspective if the vast majority of the playerbase is already playing the game in this manner why would ccp not add the functionality with these sorts of tools you would not only make the existing groups stronger but promote new and more diverse groups in the futurewhat are corps other than shared chat channels and mailing lists shared standings calendars fleet adverts contracts roles kill logs history titles the list is endless corporations also allow for the ownership of structures and declarations of war  features which should not be granted to a corp lite model this is where the distinction is made  eve doesnt even have a friends list and yet is billed as a social and community based game want to be friends with someone in game who isnt in your corporation interact with them good luck anyone who has participated in a non corporation based group is well aware of just what is missing and what minor changes could drastically increase a members quality of lifethis is where i get to empirically say that youre wrong this is a priority for ccp whether you like it or not this was made clear in both the fanfest keynote speech as well as the update to the development roadmap during the eve vegas keynote speech the details are in the op if youre interested that being said im well aware that there will be more involved with the csm than solely this topic this is simply the facet a ccps roadmap where i consider myself a subject matter expertthis is no different than steve being an sme in 3rd party development manny a sme in sovereignty warfare mike azariah a sme for highsec or corebloodbrothers is a sme on the nrds playstyle even when those topics are not at hand those individuals can and still do contribute to the discussion  as will i my knowledge and experiences in eve are certainly focused in this area of the game but certainly not limited by them
except you have not yet referred to any mechanics specifically apart from that there is a substantial list of them in fact the only solid mechanic you have named that you would support is one that i brought up what other mechanics do you propose that would help these informal organizations feel more cohesive additionally of the ones you named nullsec sigs highsec incursion groups roleplayers and lore aficionados gankers and antigankers podcasters traders bloggers and npsi communities i can only see three perhaps four that would get any use out of these yet unnamed mechanics you propose and only maybe 1 your npsi can make a passable argument for spending any sort of development time into improvingso tldr how would these corporationinterfacestyle mechanics help bloggers roleplayers podcasters what precisely would you propose we add ccps financial reports have looked grim recently though the new trailer and expansions have added a wealth of new players and subs do you think ccp is going to invest the developer time and money into making these ideas into reality when its not something that is very marketable to new subscribers or returning playersif elected you will owe your constituents the full devotion of the time you can afford to commit to the game towards forwarding the platform you ran on even if other csm members disagree with you or ccp says no to something you cant just pout out and quit on the people that elected you being on the csm is probably not going to be very fun it entails playing nicely with other people you might not like or agree with as far as whether or not you can do this all we have to go on is your track record in game which is not stellarmuch like coalitions these groups like npsi fleets and sigs already exist and are strong in the game asis they certainly dont need mechanics to exist or be popular as we can see from various gankedspectrebombers bar fleets what i want to know is what exactly do you propose should be added why is it necessary and is it feasible for ccp to invest into making it happen when they are already faced with the issues of making real corporations and alliances work none of which you have given a tangible answer totheres no use crying after every mistake you just keep on trying til you run out of cake
npsi groups have no need of standings if you want to share a standings list chat channel and mailing list with somebody and youre in an npc corp ccp has already given you the tools for this its called joining a corpincidentally ccp has state
the references to find this information was located in the op but ill recreate it here group calendars group fitting list group bulletins group contracts group logo fleet to fleet standings fleet standings fleet kill history fleet adverts disconnecting while in fleet active members list official channel listing channel history channel roles and modes mailing list roles mailing list population cap mailing list links as you said not all of these will benefit communities or social groups that do not work around the fleet mechanic even so the amount of people who fleeting up with one another outside the boundaries of the corporation mechanic is astonishing and more than most people realize in spectre fleet alone there are 4000 people registered on the mailing list the maximum allowed last saturday during our golden fleet event with rvb ganked over 700 people joined our npsi fleet we are but one of five major npsi communities in eve not to mention the major russian and german npsi communitieswhat about incursion channels the valhalla project the ditanian fleet warp to me and incursion shiny network all run on the same principals of our pvp npsi communities for their pve npsi content in highsec they do this because the corporation mechanic is not only useless to them but detracts from their desired way to play the game these organizations are more active more capable more social than a lot of organization that use the corporate mechanics do these people not deserve a voice youre simply insane if you think that these entities are undeserving of any development timemoving onto nonfleet based communities and how their qol could be improved streaming communities such as sirsqueebles and everadio currently have nothing but links to oog browsers and websites in order to deliver their content or host their communities twitch broadcast integration already exists why not watch eve streamers in client why not be able to listen to everadio in game lore aficionados have their arekjaalan mailing list and would benefit from these changes as well as being able to collaborate on deciphering the mysteries of in game events such as carolines staroh and how would antigankers benefit from these changes this is my favorite one to answerthis blog post from minerbumpingcom describes the hostile takeover of the antiganking channel for those who arent experienced with running a group that bases out of a channel you might be surprised that the only role you can give someone is operator which is equivalent to a full director any operator has the exact same roles as the channel founder there is no other option unfortunately for the owners of antiganking an operator went rogue and completely nuked the channel if you want to know the full story read the blog postto put this in perspective as the ceo or a corporation you would have to give a member full director roles even if you wanted the only to do something trivial like send a mail or make a bookmark tell me that isnt completely insane a few bad apples in every bundle just because you dont like me doesnt mean that im incapable of forming friendships or profession working relationship with other people as a leader its impossible to make everyone happy and youll always get along with some better than others this is true whether spoken in the context of a corporation a community or a councildotlan is a popular and powerful tool that already exists should this stop ccp from updating the ingame map no dont be ridiculous same goes for literally any other third party tool fleetup carebearium siggy pyfa plh etc etc id like to make it clear that my ideas and proposals are not separate from a corporation and alliance redesign but a part of it however its my belief that even rework the corporation mechanics from the ground up will fail to include all of the needs and wants of the playerbase to facilitate how they play the game i am equally excited to contribute to corporation reform and whatever else that leads to
speak for yourselfi get it you dont play npsi and you never have you arent involved in any of these communities and as such the eve you play is vastly different from the one that myself and thousands of others play im not going to be pedantic regarding each and every point that you feel like we can do fine enough withoutregarding third party tools well simply have to agree to disagree and i agree with this direction npsi communities already serve as the catalyst that many people need to convert from pve to pvp we draw from all over eve established pirate corporations weekend warriors playing with friends incursion runner looking for a change of pace  even mike azariah participates in pvp through organizations such as spectre fleet these communities are not a hinderance in anyway to players getting involved in a corporation if anything they are the gateway one and the same youll also noticed i referenced material from currently sitting csm members who view this in the same light as i do and are either proposing ideas themselves or looking for feedback on possible mechanicsthats neither my job nor my choice there are many ways of implementing this that would achieve the desired result i dont get to direct the entire development process and its extremely likely this process is already underway if elected to the csm it would be my focus to ensure that no matter what version of the redesign ccp has chosen to pursue it would be beneficial for everyone of where they live in new eden or what they do
1 for opherding a npsi fleet to consistent success has to be good training for working with ccp on the csm
supporting the chief 
ahh jayne the entertainment train that never stops you know you should be worried if lex and i agree on anythingso a few points which i doubt youll answer but should nonetheless be presented here1 you have a long long history of scamming drama mongering and outright lying to people in eve which you were suppose to work with im not talking about some dinky little unknown corp where you awoxed a member and then kicked some inactives you actually went out of your way to falsify information and attempt to incriminate others for your twisted obsessive plot youve even recently stolen billions in assets from the alliance known as overload everything whos 2ic doom you were seen only a few months ago having beers with in person you even failed to grab a position in the last csm election according to some because of your crooked methods now your answer to that is this is just a game that much is true but if flying npsi suddenly makes you the posterboy for the movement and gives you the credentials to run a csm campaign on that platform what does all the lying and drama mongering say about you as a candidate at the end of the day yes scamming is part of eve but when it comes to running an organized and potent csm team is that what the players of eve need why does playing eve the way that you do give you credentials for the csm in one instance but is only regarded as just a game when it doesnt suit you2 your big selling point is that you created spectre fleet and that your experience in running public fleets gives you the credentials to be a csm yet even spectre fleet was created by drama mongering in bombers bar awoxing the main fc tempelman n something which you lied about we can say this is excusable but what is really concerning is that you contradict your own position on a very basic premise npsi is suppose to not be about corps yet this internal mail where you allow your members to refer to you as a certain dictator of the third reich a title which you seem to adore clearly shows an elitist attitude where spectre fleet is simply an extension of your corp to use and to wield for whatever whims you may have sash has been referred to as more of a cult than a corp how do you answer these criticisms3 last election year you were listed as a candidate on the official cfc ballot even with the cfcs backing you failed to take a position on the csm but my question is how can you talk yourself up as a person of the npsi community when you seem to be sitting in the same corner with one of the major nullsec blocs what assurances do we have as the voter4 lastly none of your suggestions really bring anything to the game everything you described pretty much already exists within the corp model or has out of game alternatives the elements you want to take from the corp model and applying it the npsi community already has viable alternatives your ideas are not fully thought out or developed and your platform is a mile wide but only an inch deep unfortunately your bid for the csm seems to be more about yourself rather than the people you supposedly wish to represent and that this position like spectre fleet will simply be used to further your position in game with your history of drama mongering dishonesty and could we say right narcissism  why would anyone vote for you not only would a csm seat be out right wasted your history of sabotaging attempted or other wise your partners your presence may actually be a detriment to the process all together

i started my eve career like most mining and doing missions and learning the game via the starter npc corp i was recruited by anger kidd of aegis requiem and the wonderful world of corp dynamics was opened up to me and i fell in love with game once more learning how to pvp within my new corp left me hungry to learn more and to become an fc myself after a friend recommended i join bombers bar i was now initiated into npsi fleets i never turned back i met jayne and flew with him several times while in bb it wasnt until the fall of bb and subsequent rise of a new npsi community spectre fleet that i truly got to know jayne as a community leader and a fc jayne fillons passionate commitment to the npsi community shows in every event he hosts as well as his commitment outside of the game his talk at last years eve vegas outlined not only his commitment but where he sees this community growing and with growth comes a need for voicethat voice is jayne fillon jayne fillon for csmx
hi seraph thanks for helping me win a beti promised myself that when you eventually came around id respond to you once and only once so here we goyoure comparing apples to oranges to here and it just doesnt make sense scamming metagaming and espionage are all parts of eve parts of eve that are not only supported through the existing mechanics but supported by the developers themselves ive engaged in these activities previously and im not ashamed by that nor do i think it diminishes of my other accomplishments put a different way what i do in game has no affect on my compulsions in real life when in a professional setting this much should be obvious as its been said countless time before welcome to eveyes i had beers with doom in vegas along with a lot of other wonderful people i greatly enjoyed my first player gathering and will certainly be attending again in the future regardless of our interactions in game or how they eventually ended up i wasnt trying to buddybuddy him while in vegas with a malicious intent to deceive thats ridiculous even if i met you at one of these gatherings god forbid i would pay you the respect you deserve and treat you like a normal human being instead of an internet villaini fail to see why this is a difficult conceptyoure grasping at straws and pulling cheapshots now none of which are even remotely relevant to the csm but i guess ill answer them anyway first just like the efforts of agony empire rvb tuskers vengance inc stille gewalt furtherance et al npsi communities have been formed and managed by corporations since the very beginning sash started spectre fleet and for a long time the only fcs in spectre fleet were the fcs from my corporation that is no longer the case but thats how we had to do it to get things started as for ownership of the community at the end of the day i own the channel the mailing lists the teamspeak server website i own everything because someone has to if you find some other way of running an npsi community please let me know otherwise ill simply let the results of my methods speak for themselvesmy title is a reference to the hyperbolic statement literally hitler and its a joke get over yourselfi have literally never heard about our corporation being called more of a corp than a cult so im just going to assume you made that up internally we have a joke that sash is an elitist social club which originated during the early days of our corporation when we did nothing but run with spectre fleet the members of my corporation were so focused on building up spectre fleet to be a successful community that we didnt do anything together as a corp at allthankfully those days are over and we can fly together as a corp more often now not sure what else youre looking for herethis sounds like a regurgitation of gevlon goblins election analysis i was far from the only noncfc member listed on the official cfc ballot most notably ali aras was prominently included to say that i failed even with the cfcs backing is a bit presumptuous i was quite low on the cfc official ballot last year and was eliminated before any of those votes trickled down i have never been in any cfc affiliated alliances or any nullbloc for that matter i was included on the official ballot for other reasons reasons that i would like to think included my writings and technical knowledge of eve which has been showcased in my various articles on themittanicom everyone is entitled to their own opinion  and im sure that those who agree with me instead of you will show it with their voteokay now that that is finally over with let me reiterate even if you respond which im sure you will i will not be humouring you with any more answers in this thread bar none you tried desperately last year to derail my csm campaign thread and succeeding in getting it locked forcing me to recreate it you tried to get me banned from the game by posting articles on en24 and your posts here are nothing but a continuation of your obsessive vendetta against mei look forward to your next article on en24it wont stop me

suzy just so you know i grabbed the above postquotehey rock on i really like the idea of balancing the cloaking mechanics so any exposure on the issue is a good thing
there were two issues not working on spaceships macrotransactions 70 monocle with discussion of paytowinthey blurred together into one storm of childish rage we call the summer of rage ccp just basically murdered everything worth doing because of it because they werent able to discern the issues in question from their planspaytowin was never actually on the table a hypothetical opinion piece in an opposing viewpoints setting in an internal newsletter only intended for employees was the only source that that might be a thing its ridiculous to believe it was going to happen because it wasntthe reality is though ccp needs to work less on spaceships spaceships are the best working part of their franchise and also the least important this is a political game more than anything else and the social components are the rot that is going to kill it walking in stations corp management etc is what needs love and attentionalso ccp is leaving money on the table by not doing wis in addition to the fact that the game would attract many more players with wis theres a valuable microtransaction market in customizing your quarters buying different furniture or such theres a lot of useless hangar items we already have like ship models books etc which could also be displayed in our captains quarters if we have them
four actually 3 their development model was unbelievably wasteful among other things they had the art department do a full final mockup of cq for each design iteration id bet that the artists still have nightmares about that4 they completely forgot that they were designing a game no seriously i think its been pulled down but there was a promotional video from ccp talking about their investment in virtual high fashion with carbon technology being used in displays in realworld designer stores and so on nothing to do with eve or for that matter wod when i say that our characters walk like runway models i mean it the animations are motioncaptured runway models intended to show off virtual fashion and while theres nothing intrinsically wrong with a broad range of options to make your character a distinct individual ideally the focus would still be on making them distinct individual characters within the game in ways that match the lore of the worldthe hilarious thing is that the monocle succeeded as designed theyve sold decently well and theyre used to convey conspicuous consumption exactly as they were meant to you dont have to pay realworld money of course but that still gets across that youre spacerich enough to blow a tremendous amount of isk on a cosmetic itemso basically ccp flubbed the execution badly except for the monocle ha if they go back to the original 2007ish vision for ambulation and if they apply the rapiddevelopment tools they now have and use them within their new development practices i believe they can do a much better job of it and without neglecting their game or traumatizing their art department this time will they signs point to not any time soon for one thing i think the eve 20 project is a much higher priority and i have to agree that that makes sense the more old creaky code is ripped out of the game and the more love the underlying engine gets the easier it will be for ccp to enlarge the game without getting ensnared in awful old legacy code and the more likely that theyll have the player base behind them when they decide to try it
honestly my personal feel is that if you talk eve 20 they should stop trying to fix the eve client ccps current other projects dust legion valkyrie etc use unreal engine which is an industry standard product thats easy to work with compatible with everything etc elite dangerous and star citizen are both planning to implement comprehensive scifi universes in a single game ccp should figure out how to consolidate its existing unreal properties in the future and use valkyrie as the starting point to developing a replacement for eve with a first person walking in stations viewpoint from the getgo and moving from small singleperson ships up to large multicrewed capital shipsbut i really dont think ccp will ever do that to be honest
everyone is anticipating the announcements that are due in the next couple of weeks even moreso the bulk of the residents of null are holding their breath before anything significant occurrs ie no real wars etc not only do we want to know how sov is going to change but we want those changes implemented as soon as possible dont worry about shaking up current null its already broken
ccp does not want to here this and keep on locking threads consiring this issu get this ccp stop the bumping plain and simple if you bump some one you sloud get aggression like any one els and or remove it all the same you want feed back from players we give you this every day for years now and still you do not here what we are telling you  it is a game expliod come bump my truck in rl and see what left of you car i promise you 10 000 eve players can vote yes on this and you will still not do it   keep it up thanx im not saying take it all out just review it  and plz dont make as you as ccp neva heard of is boxer we all know that how 2 guys gank with 15 toons and if that not a game expliot idk if you want proof go view you server logs you have no control over your game at this point vs pvp is boxers good job on that use that time to develop dust or some new eve game that we pay to make click below to lock thread as the truth always get wipe under the carpet

being a logi pilot i need very high navigation skills so it is actually worse than that for the average player to get into warp 4 and declining the loot is going up because there are more organised large alliances around the size of yours still doing really welli am talking about the 10 man corps that go into a c1 or c2 and hope to scratch out their future they cant keep out the scanning frigates and frig  destroyer swarms
from here
sorry but the base time to alignwarp in a covetorhull ship covetor or hulk with no skillsgang bonuses is 1913 seconds which means 20 seconds to actually warp away thats the worst time unless you are doing something like mining while running a mwd maybe you do something like that in high sec to avoid miner bumpers maybe when i mine i mine in low sec so i dont know what the latest meta in high sec belts isthen again shouldnt we be teaching miners to mine correctly using the higgs anchor rig not only is agility greatly increased but the align speed is under 30 msec which means its easier to mine while aligned
 the time to select the right thing from the overview or people  placesif i feel there is a high risk of threat then i will mine between 24 warp off points slow boating at 76 speed other than that i tank right up and my friends will jump on you u
for example it can take a sabre 17 seconds to get across 16 au in warp it takes 20 seconds for a miner to click on a location and get into warp if the pilots both react at the same speed to each other there is literally no hope for the minerguess what mining ship isnt suppose to stand up to a pvp ship you know what will give you equal footing your own pvp ship1your entire mentality reeks of themeparkesque notions terrible
seems you might want easier kills rather than good fights

not that you are expecting my vote but sadly i cannot vote for you your stated campaign platform is to dramatically change the csm to the point where many current csm members would not be elected unfortunately for you i like a lot of our current csm members
everything youve posted has been deflecting direct questions and attacking people who ask them ie nonconstructive things so why should anyone else have anyting constructive to add

the social corps are a choice just because you have less then 10 players doesnt automatically mean you have to be in a social corp want more profit and options then youve got to take more risk too just create a normal corp and setup a pos

both you and dj funkybacon got many votes from primarly the losec part of new eden plus the votes that trickle down through single transferable vote stvfrom funkys show and lack of updates on his blog site plus this controversy from a former top tier ccp devi get the feeling ccp games as a company is finding the csms opinion less valuableis this due to perhaps the csm 9 not speaking as a combined front like with the csm 8 or the lack of csm officers in the csm 9 or ccp reverting back to the bad old days 
i feel that my opinion is valuable i would not stand for a second election if i did noteach individual on the csm is responsible for their choices effort and the work they put into the position we are seen as individuals not as a single entity having officers did not decrease or increase anyones potential as a member i do not believe that ccp is reverting back to bad old days the new cycle is bringing new challenges the members of the csm must develop habits and behaviors to meet them they put out the energy make sure that the players are represented
thank you for your opinion you will get my losec vote
i dont think anyone deserves another seat in the csm as much as sugar kylei wanted to know your thoughts on combat boosters and if you had any ideas on how to improve them would you be willing to have ccp take another look at them or do you feel theyre mostly fine as they are
endie is my favorite writer and will be 1 on any ballot i see his name on
1 vote for jayne if we are in a cult then why dont all our backgrounds match oh wait can i have some free koolaid now you keep promising us
i think as we all saw from matiass run last year founding a thing that is successful does not necessarily grant you any credentials that makes you useful on the csm your ideas might be nice but as before stated they add very little to the actual game as far as the grand scheme of things is concerned you now have your own corp rallying around this thread blotting it out with worthless noise ive been a ceo longer than youve been playing this game and i wouldnt count this towards credentials to being a contributing csm membervov vote for jayne if you want another matias i suppose ccp will not care about the topics you bring to the table and you will contribute nothing to the discussions that others will bring to the table gl in your runtheres no use crying after every mistake you just keep on trying til you run out of cake
im interested to hear why you think ill be unable to contribute to any issues that arent explicitly listed in my platform
lex for csmx
jayne has been the best ceo and one of the best leader i have ever come across while playing eve he is passionate about the game and i truly believe he can lead almost anyone to success he is a fantastic fc a fantastic leader and a fantastic friend that i have had the pleasure to have for the past two years he will be number one on my ballot and would be so if i was in any other corporation he will be a positive impact on the csm
i support jayne for csm xas a bombers bar fc he was always fun to be around in sfas a fellow member of hades effect i trust him to make the right decisions
you can also read more about my campaign on the rvb forums no registration required
sion is a brilliant and dedicated advocate for the eve players a rational and thoughtful space diplomatpolitician and a generally good human being and if i dare say so someone i consider a friend his addition to csm9 was fantastic for us as regular eve players and hell be a tremendous asset to csm 10
as sion noted endie is running in my place this year i burned out pretty hard largely courtesy of real life
ive been in pretty close contact with jayne we were almost alliance mates there for a bit mangala and sugar over the last year and i think the world of all three of them and the work theyve put into the gamei love the idea of npsi groups they provide a very interesting gameplay approach to eve that is unique to eve and thats great the more tools ccp can provide to players to approach the game in their own way the better obviously ccp will always be behind the curve to some degree but thats understandableid definitely be in support of additional tools and organizational structures that npsi communities are interested in having though my personal feeling is that its of the utmost importance to iron out the traditional organizational structures first before turning attention to npsi organizations theyre niche and unique and require abnormal support from my understanding and due diligence needs to be done to ensure that they retain that unique niche aspectto your second point id also be highly interested in more granular corporations that arent as robust as full corporations with their own drawbacks and advantages id approach this topic with my general mentality what gameplay element does it provide what are its advantages what are its natural disadvantages what disadvantages should be leveraged against it to keep the riskreward scale balanced its an interesting time to be having discussions of this nature too as i imagine that the corporate and alliance rework is  if not close to completion  at least in its late design stages after which the momentum and leverage gained there may be applied to new ideas such as this having csm members who are aware and open to implementing engaging new mechanics like this is definitely going to be important in the near future

the monocles did sell well after 40 hours when ccp hilmars leaked email appeared on evenews24 it saidsource
you only say its too costly if you cant imagine all the paperpushing that needs to be done to make that war legal edit or youre one of the people who want to have the interaction of nullsecwspace no engagement rules applied to highsec indefinetly through the war mechanic which can only be sustained if the war costs are lowered or nullified
no hell nothe sovreignty mechanic needs to be put in with deliberation and flawless execution  which takes its toll on time not some botched up quick patch that would break things and bring out a bugfest of exploitable scenarios
absolutely this pushing for a quick fix to a problem this complex is how we ended up with this mess we have now this thread has degenerated to the point its become like two bald men fighting over a comb  doc fury
because ccp rushing features to meet deadlines has worked so well in the past
you understand why ccp went to a six week release cycle right because they tend to break things they rush to finish in time for releasealso we want a solution to the problem that is null sov not a halfassed rush job that will make ccp do even more work to fix what the players break
uhmm nothe csm needs to give input and feedback to proposed sov changes thats allthe csm does not need to champion when the changes go into effect the csm should not have and does not have control over the coding or quality control they cannot anticipate or deal with the bugs created within game itself or effect how many resources ccp devotes to the changes it would be like a child stomping his or her feet and demanding a new toy please lets be adults and await the changes patiently you can warm up your flame posts later
op lets give you a small history lesson of rushed sov mechanics shall wein 2004 ccp launched exodus which was the first the first time players could actually claim sov for some odd reason ccp decided to link pos to sov you needed more pos then anyone else and it gave you sov ccp in there brilliant wisdom never saw how stupid this idea was so started the pos spam wars if you have a system with 5 moons and my alliances placed 1 large tower and you came along and placed 4 small towers at dt that day i would lose sov to yoru 4 towerslater ccp resived this and created a weight system 1 small tower  1 point 1 medium  5 points and 1 large  7 points thus starts the era of spaming large towerslater ccp revised this yet again and made it so alliances can only deploy a max of 5 towers a day and sov would take effect in 7 daysshortly after this 0708 i forget ccp decided that if the above was not bad enoughm they would implement contalation sov which would lead to a stupider idea of regional sov never implemented thank gods essentually if you owned 51 of the systems in a constalation and 3 stations you could declare a station system yoru capitol and everthing in that system could not be attacked until the sov fell below 51 thus you had the skyrocketing rise of titans and suspers and the start of more meta gaming then spaming an established alliance like bob or goons was near impossible to remove without a crap load of effort worst idea ever still tied to pos was suppose to give us new tools but was left for oh shineythen in 2010 ccp finally got smart and untangled pos from sov sortof and created dominion sov this new fee based sov tied to structures not pos and the proliferation of titans and supers due to 3 years of every alliance making them with zero issues brought us to the new renter alliance system as no small alliance could compete without being steam rolledyea half assed ideas that once made took years to adjust and were left to fester no i think ccp can take all the time they need to do it right this time thank you very much
lets rush and create the next sim city launch or creed rouge prefectly flawless logic
ok have asked this before and i think it wont be a big problem to codeold thread
who would you actually borrow money from npcs or playersso i make a 30 day char borrow 3 billion with basically no collateral buy ships put them onto a courier contract of my other char for exceedingly low collateral i fail the shipment and steal it 30 day char goes bankrupt i keep ships in rough value of 25bil repeat the process hell i can keep creating chars and accounts all year long for that its like free ships
i would rip this system for all its worth then buy plex to set up another account to do it again
i would favor this but i would have one very strong conditionthe prior name and history of the character must be made available in the biography of the character it would be read only and not editable all standings would remain the same the employment history would also remain nothing other than the characters name would otherwise change the date the old name was assumed and the date of the change would also be notedyes if you apply to a corps they would see the old name it would be up to the owner to explain the change all other similar name changes would be noted in biography
their former name should show up in their character info like corp history
one element of eve that differs from most other popular mmos besides older stuff like uo and makes it stand out is that almost everything can be destroyed while this is mostly what makes eve great and refreshing at least for me this has some disadvantagesplayer corporations all this stuff with intel spies and disbanding of corporations makes a lot of players risk averse me included not to mention the disappointment and other negative effects the crushing of a flourishing corporationalliance has for its player and community around that corpalliance the current corporationalliance system is also much too rigid in my opinion because there are not enough tools or too complicated tools to handle as far as i can tell from what i read and seen myself in game these entities eg you cannot trade shares for a corporation just to mention a topic currently discussed somewhere around herefurther there is a slight asymmetry in how npc and player corporations play out you cannot work for a player corp you are only a member but at the same time you can work for several npc corps but cannot be member of most npc corps while this is actually not a problem this gave me the following ideasuggestionseparate player corporations from player groupscommunities transform what are now player corporations and alliances into something similar to what in most other mmos guilds clans whatever you like to call them are lets say groups and alliance several groups in one alliance to keep the twotiered system so alliance stays pretty much the samebut change player corporations so that you cannot be a member of that corp make them more like entities players can fight over in various ways corporations own assets like ships and stuff i would even go so far that only corporations can own larger assets like stations and capital ships so no privately owned titan and only authorised players individuals groups or alliances per access controls can get access to these assets in varying degreefurther only corporations can own space sovereign nullcorporations can have possibly different modes of administration how many people are in charge of administrating which corp assets in case the corp is not privately owned shares can be sold on the market possibly offer different types business models suitable for different sizes and operations of corps a highsec mining corp wont need much assets besides corpowned orcas and therefore not much to administrate a null sov holding corp with cap fleets and stuff will need much more administrative toolsthis will open many more possibilities for content creation your player group can try to buy out certain corporations via the shares or take it over by force or add even other possibilities drive them off the market so that the corp goes bankrupt etc set up goals for a corporation let shareholders vote for what the corp should do to make profit if it is a forprofit corp let the shareholders receive dividends etc since by destroying a corp you no longer also destroy a player community i imagine there can be much more flux in the corporations landscape space and assets can more easily change hands because there could be several different methods how corp assets and corps themselves switch owners trading caps can be easier etcas a player group you would no longer own space directly as it is now you would have interest in corporations your group has founded or taken over that could own space the threat of spies is somewhat reduced to a level where it is not something that can destroy a whole community but still remain as an option to steal assets und thus is more incorporated into the gameplayplease discuss
a good fight is subjective what you want is to be able to hide your industrial ships because you believe that the war ships and indy ships should never interact
incorrect there would be more at stake and you can bet that the ball will be dropped more than once a tool is only as good as those using it
your op example denotes that you feel industrial ships are too easily killed by attackers defenders already have the majority of advantages local as an intel rule you have infrastructure to reship you have your own allies what exactly is the issue
cloaked ship has the intel from that they can plan and launch an attack at their leisure that wipes out the defenders or move on to a softer target
i asked what the issue is you respond with cloaked ships having intel and that they can launch their attack when they choose or move on why is that an issue
majority of advantage
how about this you list and number all the advantages the attacker has and ill list the advantages the defender has go

crap answers and this game isnt divided between attacker and defender everyone has the same limitations and everyone is an attacker or defender none of your criticisms are viable toward the current method and i doubt anyone except renters or carebears would feel the same
we have a difference of opinion and i feel you are blind to my perspective we wont resolve this have a good time o7
i totally agree the mechanic need to be changed in some way cloaky reds sitting all day playing with their dicks go against ccps who new direction of meaningful game play being able to sit afk for hours and have an impact in game is counter productive to the whole new direction me points to iso boxer
and they are whiners too with bulls sense of honourwhy not make it so that there is a better chance of people suvivingwhats the sport in a cloaked bomber with cyno who sits in your system for 3 weeks and randomly warps to you and blops 12 sins on your butt those goatpeople even have the crass to say gffix eve
it depends what you mean if you mean hot droppers that use afk cloak alts then i agreeif you mean guys that use throw away alts in throw away ships then i agreehowever there are pirates that are really great those guys that go in and rob sites of their salvage or random ships for a song those guys that use their main character with real ships and hunt in low sec the guys that pick out a particular person find them corner them and blow them up there are pirates that play like the bounty system actually works and they do it successfully for the profit of the loot that dropsi can respect people that play with the mechanics the way they were intended to work and dont exploit the weaknesses
would you be for removing cloaked ships from local the issue i often hear is that an afk cloaky person stops people from doing anything in a system if they vanished from local that effect would stop if they attacked they wouldnt be afk and is legitimate gameplay what are your thoughts
as said previously the idea i support is sov structures and force recon hunterscloakers could still operate they would just have to do it actively
vague answer that didnt address the specifics of my questions unfortunately
thanks for making my point bro o7
wait are you serious about that mining thinga slot game for miners whatall other ideas are great but i honestly cant believe the slot game thing is no trolledit a minigame for miners would be great indeed but not as luck based as a slot machine that would  economy
would i ever troll anyone 
never everyou da untrollest
1 hideout idea seems nifty something along the lines of the mobile siphon unit which adds more dynamics to the game2a your afk while in space is unfortunately terrible as a cov ops pilot im often stuck in space not only for hours but days and weeks at a time i dont have the luxury of docking up because my station is many jumps away especially now that im hitting more wormholes than before i need to be able to go afk while in space because the alternative is turning the game off for me you dont want me to do that now do you 2b your ore idea hits along a similar idea i had but i dont think randomization is the best thing to do perhaps i just never had an interest in gambling but i think a mini game for maximum efficiency mining is much better say every 10 minutes you play the mini game and based on how well you do your mining efficiency can go up or down an active miner will be able to mine and profit way more than a passive miner but passive mining shouldnt be completely stopped either lets face it plenty of people have kids work obligations but still want to play the game even if at a limited level if the choice is between having an afk miner that has to take care of the baby vs no player at all what would you choose3 no way on the wardecs people can just make single person corps and hide in them forever4 agreed on people not being able to stay in an npc corp forever5 not sure how i feel about dreads im worried this would allow a big 00 bloc to have more influence in highsec right now marauders sort of act like the dreads of hs and i think its an interesting niche to be developed upon rather than strangled in its sleep by putting dreads in hs6 as far as faction police goesthat should be a joinable faction like fw where you can police hs of criminals for lp throw the npc faction police outreplace with actual players7 keeping pirates out of hs stations may conflict with idea 6 but its a possibility
ive provided answers to the just for crits lowsec questionaire look for them on their website sometime soon
so long as you support the upcoming nerf to supers and carriers as a result of a alleged completely false exploit and are towing the line of of spreading bull  instead of the truth you have lost any credibility and reason that we should support you and as such i encourage others to vote you outsootsia
or you could try using evidence to convince her to change her mind instead of throwing a tantrum and making idiotic threats shocking i know but not everybody in eve thinks being a dumb ass drama queen is the way to get what they wantas for you sugar 1 vote from me as youve already shown yourself to be a decent and effective representative of the players
i cant believe i havent done this yetthere could literally be no better way to spend your vote than to vote for sugar kyle especially if you live in lowsec the most hardworking dedicated intelligent and enthusiastic csm member i have ever come across vote sugar kyle for csmx or have your head checked for brain damagenideneditorinchiefcrossing zebrasmoira corp  villore accords  gallente militia  lowlife on crossing zebras  nidengmva
i continually argue that if we have freedom without real consequences and people choose to be horrid to others it speaks volumes about their personality as it shows their natural uninhibited inclinations
it can be argued either way back and forth endlessly what cant be argued is that eve and real life are two completely different things just because i do something in game such as steal from another corporation doesnt mean that i have only by the grace of god been able to repress those same urges in real life in eve theft and espionage are not against the law they are a part of the game this is identical to how shooting people in call of duty is a part of that game and has absolutely bearing on your desires to shoot people in the face while walking down the streetin game i probably abide by different a code of ethics than you and thats fine  but just because you dont play by the same rules or like the way that i play my game doesnt make my playstyle immoral or invalid for example i dont agree with what code does by extorting highsec miners but that doesnt mean i dont support their freedom to play eve the way that they have chosen to play itthats the beauty of the sandbox
you dont need to repeat the same old tired line jayne we all know in game and out of game are two separate things the issue is a certain trend or tendency to basically just  up any organization you happen to be even remotely attached toin one instance you use your in game play style as a reason to get elected in the same breath you say that the way you play doesnt necessarily reflect you you cant have it both ways
my last post here because it is your thread some of us dont need to repress those urges in real life we dont have them in the first placehave a good day  night
not to be that guy but i have had people back stab me before steal the corp wallet and assets hurts more when its a friend not sure what it says about a persons morals when representing a group of people when actions seem to support that you are out for yourself using questionable moral tactics i respect the npsi fleets as i used to roam with noir and have worked with bombers bar back in my high sec days and i respect the work to create and grow spectre fleet despite messing with our timer in e reach i dont know that i could vote for you due to the corp theft thing as it would support a play style that is contrary to building a community as well as it not speaking specifically well about the choices you might maketldr scamming spying and corp theft are a part of the game but dont speak well about the person committing them
howthey are playstylesthis is a roleplaying game isnt itwe all play a role and all roles need to be filledsomeone has to be the bad guyjust because someone plays a role such as a thief or a pirate doesnt mean they in real life will act even remotely similar as a csm all that matters is what he will do out of game for us
in regards specifically to the background provided on jayne iUFFFDm really struggling to see how this would or could impact the csm itself am i right in thinking that there have been elected csm candidates in the past that have similar histories inside the game of deception and fraud within eve whove gone on to serve a successful term unhinderedif you donUFFFDt like this course heUFFFDs taken in game then itUFFFDs probably because itUFFFDs contrary to your own chosen path in eve which in that case vote for your own sceneUFFFDs prospective candidate instead or be insightful and note that heUFFFDs aware of the various different careers in eve and that he would look to support them in their own right alongside his own agenda an agenda which every candidate has also i get the impression that the information being brought about here is more of a reaction from those involved in said drama wanting to diminish jayneUFFFDs tin tin like character in other words theyUFFFDre still disappointed and want to defame not genuinely worried about any consequences his election may have on the csm or maybe youUFFFDre right to bring this about and itUFFFDs just me who canUFFFDt see how itUFFFDs relevant i mean what are the implications of this heUFFFDll break the nda and get kicked off start his own csm steal other council memberUFFFDs treats at the summits i just donUFFFDt get it other than he screwed us over in a sandbox game where itUFFFDs completely permissible and weUFFFDre still bitter lastly it would seem whether people from other avenues like it or not the npsi way of life in eve is now just as viable and as valid a route as any other play style in eve which means it needs a representative and i donUFFFDt see many other as well rounded and as doughy candidates as space hitler jayne for the cause i also had some other more relevant questions for jayne i scribbled down and then lost sorreh iUFFFDll get back to youtwitter  wwwtricksofthetradesnet
i cant really say your impression is correct for my own personal experience jayne had been a junior director in my corp a position he failed to fulfill and ended up using it as a drama mongering pulpit i had all but stopped playing the game due to some rl obligations so his actions were more of a turn off than any direct attack on me it was simply stupid obnoxious and all together pointlesslex arson and i are in agreement even though weve been quite adamant about attacking each other elsewhere are in agreement lex was another individual who was not a victim of jaynes drama mongering either but a witness and actually an ally for the time beinghe uses spectre fleet and the npsi community as his pedestal but even that was created and maintained by dishonest means he started spectre fleet specifically to replace bombers bar he hired mercenaries to attack bombers bar all the while claiming it had been other people he set up an awox on tempelman and when he quit he used that as an opportunity to advertise his personal channel hell he even tried to work with me to set it all up although i declined to be involved i mean his whole resume all his credentials everything is based off of some sort of drama mongering and dishonesty nothing is legitimate so what can he contribute if all his accomplishments are based on farces mynna or whatever other evil goon on the csm may have scammed or whatever but they have legitimate accomplishments and credentials that show yea they can actually contribute more than just that can jayne say the sameand even if that werent a problem he has no actual substance to make up for it with any sort of viable ideas any sort of criticism leveled toward him is part of some vendetta or conspiracy in his mind the guy cant even take a critique i doubt hes even writing his own replies hi ns he has an alt and his corp mates chiming in cheerleading and thats about as far as it will go
i literally watched this episode this morning 3
to help round out page three on a high note i was recently asked a lot of tough questions by marc scaurus of themittanicom and his newer project justforcritscom although the questionnaire focused on my opinions regarding lowsec there were a lot of other topic covered that would be of interest to those who wanted a more indepth look into my opinions in other areas of the gameyou can read the answered questionairre here
i actually really like this its a fairly solid platform and you may fare as a great replacement since mangala isnt running from what i heard will be watching so far 1
thanks for the folks at cap stable for the interview
do you honestly believe you as a csm member and null sec resident have the power to change ccp games mind to make the new sovereignty system occupancybased instead of the companys preferred no sov system with players fighting over objects like asteroid belts instead of over systems source
a great candidate for a great service
right youd like to represent every man woman and child in eve but forgot to mention youre part of the largest coalition in eve which has absolutely no effect on your viewpoints goals and endorsmentscan you reiterate for us tinfoilhat people what exactly youre bringing to the table that would drastically be better than the already veteran players on csm so far
well thats the thing i havent been endorsed by anyone as a large group im doing this on my own what i bring to the table is that im not the old bitter cynical vet ive been in wi for 3 mos and 6 days as of this writing to be honest cfc gsf even wi no one has really even acknowledged my running my time in null sec and my year or so of play sure does have an influence on my viewpoints as for endorsements i only have individuals my hope is that the community can see value to a new perspective i try to look at things as neutrally as possible i try to see things with the interest of balance and logic my personal view of the csm while yes they will have knowledge and passion for one aspect over another is there to take the voices of the community and relay that voice in a concise manner try to look at what people are saying and try to distill it down to its core or explore the whole issuean example would be an evemail i received today in regards to low sec mention was made to having pirates appear blinking red on overview by default that i feel is a small part of a larger quality of life issue lets not just address that lets look at the overview as a whole why are so many people installing aftermarket or 3rd party overview packs maybe maintain the customization but pull some of the immensely valuable aspects of some other overview packs into the game loaded defaultsimilar to incorporating some of the features and value of eft or pyfa into the in game fitting interfacecan i represent every single individual in eve alone absolutely not i dont think thats a realistic goal thats also why there are many representatives on the csm and not just onei would ask that no one underestimate the value of someone relatively new to the game that hasnt been necessarily hardened by it i am confident i can bring new and balanced perspective to the table from someone who loves it logs on every day and really wants to do everything they can to make eve even more awesome
afk cloaking is a necessity due to the way game mechanics currently work if i jump into your system while youre ratting you know what youll do go dock up instantly or call 200 of your goon buddies to come back you up thats completely legitimate you seek to minimize loss and defend your territory but why not allow me the possibility to challenge that status quowhat are your own credentials on this matter how many systems have you ransomed how many covert operations have you headed are you not merely a sheep trying to give your opinion about how wolves should hunt
as ive stated above i look to balance the mechanic as others have expressed interest as well as for challenging the status quo i think thats the whole objective of the new sov mechanics that are expected to come out clearly cloak camping isnt necessary to kill anyone ratting as plenty of ratters die every hour even ive been on both sides of this and i believe its a mechanic that should be looked at also stated previously in threadedit also notice my partnership in running with wingspantt basically a guy who spends 90 of his time cloaked in eve
you forgot to mention the old et game that atari made and then had to literally bury it was so bad another good example on why you dont rush game development
loans used to exist but there was no way to grantee any type of payback which was an issue now all of these banks or loaners or investments you see are 999999999 scamsnote needs more 9s past the decimal
the largest problem with in a game like eve is that theres no consequence on defaulting on the loan like in real life for example defaulting in real life means a black mark on your credit collections calls liens etc etcin eve you can laugh in peoples faces and walk away and theres no threat of repercussions this behavior is clear through courier contracts without sufficent collateral as failing the contract literally has no consequence
 this would really just be a bonus but under the the jump clones tab on the character sheet it would be nice with a counter that showed you how many jump clones you had used out of all the possible taking your skill in consideration dont know if im
so you are asking for a counter like soyou have 8 jump clones out of a possible 9is that about itdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
yea exactly
there is no point in answering the answer is there if you ask anyone in a wormhole you are wasting time asking questions that could be in a faq to newbies
there is no faq for your opinions which is the purpose of this thread being condescending doesnt exactly inspire constituents to vote for you either bit of political advice there
entertaining you is worse because you are argumentative with everyone on the forums however i am going to assume that you have never been in a worm hole and never lived in null to spell it all outin a worm hole when you notice a cloaky ship you hopefully pick them up on dscan to know what they are you will also probably see a worm hole entrance that has appeared because you havent existed your staticssmall corp  alliance 1030 peoplesee probes  get safeasks corp and alliance if they are scanningknow there is a hostile theresend out a scanner shipfind the new entrancesit on the entrance until they leave decloak when they exitdestabilise the worm holespend six hours figuring out if any other ships are in there while remaining cloaked and hiddenyou do not go out you do not engage because you dont know what you are fighting you do not want to get trapped outside the worm hole you do not want to waste valuable ships pilots or podsnull sec if cloaked ships disappear from localevery time they hit a gate they pop up in local when they decloakcloak ship comes in  get safewait for them to leavekeep waiting for them to leavethey logged off probably a trap keep waiting for them to leavewhen they hit gates and pop up in different systems then you might come outspend six hours figuring out if they have covert cynoed people into the systemprobably leave the system or log off and play another game for a few dayslast things consider doing engage themgo rattinggo miningtry bait them outthey probably know what you have they probably have more and if you feed them kills they keep coming back or they stay there day in and day out so the only tactics that work for worm hole and null defense is overwhelming force or kill denial
in the worst possible case maybe my old corps experience in wormhole life is that fighting outnumbered and often outshipped and still making a real fight out of an engagement and being good sports about it afterward earned us a lot of respect and a fair few larger alliesin the wormhole sense that theyll still attack us and expect us to do the same to them but theyll also invite us on roams answer batphones as would we and team up with us to attack someone larger its true that many of the corps we faced could have burned us completely out of our hole at any time but that just makes it more significant that none of them didim also reasonably sure that too much kill denial is the fastest way to get invaded
glad it worked out for youin most cases engaging everything loses you ships time and iskoh one main reason to not get burned out is those timers everyone hates having to leave someone there or a team to get them in when the tower goes out of rf and a team to stop the defenders emptying it before thentwo options there show cheap ships and look like too much trouble to melt the pos or show a lot of shiny things few carriers multiple poses
i have lived in null actually and im not argumentative im being a critic im challenging your position because i find it problematic and you should get used to this sort of thing because as a csm you will be challenged frequentlyim not sure about the rest of your comment you detail some situations and my reaction is so whats the problem
that is all
its also fun not always but often enough we flew relatively cheap mixed t1t2 and we had awesome space priests contrary to popular opinion you dont need to roll in shiny t3swe werent rich well except for the guys who were already rich going in but we didnt exactly have to bust our tails to recoup losses it was a pretty good runif it comes to that then yeah youre in trouble the closest we got was some guy in a stealth bomber winging torpedoes at our pos shields at some bizarre hour because he was drunk or bored or something i will not dispute that poses need a wholesale goingover and i look forward to the corporation overhaul

2a i do expect you to log off or accept pressing a button every x minutes 2030 or so if you stay on the same grid 2b that would work too i just want less afk mining you can do this by punishment or rewarding players lets try rewarding for a change3 they can already be in npc corps and hide for ever there is no difference might want those npc corps to still pay tax 5 true that is a risk6 sounds fun too there are many ways to get to the same destination7 i dont want them out of hs stations
then people in stationpos should get ejected out into space if they dont push a button every 2030 min as well no
no if youre docked you dont gain anything afk mining afk cloaked in enemy system etc you do have an advantage so you have to work for it and like i said before even if you just move once every 2030 minutes you will not see anything popup as you re active
you realise that an afk miner is just afk after 2030 minutes right being afk doesnt mystically cause your ore hold to empty itself in a station
its not perfect and needs work but i am looking for something to minimize afk cloaking and mining any ideas are welcome
great that you pointed that out lucasbut still  toras idea about making mining more active is goodyou could even let those miners have their own choice  if they want to afk mine theyll not make as much profit as someone who plays the minigame
oh dont get me wrong mining should be more active but afk timer are completely irrelevant since if you are actually mining youre not afk and minigames are generlally a bad idea they tend to put people off the mechanics themselves need to be more active not just here play are arbitrary minigame to complete your unrelated task because we cant be bothered to improve your gameplayall in all though toras campaign reads like make it painful and annoying to play most of the game except wardecs which should be easier
care to explain how increased dec fees and social corps make war decs easier  what would you do to improve it 
wardec fees are a token change the problem with wardecs is the mechanics are meaningless its just a way to turn off concord making it more expensive just for the lowest group doesnt fix the mechanics and to groups like yours would make very little difference all that does is mean that a small group wardeccing another small group the times when the wardec mechanics are arguably working best because they are actually fighting for a reason rather than killboard padding has to pay twice as muchid personally go the other way id keep it cheap to wardec the first few groups then it would exponentially grow so once you read 15 or so wardecs it becomes ridiculously expensive and 20 or so would be financially unachievable wardecs should happen in far fewer numbers for real reasons not just so you can switch off concord for the maximum number of targets you should need to have to make a choice do i wardec these guys or these guys not ill just wardec everyone wardecs need to be given more reason they should be more than just a concord off switch they should promote interaction between groups who have a reason to fight each other that isnt just the killboard like fighting with a competitor for exampleeffectively what youre doing is saying ill sacrifice this really tiny change and you sacrifice this massive change and acting like its a fair tradeoffas for social corps they are just a way to make up for the real change which is shutting npc corps to older players lets look past the fact that to force someone out of an npc corp what really would have to happen is they get dumped in a 1 man corp and look at the lack of benefit if a social corp is just effectively an npc corp why move them out of an npc corp at all npc corps already have a much more interesting corp chat than most other corps and keep everyone on the same level all a social corp would do is force you into the same situation but with the added restrictions of having to be either alone a leader of a corp or overseen by someone else not to mention that you suggest they would be restricted to 10 players so youd only be able to be social with a very small group of people and growing bigger would mean turning on wardecs something npc players have no interest in doing
so youre saying my suggestions make it harder not easier  marmite has 100 wars per week lets assume they are all small corps that would mean i pay 100 x 50m  5b isks per week more would that make me war dec less corps i would think so so youre saying it should be almost impossible for any large mercenary alliance to have more then 20 contracts  and fun wars should all be removed  if people are willing to pay for something why wouldnt you allow it  if a large nullsec alliance is wiling to pay for srp youre saying they cant because it costs to much  isnt that their choice  did the fact you are at war with us for over a year now influence your opinion on this matter  mercenary alliances go to war for profit just as nullsec alliances take sov for profit are you saying profit is bad and nullsec alliances shouldnt have more then 20 systems or it will get extreemly expensive to hold them i agree npc corp chats are good for new players because its a great place to find out how things in eve work but the next step up to a corp is to big in my opinion as in most cases they do not get the time to settle down a social corp could be that in between phase
but in comparison to what you earn and how much you already pay it would be a drop in the ocean especially since mercenary corps tend to have many fees paid for by the client for a small corp deccing another small corp it would be prohibitiveyes large mercenary corps should need to make a choice between the contracts they take or split themselves down to cover more contracts if thats what they wish to do the current system of im going to wardec everyone because i can is not a good design you can simply add wardecs for smaller groups until the end of time knowing that they stand no chance of retaliating id rather you had to make a choice do i take this contract or that contract can i split down into smaller entities to cover both would splitting down put too much strain on our members covering the existing contractsand no the fact that you are at war with my alliance if you still are i dont actually check is irrelevant even if they did change the wardecs the way i suggest id still expect to be one of the wardecs you choose to go through with as we provide plenty of easy targetsyes sov should be restricted which is why youll find most null players in support of occupancy based sov if you cant use it youll lose itexcept it would just be a boring npc corp the jump to a player corp would be just as big youre still saying stay safe in this corp or open yourself up to wardecs on that one if they existed i guaranteed that the vast majority of long term npc players would just be them and their alts in thousands of social corps arguably making the game less social
we pay around 1012b in war dec fees a week 5b would be about 40 more cost i would say thats a lot for an alliance who doesnUFFFDt have the luxury of moon goo afk ratting etc do you think its ok if we would increase your trading taxes with 40  probably not but still i want this change for war decs even if it will be hard on my own alliance so would that make me bad in your opinion or an eve hero is it bad design if any big nullsec alliance would send in huge fleets to highsec to come after us  is that fair to an alliance as marmites which is only 170 member  are you saying nullsec alliance should have a max number of players to keep things fair  or do we just accept that the game you willingly started playing isnUFFFDt always fair and could be evil  keep eve fun and dont nerf it to deathcan you show me your source of UFFFDyes sov should be restricted which is why youll find most null players in support of occupancy based sov if you cant use it youll lose itUFFFD  i see you often talk for large groups in eve but i keep missing your sources that they really agree with yousocial corps shouldnUFFFDt be boring as you can grow your corp to about 10 players i can have a lot of fun with 10 players in eve your view on eve players being less social in small corps worries me
its still a nothing change 40 on my taxes would still be nothing id happily accept double that in comparison to how much i make taxes are tiny they are 075 of a sale with brokers fees being a further 04 or so so even doubling both would only be 23 tax which would simply get passed on to the buyer the same way that much your additional fees would simply get passed on to the customerthat could happen under any system if a larger group chooses to fight back thats what can happen youre going off on a tangent here the thing is you find it fun because youre the large group bullying the little groups with your superior power i dont think that making you have to choose between who you attack rather than just attacking everyone is a bad thing you should have to make choicesthe null sec statement on occupancy based sov is on such source its really not hard to find people on board with the idea of shrinking down null groups areas of controlim sure yo udo have fun with 10 players but thats 10 players out of a larger group someone in an npc corp finding a group of 10 people he enjoys playing with and who are all online together is highly unlikely to happen beyond it being difficult to find those people most wouldnt even try since theres still no benefit to being in a corp with other players effectively the same change could be made by simply removing npc corp chat since thats pretty much what a social corp would be an npc corp without thousands of other playersand of course they would be less social why would someone who is currently in an npc corp choose to put themselves in a group with other players when they gain no benefit from doing so people wont just flock to join other social corps simply because they are available thats why its not a very well thought out idea
then let me rephrase that would you think its acceptable to have a 40 less profit  of course you wouldnUFFFDt and are you saying itUFFFDs ok for our clients to pay for these losses  if so never start a business i personally donUFFFDt think its acceptableisnUFFFDt that exactly what large nullsec alliances do to smaller alliance when they take over their sov  you still havenUFFFDt answered the question what the difference is between us and corps we war dec and big nullsec alliances who go after smaller alliance i see no difference here itUFFFDs all part of the food chain exactly the reason i think social corps can be useful start a small social corp and continue to grow it to a basic corp or even bigger i really hope you are trolling me here
if i had 40 less profit yes id pass at least the majority of that to the customer and yes thats fine thats how business work in the real world at the end of the day you do things for the profit you feel is acceptable if costs go up often so does the price this is why crude oil prices affect the prices of petrol are you saying that someone that pays you 100m for a 50m wardec now would not pay any extra if the wardec cost 100mexcept youre buying out concord for hundreds of corps for very little isk i get that you think its fine to do that but surely you can appreciate how your targets find that to be considerably less than fine being a csm member isnt about just pushing what benefits you no there is no reason for someone in an npc corp to put themselves under someone elses leadership when all they want to do is mine mission and be left alone you seem to think that if they made social corps and kicked people into them that they would suddenly want to be more social even though theres no benefit to doing so thats just not how it works you not understanding that is yet another reason why youd be an awful csm member
this is probably the 100th time you keep accusing me i benefit from these changes and we keep seeing facts its actually the opposite i am going to end this now and tell myself we just have different views on facts and being social
im sure it is and for the 100th time people can clearly see that yout chances are token changes to make it appear like you are losing out along with everyone else the realism is that you want massive changes to nerf other peoples playstyles and small insignificant changes to your own in in some ways direct benefits like the ability to run dreadnaughts in highsec to make it easier for you to pos bash small industry corps im certainly not the only one who has noticed thisyour inability to understand this and even to understand the basic reasons why people play in ways different to your own is at the core of why you are a terrible csm candidate
i think the only terrible approach displayed here by tora was trying to intelligently have any kind of discourse with lucas kell in the first placelike anslo veers belvar and other forum trolls the only response should beshut up lucasf
my focus will still be on highsec but why not talk about lowsec
oh i see so he thinks that npc corp players will suddenly be social if they make some corps that they call social corps and that making it twice as hard for smaller corps to start wardecs with each other is a good idea and somehow im the troll to be honest something from someone like you that means nothingi generally believe that people have enough intelligence not to vote for a self serving idiot like tora so hopefully he will never make it to the csm but if by a miracle he does i give it 5 minutes before ccp gag him and kick his ass out
mike youve done many fantastic things for the eve online community and youre out there actively in the trenches of the forums actively discussing things with people im definitely giving you spot 1
you are on the list
sugarvery nice interview on cap stableyou are currently near the top of my top third tier you have good ideas and you present them very welli remain impressed thank you alan mathison explorer  industrialist star tide industries
boosters are not fine as is i like their concepts but they are are an abandoned neglected project that received a mild touch up in apocrypha the general idea is fantastic i love the idea of making choices and fine tuning not just your ship but your pilot to your situationUFFFDs needs there are implants that do this to some extent however the temporary nature of boosters makes them their own viable series of choices but they need to be revisited and updatedcontraband was introduced but smuggling never reached its potential instead itUFFFDs handicapped the market for boosters and caused them to be an inconvenience in a game where we maintain assets across multiple regions and sectors of space ether the restrictions need to go or smuggling a completely untapped zone needs to be brought into the current gamewe need more booster types i think that fine details would be fine the idea of the explorer selecting a mix to help him hack into systems better at the loss of other sensory feedback is an interesting one let them potentially harm themselves trying to string out to the max increase and decrease risks based upon the choices the pilot makes and the skill training they have put into it it opens up more gas potential in player consumption acquisition industry and marketing currently the role of combat boosters in the game feels as if it was only the first or second step to a much larger project that was never finished
youve got my vote
junei was more impressed than i thought i would be with your cap stable interview that may sound bad but take it as a compliment cause thats how i meant it   i loved your stating that you put the game above the coalition i think you presented yourself very well and ill be watching your campaign with a lot of interestthanks alan mathison explorer  industrialist star tide industries
so i have been thinking of ways to deal with cloaky camping that wouldnt be broken here is a idea i have been working on new anchor able structure potentially for pos that allows for submarine type pings give benefit to those still at their computer allowing them to warp off to a different safe and re cloak basically deals 1 damage or coded to turn off cloaks over 5au of space but still have to position them in a coordinated effort to depth charge a system and smoke out the cloaky camper forcing players to cloaky camp systems and walk away for the day to get killed by their inactivity while promoting active hunter killers for blops obvious concern is leaving these near gates and decloaking people as they enter system this is countered by a 30 second spool up timer and a recharge timer so they cant rapid fire keeping someone uncloaked gives the deployable team something fun to play with still requires teamwork and promotes people actually sitting at their computer to effect operations in a system i want it clear i think cloaky camping is funny and a good aprt of the game trying to catch people doing something stupid but it is important however i do not approve of people being able to effect multiple systems and industry while having logged in in the morning and staying cloaked in a safe until when they return from work it goes under the same logic as the hobocamping patch for interdictors if you are going to effect space your ship needs to be at risk some counter must exist to counter someone sitting idle in a system that equalized the effect to risk
so what can you tell us about kimsemus intriguing minds ponder
i believe hes moved on to other mmos but i couldnt say for sure
what is your opinion as a goonswarms csm representative about walking in stations should it be iterated on to provide an immersive and superior new player experience to attract female players because of the immersion or emotional attachment to a character to ascend eve beyond the niche willing to suffer through its vertical learning curvesource
i am as of today announcing that i intend to run again for csm 10 i was apart of csm 8 and i believe that i have a lot to contribute to this years coming csm through my years of experience in many different aspects of evei am not running under a particular platform persay just with the same goal that i did last time and that is to attempt to help and guide ccp towards bettering the game for all aspects not just in 00 where i livefor those people who are afraid that i am again another 00 candidate with only care for my own well i am here to tell you that you are mistaken however i doubt that i could disuade you from this point so i will not bother trying with thispeople who know me know what i am about i am open to questions about my ideas and thoughts towards different topics keep in mind however any trolling or attempts to derail the thread will be ignored by methank you for considering me as a candidate for csm 10
vote for sort
huzzah
i order to secure my vote i need to know your opinion of ishtars and if you were a soup which soup would you behe usually talks sense an generally has good idea you have my support
ishtars i personally do not like but if we are talking from a game balance perspective then my issue is less with the ishtar and more with the sentry drone itselfccps inability to deal with the growing issues of sentries while still adding more drone modules to the game is of big concern to me and will be something i would like to see addressed if i were to make it to csm
unless im remembering incorrectly you were widely viewed as one of the least contributing members of csm8its entirely possible that im wrong so my question is thiswhat did you do while a part of csm8 and what is the one thing you are most proud of having contributed to
hello again 
did you read sort dragonUFFFDs guide to diplomacy 
with regards to the first half of your post that is each to their own i guess i know what i did and how active i was and aside from that the only others that know about this would be ccp or other csm membersone of the things i am most proud about is the changes made to the fleet system including details put into fleet composition and such take it as excuses but i am never going to be able to tell you for a few years exactly what i had a say in or notit is important to know that some rumours may have come out regarding my inactivity during the term the only time i was inactive was when i was away from game due to real life issues for the last month and a half of my term
i wrote it
you never did answer that soup question
at least jail is your first good excuse for being inactive do you really want me to drudge up the exact same complaints that were fielded last time or do you have enough mindless mongs to support you again
aha so getting a lot of people behind you and abandoning after vote was your initial plan coughhbccough
be advised if he doesnt like the answer youll never get it from himjust like all of the questions around his inactivity for multiple years prior to csm8 fortunately for him and unfortunately for the csm he left pl and got in on the hbc vote
pumpkin because i love pumpkin soup and i cant get a good kind here in the uk
go ahead i believe i screwed up a lot in the past specially with how i handled the hbc situation and my main role in its downfall since then though i am happy to find myself in a great alliance with some really decent alliesi guess things turned out well for me though so i am happy the results of the vote will determine what people think of me win or lose thanks for the free bumps though its good to have my thread at the top for more exposure they do say any publicity is good publicity even in politics 
do you know why many considered you to be ineffective or inactive member of csm8why did you apparently not attend a single session during the csm8 summer submit remotely via teleconferencing
no i do not unfortunatelywith regards to your second question i did not attend them because i had just started a new job at the start of august which ran on a 3 month contract till the start of novemberit is commonly known from people who have been on csm and know of how the summits work that if you are a euro and do not get time off work it is hard to get in on any of the summits as they all start in the early morning eu and finish around about 1730 in the evening for the winter summit i however did not have a job and attended nearly every summit meetingif anyone is wondering i am currently unemployed and even if i had a job i would intend to have the time off for the summits that came up this is one of the biggest issues for people who are euros and want to attend summits you need to be a student or someone who owns their own business to be guaranteed to be able to make iti hope this explains and answers your questions
how many of the sessions minutes did you write up for both summer and winter summits
first one none second one i helped look over the write ups for the second set as nearly all were done by people attending the summits and then editted by people who joined in by lync later on
not in your case im afraid the more people know about you is only damaging unless like i said you have a large bloc of voters that is going to vote for you no matter what i am not sure that particular brand of lightning will strike twice
you are welcome to your thoughts but a lot has changed in what is now 2 years the people voting for me know enough about me to make a decision to vote for me so i will leave it up to them
its your reputation against your wordtry me to me your op makes me feel like youve blown this all off as a trivial necessity to be eligible for csmx and are completely apathetic towards inspiring people outside our your coalition to vote for you so lets try this again and lets keep it really simplefirst question why should i vote for you instead of someone like manfred sideous sion kumitomo or endie von postssecond question if you are not running as a bloc candidate are you going to encourage the pilots of your own alliance to educate themselves before voting or are you going to present your allies a prefilled ballot and ask them to tow the party line
whats your thoughts on fighter assign both in small scale 20 fighters assigned to a few interceptors and large scale where fighters are assigned in huge amounts several hundred
enlighten me
the game has gone full circle from 4 years ago where the nc used to assign fighters to fight insurgency and tri it was a strange mechanic back then and a strange mechanic now i believe the so called nerf is a band aid and will not change much with the mechanic itself i think a medium needs to be found where the people assigning fighters put themselves more on the line and the people who use drones are not unbeatable that it kills any potential for fights small to large scalei am not sure how to fix it at all but along side the sentries issue i still have a big issue with anyone being able to control anyone elses ships damage i believe that any type of game play where you can afk and do nothing is not good game design the more ships on grid the more people have to put them at risk the only good i do see from fighter assign is letting 1 side be able to semi even the playing field with another bigger group of players this however does not outweigh the issues with assign and drone mechanics in general
im still expecting an answer and it would appear so is missbolyai
honestly most exploits exist because of loopholes created with shoddy or incomplete definitions at the same time ccp runs into the issue of over defining and by extension defining accepted exploits this is kind of what happened originally with is boxer and 3rd party programs they have specifically said multiboxing is allow but removed a tool from multiboxers while i understand their ability to do so they have failed and it seems on purpose to adequately define the limitations and complete reasoning behind the changes multiboxers are generally extremely worried about keeping their accounts active which means following the rules we need these better defined or we risk losing our hard earned accounts loopholes are bad because they become widespread and then become accepted and then we run into the same issue ccp changes their minds and people either get angry lose accounts or quit the game we want definition the majority of multiboxers i have spoken with simply want to know why and what they can do most is clearly defined but alot is notcheck out my podcast my blog
cloaky camping isnt necessary to kill anyone ratting this is true but getting rid of cloaky camping isnt necessary to save ratters either as thousands of ratters do just fine on a daily basis the argument is flawed and can be applied in reverse just as easily
your insinuation that someone is disqualified for csm because they belong to this group or that group demonstrates an ignorance of what csm stands for cue patriotic music i will not stand for this walking out of roomare you really suggesting that mudstone need to cloaky camp a few systems before he is qualified to suggest changes to the cloak system how many systems have you been camped out of for days or weeks are you even qualified to ask this question of mudstoneive been cloaky camped for weeks and trust me i dont have 200 buddies to call for help in my particular case i actually dont want much changed with the cloaky camping system though ive never cloaky camped anyone i wish to reserve that for a possible tool to use against my foes in the future
ive never been cloaky camped into any station because just as you do i recognized that the tactic was not limited just to one side but to both i chose instead to make use of the method myself rather than complain about it and seek to change the game
at no point have i said that cloaky camping needs to end i just think it needs to be a more active activity we are all playing a game here so why not make it engaging to both parties im not a game designer i only seek to take collective voices i resonate with and will attempt to amplify them to the best of my ability to ccp directly if afforded that opportunityi just think all aspects of the game should be engaging and fun thats why i log in every day
would you support moving cloaked ships from local that way no one can afk cloaky camp a system and cause people to dock up
thats what wormholes are for so no local is a part of known space and probably should remain
i made a post on reddit with the suggestion of making mobile warp disruptors hackable and thereby able to be stolen the thread is here
the whole purpose for this failed jump fatigue system as stated at time of presentation of concept was to limit any group from crossing the entire map in minutes thus bringing everything and everyone from anywhere to anywherei would think that kiss applies here  keep it simple stupid so if we must be limited in this fashion a much more simple system can be used as follows1 simply allow for any number of jumps within max jump range of starting point for those of us who just want to travel within a set region2 for those of us who trained on black ops covert jump drives should not be limited if only because of the requirement to invest months in training for this3 go ahead and limit the jumping of others via my covert jump portal generator with your fatigue system that has been set up to have variants for certain ships with 90 this and 80 that butUFFFDi agree with u guys when you say  leave jump bridges alonebut  we all know that this is much like trying to skip rocks across the lake  no matter how many times we try  no matter how hard we try  the likelihood of getting game decision makers to agree with usUFFFDblack ops ships using covert jump portals with covert cynos are not allowed to use covert cloaks that makes sense
are the tears really still going after a couple months have passed probably best for you to find another game to play at this stage the jump fatigue changes have improved content overall meaning there are more wars and persons trying to take sov including small groups
hi i live in nullsec pl are two cynos over and bl a few cynos in the other direction without fatigue we would be unable to operate with capitalsthen you done goofed son watch your fatigue next time
just gonna step in and say fatigue has done more for letting overhyped mercenary wannabes operate with impunity than any other mechanic in history and you cant deny that accusation i flew with syj for years still love you guys except pell never pell okay pell too
anyone alive here  o
a option to automaticly group and load guns and scripts would be awesome aswel yust more difficult to make i geus
terrible ideaonly good for gankers like code1
are carebears the only ones allowed to ask for improvements to evegankers are people too this would be a massive improvement for fitting out fleets and has been long needed in game
its not only for gankers although gankers are paying costumers aswelany smalmedlarge corp and alliance can benefit fromit
i disagree with it being just for gankersand it is in my book of things to ask forbig events have people stuck doing fitting for days whoever runs fleet doctrines often is in the same boat especially if new players are involved i try to limit myself to 50 ships at a sitting pace myself but every day i wish there was a firt and rename all these things buttonwholehearted supportmgo on call me a gankermike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
yeah agreewoul make big events made much easier like the fight of 1000 rifter event vs a nyxwould have rocked to be able to provide some free rifters but now yust a pain to do that
gankeryou did askin all seriousness im glad this is on your list of things to bring up 1
jenshae chiroptera wrotei could never go back now would suck too much recons frigate links worst of all pressing dscan all the time cant face that again im genuinely curious to see how recons work out i dont see how theyre necessarily worse than whats already out there i do know that we tried a pilgrim doctrine before this round of buffs and it was badthe frigate links definitely make things more chaotic and our enablers and instigators were not happy about the new massdistance relationship when you jump through a whhating on dscan is sort of a wh hobby so since youre running for csm what would you do differently and whyjenshae chiroptera wroteas to the rest i still have a lot of friends that are still in whs the only one that engages hostiles does it because they have a standing force greater than anything that can come through a connection  due to the mass limitationswe lived in a c2 so if we needed to wed drop shortrange t1 battleships on intruders taking full advantage of the wh bottleneck but we also got a bit tired of losing to fleets that sometimes had more guardians than we had pilots so again since youre running for csm ccp and for that matter corbexx seem happy about the state of things and they feel that the metrics ccp is using mostly  of jumps through wormholes afaict indicate overall health so what would you bring to that discussion
while ratting or mining i would hit dscan often enough to see a ship in flight and i could escape often i would see cloaking ships just before their cloaks flipped on slower than manually clicking auto dscanthere are now shattered systems the new exploration systems as ccp originally envisioned allow worm holers to control access again and let them build a full settlement they cant make a block cant take over a region of worm holes stations and system occupancy upgradesmaybe stations only in c5 and c6 with larger holes from there into null maybe and i say this one very cautiously rare three day long holes with no mass limit connecting themi see nothing but good possibilities in letting alliances take over a single system completely they become this drifting force that spices up the rest of known space and with a station they can turn into real industry places with the way that ccp wants to have null trading hubs and have small null blocs these worm holes could be the tinkers of eve popping up with goods to trade and supply null friend or foe could be very interestingedit recons will be a perfect cloak in worm holes you will need a combat probe alt because you probably wont convince anyone else to sit around doing it no blips as they turn the dscan immunity on no knowing if they left a system unless you constantly watch every exist all the timescan deep for them in case they have a book mark way out there nothing stopping them having a regular cloak and a mobile structure
maybe you should just respond to peoples questions and statements instead of saying post with your main or how about giving accurate sources for your statements or how about not making up random bs to try and make you look good no one will vote for a lying sack of dunghey xenuria post like a manalso why can you not stay with a corp very long
xenuria cant stay with a corp very long because xenuria has personality conflict issues xenuria doesnt get along well with anyone just a matter of xenuria being xenuria which is only appropriate company for xenuria xenuria hasnt undergone the years of training required for ones of xenurias nature to acclimate with normal society to a functional degreeand so i can stop typing xenuria what do you prefer to identify as hesheitfoxwalrusklingonwookieevisitormunchkin just dont want any miscommunications
maybe this is a good thing but i honestly have no idea who you are xenuria so my question is why do you feel like there is such a strong numbered group of people that seemingly despises you again im only asking because i have no ideaive encountered myself groups of people that flat out contradict me simply because i write a few lines of text on en24 being in a somewhat public light encourages some people to be asshats to me hey people know that guy watch this im going to totally tell him off however im not sure that is the case here
its mostly that eve online is like any other game where people are given anonymity and a voice the difference is eve is brutal and harsh this mentality encourages people to attack that which they fear or dont understand i am controversial in no small part because i cannot be bribed or bought off i represent a clear and sustained threat to the system as it exists in its present form this concerns people ultimately the pronouns used dont bother me but i prefer feminine pronouns in the context of eveif you are unwilling to read the op or any of the subsequent posts answering the questions your asking than i really have nothing to say to you at best your lazy at worst you are attempting to derail the conversation by asking questions i have already answered

i enjoyed your cap stable interview too sugar youre still getting my voteim very impressed with the work you do with and on behalf of new players thats so important if eve is to grow and thrive
appreciate the support
i have several points of contention as well as questions regarding the answers you gave to wiggles on eve radio but rather than create a post a mile long i would like to just bring up one subject regarding character and how important you think it is for someone to be able to make decisions and provide feedback to the players or ccp based on having all the information which is a key character trait of a good csm memberyou recently published an article regarding nashh kadavr that clearly summarized nashh as the host of this event intended to scam this event for himselfnotwithstanding that you were personally on comms when nashh was being ambushed by iwantisk by your own admission you knew how emotionally worked up and tired he was after putting on this content for the communitys benefit despite knowing that there were no direct accusations made at that time you decided to run a half baked story that clearly cast nashh kadavr a trusted and known content creator in this game in a negative light with the title of your tabloid bordering on libel unlike the story i inquired with you about regarding the groon rmt accusations you didnt have the courtesy of putting supposed or alleged anywhere within the storymy questions with subsequent follow ups are as follows do you believe that running a tabloid article knowing that facts were still coming out justifies the rl stress this caused to a well known content creator and personality for this game if so do you believe that purposely driving out content creators is a good image that we want to set forward going into csmx furthermore do you believe knowing what you know now about the incident that its important to have all the information before summarizing it in a fashion that is completely opposite of the factsyes this is all tongue in cheek based upon your answers given on eve radio and subsequent behavior during the event debacle there is absolutely no way i could ever endorse someone with your values to represent my best interest on the csm during a time when its involvement and input will be at arguably during the most vital changes in our games history stick to tabloids please eve community blogger  the eve editorial 
i still stand behind the things i said at eve radio which i think answers a lot of your questions is it good that somebody has stress in rl due to a game nope but he would be the first or the last player to experience that the amount of sleepless nights i have are there too just because somebody did good doesnt mean he is immune to criticism although i do feel that i could have added a bit more of nash sides at the beginning but due to his emotional state i decided to give him some room and wait for the next morning im always learning on the go so i guess this has been a good case to take into account next timein the end of the day i appreciate and love nash work now this happend i learned from it i left it behind me and i am looking at the future
weve heard that before bobmon were you looking forward last year when you agreed to higher standards in eve related journalism back in june
you said on eve radio that you and riverini were different show me until then 1 eve community blogger  the eve editorial 
are we real journalists no we are eve players who write stories i understand that he is emotional attached and i am sorry for what happens but fact remains that people came to me with the side of the story that i wrote and so i wrote up up but kept all communication open for nash to give me his side of the story in the end of the day if he has a problem with me then he should come to me we talked it out and our relationship is now on the same terms as it was before this whole event lets leave it at that

glad you enjoyed listening sorry that there were so many technical glitches with my audio that resulted in me having to repeat the same thing three timestheres no point in winning a sandbox that everyone else has given up on because of balance issues for sure
theres a special place in our hearts for xander its an enigma reallywe cant deny his dedication to the community we admire his work  life balance and ponder how he manages to be an effective csm member with his attendance at undeniably top levels more importantly hes a catalyst of what makes the outofgame meta of this game so endearingand we love to troll the living st out of himxander of course you have my vote youre a stubborn hardheaded egotistical maniacal family man who always puts what the community and the game needs first above all the crap so youre basically mexander phoena for csmx or riotendorsed eve community blogger  the eve editorial 
as far as endorsements go this one is rather epic cheers man
i agree with vic jefferson on just about all his points especially the ideas about keeping new content in low  npc nullsec
freelancer117 wrotewhat is your opinion as a goonswarms csm representative about walking in stations should it be iterated on to provide an immersive and superior new player experience to attract female players because of the immersion or emotional attachment to a character to ascend eve beyond the niche willing to suffer through its vertical learning curve source
you have to talk to your boss lack of a better word about thatsource the mittani author
thats not much of an argument it just means that hes full of  tooi just watched sions presentation at eve down under and his particular area of expertise is exactly whats required to tackle the current shortage of women in eve should he choose to do so it has very little to do with the gameplay and very much to do with the existing player baseif he does im guessing that he will find an immediate ally in ccp seagull who is also allergic to the idea that there has to be some sort of pink gameplay for the ladies just make the game better
as someone who has been with sort for the past 2 years i can confirm he did change quite a bit especially during the last months sort might be a  sometimes and wont win the award for the most popular person in eve  but hes the kind of person youd want in the csm because he knows the game its mechanics and is not afraid to tell his opinion or doubtsanyways everybody has to decide for himself which candidate fits his own expectations of eve best and what he thinks should be the highest priority for 2015
tbh id rather a simple yes or no on is this broken eg
you need to read the response rarely are game mechanics black and white he addresses your concerns quite directly
diversity on the csm is important to me echoing jaynes question what would a csm without you but with manny sion and endie on it lack due to you not being on it what unique perspective do you bring that makes you a valued addition to the csm as opposed to squeezing out a voice from say lowsec wspace smaller null entities etc
wow jayne im surprised you didnt ask him if he steal beats his wife plus isnt tow the party line sop from entities such as the cfc that backed you last year serious question here to sort how do you envision your ideal version of sov mechanics what would you change what do you like currently
im reading from this that you agree the current ability for carriers and supers to assign dps to a different grid than the one theyre on and just sit next to a pos ready to dump the shield up is something that needs changing is that an accurate conclusion would you be in favour of a straight up removal of the ability to assign fighters to a player on a different grid from yourself
that is an interesting question and to be fair i think manny is a great candidate this time and i doubt i would be able to get more votes then him anyway the interesting thing to look at though is that manfred does not run an alliance that holds sov to live in sov for his members sion and endie however do but at the same time they both look at different aspects in the game sion who is very diplomatic and endie who has in the past had his hand in that alsoi would never say that i am better then anyone else because that would be stirring the pot and trying to create a fight with other candidates and this i will not be apart of i will allow voting to dictate who they believe in the list is better suited if i do not get in i will accept the people have spoken and possibly try again for csm 11
i myself miss the old pos mechanics for sov after having been through the whole of dominion i miss the old dynamics of pos sov the chance to have fights at what could be all times of the day and the chance for both sides to play tug of war this does not mean that i would go back to fuelling 100 towers a month to hold sov but i would like something a long the lines that allows people small groups who are not harassing but genuinely want a home in 00 to have the ability to do soi see that being possible under the rumours of occupancy sov but i can see there being a lot of issues alongside this
i do like the ability for assigned fighters to effect fights where the people you are against outnumber you by a huge amount so no i do not want it completely removed however i do not believe you should be a loud to camp gates with drones assigned or rat with drones assigned i want to see more to be done to see people be able to use supers and carriers more but at the same time put them in a position of threati myself own a super and i like being able to use it to sometimes level the playing field when i am against a lot of hostiles but at the same time i do not want to kill the fight because people are too afraid of them
but wouldnt it stop the afk cloaking problem
it stops cloaky camping as a harassment tactic but it does not allow for cloaking to be counteredfurthermore as has been stated endlessly local is unrelated to any game modules linking them would be much harder than making a game mechanic to counter cloakthe csm has to realize the limitations of the game when they suggest ideas they cant just demand the same thing whlers have been demanding for years just so they can gank ratters with no warningif you want to fly in space without local fly in whs if you want to gank nullbears deal with local its an age old argument and using it makes you sound like a whiny little girl
i dont remember asking you but since you decided to chime in anyway cloaky players have to deal with it when it comes to local but complaining about cloaky warfare is totally not whiningkeep in mind im completely fine with local showing cloaky members in system and only suggested it as a way to combat people complaining about afk campers
my thing is if you are afk youre not really playing the game
so is it a problem or not in your mind
good point and i agreeoption 2 of this proposal would not only revive it would also be a rebirth of the original content content that both new and veteran players can enjoydmc
for the sake of argument i wont argue this but i will say that there are much better ways of limiting capital mobility than fatigue its really nothing more than an enormous pain in the ass in every possible way and has severely hampered some other times of game play like blopsing which is not longer attractive as it accumulates fatigue
id be the first agree that fatigue itself isnt an ideal mechanic  id prefer something that makes it progressively harder and less safe to use instant travel rather than just increasing a timerbut whatever mechanic is proposed will in the end have to have the same fundamental effect as the jf mechanic has now making long distance rapid travel something that has extremely significant consequences and candidly its the fact of the existance of consequences rather than their exact manifestation that is what most of the critics are really complaining about
to whom it may concernhello i am a recent player of this awesome game but i am deeply into it already especially the roleplay element i just find it awesome and while i understand being ganked and scammed are actually legal parts to the game and i love that but the bounty system i believe needs to be looked at for intance you need a reason to place a bounty you cant place them on innocent players and the like as i am a very honourable ishukone capsuleer and dont engage in any pirating activities and yet a player placed a bounty on my head purely for the lols this honestly annoys me to no end as now my characted appears to be a criminal i would like to ask for a change to be implimented and if possible the bounty from my head removed if possiblethank you for taking the time to read my request and troublesregards alexi duo drakenovicishukone reserve military division
it used tobe like that awhile ago but they changed it before ya could not place a bounty on ppl that for example robbed ya corp as they had good concord standings etcor like ya wanted to place a bounty on ya competitiondownside now is that they place bounty on everyone yust for the laughsthey have mentioned they want to change the bounty mechanic but unclear how and looks more like changing it so that there cn be bountyunterswhat they could do is change the wanted into bounty or something so it looks less evil
and what if im against ishukone and want to see their interests suffer or im gallente and want to bounty anyone who has anything to do with the caldarior i want to bounty a bumper someone who mines the same rock as me someone involved int he same market niche as me someone whos birthday happens to be today someone who is bad at posting here or in localwho gets to define what is an acceptable reason to bounty you and why is say your posting less of a reason than a gank
in eve no one is innocentjust because you abide by the law is does not mean i or someone else may not have a problem with you for whatever reasonin fact there are many many ways where you can screw over other players without breaking any ingame mechanic or ruleand before you say well this isnt realistic innocent people dont get bountied in rl i must point out that this is very untrueif you take a history or current events course or two youll see many many many examples of people having prices put on their heads because they pissed off the wrong peopleexamples native americans in early usa history were scalped for bounties which included women and children politicians in various countries have put bounties on the heads of people around the world for media that insulted their religionpublic moralitynational pride the black panthers militant african american rights group once put a bounty on a us politicianthe list goes on
if the random 18 mil that you had before bothers you that much it will be interesting to see how you feel about the fifty i just put on your head
i agree with this it should be the old way i have read about it as soon as you mentioned it thanks to our good old friend google haha with a few improvements it would make senseyou see we actually agree here if you read my original post you would see i am a roleplayer i would be okay with a gallente or an rival doing it not a random for the lolz and then saying i am trying to scam them when i ask them about it like a moron if you were indeed against ishukone then i would welcome it but what i am asking is different please read next bit for more detail as i dont think ill have space to type it twice sorry  i understand this i like that fact about the game once again these werent for the lolz and did you not read the original post i am not that bad of a roleplayer where i think this is rl but i think it should be changed or atlas removed the wanted thing on your picture unless you are in enemy space cause you cant have a friendly corporation working for a group like for instance the caldari navy who is wanted by the caldari navy and onto of that if you are wanted you should have the ability to apeal it or pay something off so it is removed and high sec should be cut off from you as i am sure even you guys can admit even in rl the military wont give work to someone that military wants dead so to basically point out what i meani think the bounty system should be modified to do the following if you are wanted in high sec there should be a way to appeal the bounty ie get it removedrevoked player who placed bounty does not get his bounty amount returned punishment for players who abuse the bounty system ect to place a bounty you must have a legitimate reason like they do in rl life once again and the minimum bounty raised to something higher or have restrictions like cannot place on player you have never spoken to or a player who has not committed crimesi just think it is a system people abuse and after talking to my mate he has told me it is abused a lot just for fun like i have no problem if say a member of the tiber heth supporters or a gallente player federation puts a bounty on me but even in rl when you want someone dead you dont but a few thousand on their head its normally millions and for people high ranking like ceos and directors their should be a minimum i just want it to be treated like an actually mechanic not to be used as a fun way to annoy carebears like the guy who bountied me must have done it to everone else in the system cause everyone on local was going crazy about it i was traveling through the forge i am pretty sure it is an awesome mechanic but it should have addition rules or requirements high minimum bounties ways to get rid of it ways to get it lowered consequences for abusing it ect and in eve just btw there are innocents and then there are though who follow the law and yada yada i mean i even carry a black box and clearence papers in every fit i use just for roleplaying purposes and i have not broken any of new edens laws i havent targeted noncombatants all i fight are pirates npcs and soon fw opponentsps people in rl dont put a million dollar bounty on a guy because oh i dont like that ship or the lolz
people in real life arent demigods with nigh unlimited income players in eve are
and this is what i mean point proven are you at least going to give me a legit reason so i can actually feel good about this proud even or is this for the lolz i honestly dont care how big of a bounty it is i just want to make it go with the roleplay experience it would be nice when we finally join fw to have a big bounty but i still like it to fit know what i meani dont want to ruin you gaming experience of trolling people or having fun in your own way i mean that is why i love this game but dont ruin mine by that i mean give me a reason for the bounty would make it make sense to me at least
this is true which also means that they would bother with 50mil bounties theyd be 500mil1bil plus dont you think i mean if i was a demigod with a platinum american express card i would bounty my enemies into the dust not put half a level 4 worth of isk on their head
nothats the point of this system i do not have to provide a reason that is satisfactory to you before i am allowed to act i can do as i please regardless of the reasonthats called player freedom
and this is what i mean their is no cost to the other player for ruining some players gaming experience not me i mean i actually mean that one carebear in local that seemed like he was literally about to kill himself i like the system mostly which obviously you cant get into you head i just think it should be changed or at least be modified to give other players some freedom in having a choice t remove said bounties if you have the freedom to place them then the other player should have the freedom to remove it at a cost like doing missions for their respective navy to remove it or special missions for removing bounty i dont know but that would be awesomeand it doesnt have to be satisfactory to me at all but there should be a reason i wouldnt be satisfied that you put a bounty on me even if you did it for lolz but a decent reason to give other players freedom to play the game their way as you seem to demand for yourself both players should have a way to place a bounty and remove a bounty i dont care if it costs 2mil for every 1mil removed or if you have to do 5 level 5 missions to removed it there should be something for you know player freedom and all that
heh buddy most bounties are paid out in such small increments that it is quite literally pointless to kill someone just for the bounty they are without consequence and absolutely cannot restrict or impact someone elses gameplay experience in any significant way in fact the most impact they actually have is to put that wanted poster on your character profilethen i suggest you report him to ccp so that they can contact his local law enforcement but aside from that necessary action i do not yield to emotional hostage taking
okay firstly what is emotional hostage taking 00and i understand that with bounties and i dont care to be honest i would have done this threat if the bounty was 1 isk cause i like myself dont like the wanted poster however i do see your point but it still needs to have the ability to be removed in some way because if it is in one players freedom to issue a bounty then it should be that players freedom to love it or have a way to remove it dont you think btw thanks for the bigger bounty actually makes sense for an enemy of the gallente to have a large bounty so cheers for that one even if you think i am 100 against it
when someone threatens to kill themselves if you dont do something in their favorthe correct action is always to inform the authorities and get them the help they need but if theyre just throwing a tantrum and trying to escalate to get their way then that is unacceptableso aside from trying to strengthen your exceedingly shaky point by bringing up that guy i have no idea why you would have mentioned it in the first place as it is not relevantit can be
yes i know it can be removed via getting podded haha that is the reason for join fw soon so i can get it refreshed constently can you pod someone in high sec though if they are not flashing red or yellow even with the bounty still not used to all the mechanicsand oh did know that is what you call it and it was revelent to the topic hence why i bought it up some players take it as a personal offence to be bountied some take it on the chin and some fly into a rage but all players should still be offered the oppertunity to remove bounties or at least the wanted poster as that should be their freedom not all players want to play the game you way just like you dont want to play it their way so their should be some one to make it better for both players
why do you believe that you cant put a price on the head of an innocent person im given to understand that murdering people for money regardless of their legal status is a thriving industry in pretty much every country in the worldthe bounty mechanic explicitly exists so that you have the option to sanction a player who hasnt broken the crimewatch law but who has managed to  you off in some way
exactly read the posts people do it for no reason in this game they do it for the lolsand once again as kaarous has said we are demigods with unlimited funds we wouldnt focus on something so trivial wed focus on the big things and once again people dont just put bounties on people for the lolz not even trillionaries they dont just get a name roster throw a dart and go him he needs to die they generally have a reason even in rl do people just walk up to you in the street and knock you out for no reason no funny that he must not have had a reason this is what i mean i mean do you actually think that say for example placing a bounty on a brand new player for eve who wants to mine veldspar deserves a 1mil bounty or wants one maybe he just wants to mine no demigod is going to go yep that guy screw him and his mining ways he offended me no a demigod would ignore it cause our egos would be so large wed be more like see that constilation yeah screw that they have more sov and area then i do and they have a titan and would proceed to to nuke it not randoms for no reason or do you honestly believe that in real life their are people who sit in their rich house and email their local hitmandear mr hitmani saw a homeless guy today begging for change on my way to work from my helicopter window and i have decided that he will be my enemy this weak so ill pay you 1000 dollars to fly here here on your own wallet and then shot him with bullets you paid for then fly back to where you liveyours sincerely your boss mr idiotthat isnt how the world works and it shouldnt be how eve works with demigods with egos bigger then titans unless you leave house and then feel like executing next doors kid because you know he has brown hair
ok nice ya still onit hope they listen and aply it
im not sure after listening to your interview whether im relieved that you basically echoed your overall goal of running just as a placeholder on the ballotor if im profoundly disappointed that someone would use an opportunity like this to essentially have no intention of winning and cry grrmittani as an achievement no its both there was nothing hopeful profound or even remotely optimistic about your entire interview your thread campain here is all negative with nothing less than vitriol not passion but vehement disdain everything was grr this highsec isnt safe enough the whole csm process is a sham and you cant isolate a single specialty that you can point to as a core constituency sourcei understand your motivation and thank you for coming forward but at arguably the most important time in the games development history the attitude you bring to this campaign is the last i want sitting across from people like ccp seagullgood luck but 1 eve community blogger  the eve editorial 
i was pretty disappointed to listen to that interview and realise that the analysis of your problem with the csm process begins and ends with you intensely disliking the fact that other players are free to vote for people whom you dont happen to likeequally disappointing was your naive idea of votes against somehow empowering hisec im afraid maths doesnt work that way sir if the ebil nullseccers are winning elections at the moment because they can get more votes for their guy then theyre going to keep on winning elections with your idea because theyll be just as able to vote against people they dont like as youll be able to vote against people you dont like but thats a contest theyll win because more of them votehisec doesnt need any special process magic to win the csm hisec needs first and foremost for credible candidates who can appeal to voters with a platform a little more sophisticaed than grr goons grrr gankers grr nullsec mike azariah is the example that leaps readily to mind and he has been elected twice deidre vaal had similar success in fact theres every reason to believe that when intelligent insightful skillful communicators run on a hisec platform they are quite well served by the csm process and secondly of course hisec needs to vote your idea its far from new runs headfirst like every other idea to reform the voting process into getting more people elected of the type that the reformer likes theres no voting process that will deliver results without the actual votes and there is no bigger enemy of hisec enfranchisement than people who try and claim that the system is rigged against them or whatever you claim to be a student of the mittanis campaigns you may recall him commenting to the effect that he had zero worries about hisec challengers because hisec politicians spend most of their energy telling people that theres no point voting in direct contrast ebil nullseccers who run for the csm dont whine about how hard it is they spend their time getting people to voteand it turns out that telling people to vote for you is a more successful strategy for getting elected than telling people not to vote at all such a surprisethirdly you can handwave away the facts all you like but the reality is that a very significant percentage of hisec are alts belonging to players who identify as nullsec and the fact is that theyre not going to follow your banner any more than turkeys are going to vote for a second christmas since the 00 alts are the hisec demographic that is the most likely to vote i strongly suggest you think of some way to appeal to them without attacking their main playstylein summary i would strongly advice you to rethink your campaign from scratch and focus less on stopping the players you dont like from doing things you dont want them to and much less on why they shouldnt even want a csm in the first place and start emphasising how you can help the players you claim to represent do the things they do want to by getting elected to the csm
i really dont think it does concern people that you cant be bought or bribed every once in a while one individual may get ticked off by it while the majority of the community will ignore such actions as trivial you can call immunity to attacks all you want and the people with power will continue to have successful attacks on others while ignoring you they do not worry that your mentality will spread as well they shouldnt people immune to attacks like you and i are few and far between and nothing will ever change that the vast majority of the population even in this game are highly vulnerable to others by subconscious or instinctive choice and they refuse to address the basal nature which drives them to be that way instead preferring to assume it cannot be understood or controlled we are powerless to change their view on the subject because they dont understand it and they dont want to
any candidate in any election should answer every question asked to the fullest extent no matter how many times it has been repeated this is because not everyone is the same as you and so may need the information in a different light to get the best understanding and as to maybe get a vote from a satisfied character that is also how you are constructive even when faced with trolls as it can show that you can actually help someone and can be respectful even if they are not i have spent the time reading through this tread and it leads me to believe you have taken little time to look at other threads to understand how to approach those who ultimately vote in the election your right about possibly being the underdog but you dont win people over by calling them lazy for asking you to repeat your material for which you have based this campaign on as they may not understand it in way way you first wrote it in my eyes you are the lazy one i have kept this post as constructive as my gritted teeth will allow it and will leave the post with one more idea that may or may not turn this train wreck of a campaign around go through all of the questions asked and answer them like it was the first time hearing of them and do it with respect and just maybe you will win more votes peace out cc
can you give me some of your thoughts on exactly what you want to do to change the csm id really like to hear some specific details on thisi do worry about the way you reply to some peoples stuff lets say you get on the csm lets say you do put forward your ideas now considering we post in several places ccps confluence and also in multiple places on these forums some times people dont see stuff ive had to re link stuff to people a fair few times and your reply to someone from ccp isdo you really think thats going to help you get stuff sorted knowing how to talk and communicate plays a huge part of what we do and im sorry but you seem to really struggle on this
thats the same attititude that makes her hated in eve not the i cant be bought off bit but the look at my opinions and worship them if you disagree you arent worth my time to acknowledge because im superior schtick shes been running for the last several yearsfact is simple xenuria has ruined their reputation in eve on thsi character to the point that a german has better chances of being eleceted to the head of israeli government than xenuria does getting onto the csm
what do you stand for who do you representyou say the csm needs to be remade or reorganized but why exactly ive yet to see a single other gaming company do something like this its unprecedented as far as i know and i would like to understand why on earth you think its so bad as is youve thrown around stats and made claims without anything to back them up i and id wager a majority of other players will not vote for you based off of that alone your answers to other people dont inspire confidence if you cant answer a question you dont like and instead attempt to dismiss the person asking you have no business representing anyone
im going to echo this until the mountains rattle this kind of pieinthesky approach to getting on the csm was all the rage a few years ago a csm seat was looked upon as a arbitrary obligation that ccp had to fill and everyone with an axe to grind was simply led by that alone  a perceived chance to rage and if you didnt agree with the rage you were somehow less enlightenedthis is csm number 10 the relationship between ccp and the council has evolved and continues to improve people see this and are conscious of the importance of having candidates who are communicative focussed and have the personal skills to wade through the unreasonable to reach the reasonable as simon cowell once said its a no from me1 eve community blogger  the eve editorial 
at this point i am just going to outright ignore posts that are asking questions which i have already in this very thread answered specifically these kinds of distraction tactics wont work here and the simple fact they are being attempted is indicative of my success as a candidatewith that said if anybody has a question i havent already answered repeatedly please post it thats amusing even without the irony dripping from it i communicate very effectively its not my fault if so many decide to post in this thread before even reading it perhaps you should take some of your own advice and read the op original post of my threadi never said my opinions were worthy of worship nor did i even imply they were worthy of praise of any kind i dont think ideas should be worshiped or praised i also am not faulting anybody for disagreeing with me i am making a point to ignore them because they are using a very petty tactic to derail the thread my platform is by far one of the most granular out of all the csm 10 platforms yet a small group of people have seen fit to post before even so much as glancing at the first page
can i just throw it out there xenuria should get some form of best troll award because day in and day out we get pulled in to posting here and day in and day out he just blatantly trolls us with answers even a 12 year old would know not to put if you wanted to get anywhere with this i applaud you and its been great fun watching you keep up the act wait its not an act oh god
so youre whole idea is that the csm needs reform show me how the system is broken in the first place then show me how your supposedly going to fix itoh when i say show i mean give me proof not by saying null blocs have power and they shouldnt give me evidence to back your claims
just did my interview i was a bit nervous and am looking forward to seeing how it came out thanks guys 
nashh was just the latest catalyst i can point to dont agree to something just because youre sitting across a virtual table from tmc and cz then imply that doesnt matter because you dont see yourself as a journalist thats evidence to all of us that youre both willing and capable of the same kind of behavior on the csmif this was strictly about event i wouldnt waste my time eve community blogger  the eve editorial 
sweet i can confirm that i will be going to fanfest 2015  wooot partytimeeeee
you say jump fatigue has had increadable effects what kind of mechanic would you envisage that might allow an individual pilot to move his capitals more freely that couldnt be used by hundreds of individual pilots who all coincidentally belong to the same alliance or coalition to take us right back to the bad old days of capital swarms crossing the map in a few minutes jump fatigue adjusted to a minimal scale would be pointless  youre effectively arguing for the removal of the mechanic perhaps the old days were fun for pl but for everyone else the nullsec map was a festering pile of static stagnant boredom by the time the travel nerf was introduced in contrast there are now 3 or 4 seperate wars active right now i feel like you either dont understand what the jf mechanic was intended to achieve or else you simply dont care neither possibility is a compelling reason to vote for someone who is campaigning on a nullsec platformif you can square this circle and think of a way to allow individuals to move while stopping fleets from doing the same then youll have more than earned a place in csm x but i rather doubt you can your own alliance mates are perhaps the most skilled in the game at optimising any edge cases  perhaps they can help you design a mechnic that even they cant exploit

have some friends it can still take a long time to kill even if its just a small mediums and larges are even worse i want there to be a change i want to balance it giving people a better option to remove the offline tower while not making it too easy this is eve there needs to be a challenge idea 1 if the pos tower is offline for 30 days or more the shields go down ie the offline tower no longer has any shield hitpoints while there would still be bashing involved we would be talking a fraction of the time required due to how much shield these offline towers have leaving only the armorhull to go throughidea 2 making the pos tower thats been offline for 30 days or more hackable just like in the pve sites this adds both an element that requires effort on part of the pilot to hack through the towerUFFFDs systems while adding content for any player that can hacki am open to more ideas if you have anyvindicatorsvindis are supposed to be jet black they look cool that way and thats why i loved to fly them now i donUFFFDt fly vindis because of the changes the icon makes it look like a glossy megathron navy issue and the ship just doesnt do anything for me anymore i am not alone in these feelings many others have expressed their views on this in a past reddit post dedicated to UFFFDvindis are supposed to be blackUFFFDburner missionswhen they first came out i was really excited to try them i had gone through multiple guides and was ready for adventure fitting up different frigs to fly each used for a different mission i went around and fought each burner pirate at least three times i really enjoyed doing them almost lost my frig in one of the missions and even got some faction loot in the very last one i did i think these should be more available than they are now not just a random pop up mission that you have to wait for to come i am ready to hear ideas and concepts from people on how they would like these to be introduced more i think they could be an incredibly fun UFFFDcareerUFFFD option for both new and older players if more missions were introduced new levels of missions more difficulty etc i want to take this fun new style of mission and expand it moretech 2 frig logisticsjust like there are onis bassies scimmies etc i think there should be t2 versions of the t1 frig logistics frigates these t2 frig logis would go along with t2 frig comps such as assault frigs electronic attack frigs interceptors etc i have always enjoyed pvp involving ships under the size of destroyers and i think having these ships could make it more fun i would love to hear what you all think about thisnew corp logoUFFFDs iUFFFDve thought this for many years however never have i been vocal about this until now there needs to be more corp logo options i like the options there are now i am not proposing to get rid of them but to simply add more options in terms of symbols backgrounds and colors if it could be a combination of ccp artwork and player submitted artwork for symbols to be added i think this would be a nice update to increase the option for diversity in corporate logos i would like to hear what you all think about thiscapitals in highseci have thought a lot about bringing capitals back into highsec for the sake of structure shooting some people say only let dreads in others say both carriers and dreads i am open to both i think this could add a dynamic to high sec that could add some fun i also understand the concerns people would have ie 16 triage archons on jita 44 so i want to hear everyone out on this to get their inputclothesi wants hats if you do not want the option to wear cool space hats then there must be something wrong with you i want space hats more options for clothing for both genders in terms of shirts coats pants shoes etc i think this is an opportunity for collaboration between ccp and the player base ishtarsthere are so many things about ishtars that i am afraid to start going on about them because i may never stop i want to hear what people have to say about balancing ishtars reducing their speed reducing their tank changing ship bonuses etc i want to hear what you have to say fighting ishtars is just about the most annoying thing to fight and they need to be balanced the most common phrase with the proper tone UFFFDohUFFFDthey are in ishtarsUFFFDphoebei think if at the least its comical that at certain ccp employee worked on making the new jump changes in eve left ccp to join another group and tried to introduce a type of fatigue in their game this issue is polarized some people love it others hate it i want to temper it i donUFFFDt see phoebe going away but i think we can balance it better i would like to hear what people have to say on this i feel reducing timers andor slightly increasing ranges for capitals would be appropriate bring old rapid light missile launchers backthat pretty much says it i am not fond of the 60 second reload timer when its you in a solo caracal fighting a fleet of inties tackling you and your launcher needs to sit dead in the water for 60 seconds you can end up dead in the water me no like that i would like to hear your thoughts on that more to come in the future on current topics and new issues
please re read the thread as it has been posted previously though i do thank you for the bumps

alexi drakenovic bear in mind that what constitutes a legitimate reason is in the eye of the beholder and no computer or mechanical system can reliably discern intentwhat you consider to be a lolworthy reason for putting a bounty on a person i can consider it perfectly legitimate the same is true in reversewelcome to eve where there are no good guys only bad not so bad and holyshit you did whatthis game literally exemplifies moral relativityit already exists its called dyingif you were hoping for another way to remove the bounty well that would rather defeat the point of putting a bounty on someone wouldnt itexample hmmm someone hates me enough to put a bounty on me oh well pay it off and i dont have to worry about it anymoreas for the play the way you want to without being forced to do anything statementsunfortunately for you every aspect of the game is forcing you do to certain things for or against players that you may or may not want to do because that is how the game itself was designed to be see bring players into conflict with one another through mechanical freedom to perform any action they want even if it runs counter to other players freedomsexamples in order to fly ships and fit them up you must harvest build and move stuff yourself pay someone else to do it for you in order to defend yourself you must learn how the game mechanics work and pvp a bit pay someone else to defend you in order to live in 00 space you must learn to be really good at avoiding unfriendly encounters be self sufficient which may require either of the two above examples join a 00 group so you have supportyou have the freedom to do all of the above you just dont have the freedom to opt out of itedit btw i put a 10 million isk bounty on alexi because his posts offend me and yes i consider this a legitimate reason for placing a bounty oh no this is exactly how the real world works the only difference between eve and the real world is that in the real world most people are either too poor to afford a hitman too scared of the repercussions andor the costbenefit of killing a random person isnt worthwhile for either the hitman or the bounty placereve is a dystopia so none of the above restrictions apply here
oh i understand this all in fact you are right on all but one thing and that is this part it already exists its called dyingif you were hoping for another way to remove the bounty well that would rather defeat the point of putting a bounty on someone wouldnt itexample hmmm someone hates me enough to put a bounty on me oh well pay it off and i dont have to worry about it anymoreand the it wouldnt be so easy to pay off would cost a lot more isk then is on their bounty say 3m to every 1m or something like that so it could hurt the person with the bounties wallets quite a lot in the case of some players i have seen 1 guy i saw would have to trade a titan to remove his for example and thanks for the bounty i guess ill make up some background to make it fit with my gaming experience once i get to the pvp arena i can remove it in some valiant stupid attempt to take on something bigger then me haha till then i will make do but anywaysi just wanted to bring it too someones attention is all thanks for the replies though and different views on the situation cheersfly safe
on the off chance that you didnt start this thread in order to troll and  or increase the bounty on your head new eden is the pvp arena in this game
no not to troll honestly and i didnt expect people to up the bounty to be honest i am just trying to make it work so it stays in roleplay and i know the whole game is pvp but i mean where i can leave station make a jump join a fleet and then jump again and boom fight time that is what i meant
joining up with an established faction warfare corporation and living in lowsec will be your best bet learn from them and make friends even with nonrole playerslook i know you are big on the whole role play thing you want to stick to your story and that sometimes we who post on the forums can come down a little hard but the reality you have to understand that there are quite a few other players who dont really care about role play this is doubly so when game mechanics are concerned as such changes affect everyone role player or non role player alikeyou also have to understand that things can get really messy like really really messy and not fit into any real category of lawful or unlawful or any of the abovei guess what im trying to say here is this dont take your role playing too seriously there is going to be a point in time where you will have to make choices that may conflict with how you want to do things and you cant expect the mechanical system to accommodate you on that basis alonefor example in lowsec you may be confronted by a player using caldari character in a caldari corporation npc or player in caldari space and you will have to choose between shooting first and taking a security penalty or letting himher make the first move which may result in your demisesaid character has a positive security status and much higher faction standings with the caldari than you dowhat do you doheres another oneyou are now part of the caldari militia in a player corporation another caldari militia corporation has a problem with your corporation for whatever reason they declare war on your corpyou now have to shoot other players within your own militia in addition to your enemies the gallente and minmatarwhat do you donote yes this does happen i was part of faction warfare for years and have more than once participated in such wars against my own militia mostly due to issues that can be boiled down to only one ego may survive
yeah i am big on it but i wont let it ruin or limit me thanks for the advice and that though seriously it is good to get different views and all that and everything to do with the game as a learning curve like a mountain so thank youand yeah i am trying to make as many friends in both pve and pvp parts of this game as it makes it better when you have people to talk to and yes i do break character to talk to them and not sound like and idiot and i have other players online who do the roleplay with me corp mate mainly and yeahand i can see what you mean however in that situation i could always turn it to roleplay maybe it was the broker under the guise of someone else that kinda thing but i know it will not always work like that i just honestly my life sucks all it is is work and home and this is my only escape at the moment live about 3 hours from work so not much time for social stuff really so i like to become someone different if that makes sense and yes i know it is stupid so troll away at that but anywaysand what your own militia can declare a war on a friendly militia that is stupid and it happens often please say no i am thinking i might just go null instead now thanks again
no worries shoot me a mail if you need some advice about something ingameyou are one of us that is why you are herewe have milk and cookies in the back booze can be found in the room off that side of the hall try not to spill and antimatter ammo is available at the counter for 18 isk a unit i think the phrase when it rains it pours is an apt description of the whole thingintermilitia wars dont happen often but when they do it is drama all around and nullpolitics are even worse as egos are bigger escape routes are fewer and the consequences much larger in scopelike i said in eve things can get really messy because freedom is a messy thing in order to survive this you have to be just as flexible
this has been a problem since day 0 of the new bounty system thats suppose to encourage bounty hunting and keep people from using their alts to kill a pod and claim their billions in bounty
there are no innocent players in eve if someone wishes to place a bounty upon another player its their choice and their reason alone that mattersas ccp eterne once saiddestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i have to agree with those that are urging ccp to approach this topic carefully i fear that if were given a system that doesnt have interesting and dynamic gameplay as well as a long life span were going to see some serious negative fallout that will stay with us for quite a whileinstead i urge ccp to carefully consider each component and gather necessary feedback on the changes to ensure that players are given a system that well enjoy playing with far into the future one thats modular and most importantly one thats fun and engaging
and most importantly one that doesnt make me literally wish i was having a root canal instead this thread has degenerated to the point its become like two bald men fighting over a comb  doc fury
rushed and incomplete was what got us the dominion sov system im sure that ccp are keenly aware that a new sov system is urgently required in fact i know they are
this thread is exactly why i stated in my cap stable interview that the greatest challenge csm 10 will have is making sure that ccps execution is measured and thoughtout instead of botched due to high player expectations and pressure

been a long night and day unrelated things too tired to care right now respond to you guys at a later date just letting you know i have read your feedbackif anyone else wants to nod their heads sagely and chime in on the chorus there is the source they are talking about

your handwaving abilities are extremely impressive it will be interesting to watch the progress of your campaign
csmx interview
i rest my case
after hearing that podcast interview hahaha no way
bunch of information he cant put sources to
clearly members of oe are not my target audience recent api leaks and internal drama aside
perhaps i can provide an example of an answer i will take the antagonist position in the debate and attempt to demonstrate that the csm is good and does not have any drawbacks i am debating against xenurias claims as an example of how to do a proper demonstration of a point my specific point will be to suggest that the voting system that is used by the csm negates political treachery rather than facilitates itmy first attempt to persuade my audience will come in the form of a brief explanation of the voting systemthe council of stellar management in eve online uses the single transferable vote stv system to distribute votes to the candidates in this system each voter selects several candidates and ranks them in order of choice from 1 most important and down each player only gets to use one vote but when the votes are tallied a players vote only counts toward a winning candidate their vote will be automatically transferred to a candidate ranked lower in their list as needed to ensure their vote countsthis prevents the old go ahead throw away your vote mentality from preventing tertiary parties from getting votes should the voters be interested in a new candidate they can freely rank the candidate on their list without giving up the chance to vote on the lesser of two evils should it become the only optionmy second attempt to persuade my audience will come in the form of examples in which the system has demonstrated itselfthe single transferable vote system has seen realworld use in several countries including the uk the republic of ireland australia new zealand india pakistan and more recently in iceland these nations have seen a staggering change in politics with the introduction of stv with fresh new candidates cycling in and pushing out the old and unwanted parties and with politicians learning that they must address the concerns of their voters since merely defaming the competition is no longer a successful method of collecting votesthis contrasts starkly with twoparty systems in nations not using stv such as the usa or canada these countries see a wide variety of new and interesting candidacies die quickly since everyone is afraid to vote for anyone but one of the two primary candidates it fuels hatred and animosity between supporters of either party while all of the voters begin to feel trapped and powerless to effect change in their failing economynote how i have made separations and highlights in my post to make it easier to read and digest it is also clear and direct not everyone will understand it or believe it but it both states my position in the debate and provides others with my reasoning for my position this is a reasonable starting point but i still need to be prepared to answer questions asked about my position even if i have answered them previously if they didnt understand it the first time either i have not described it in a way they understand or i have hidden it too deeply in my rant and they have failed to locate itwhat i suggest for you xenuria is to write up a campaign letter similar to mine only in reverse state clearly what specific problems you see with the system then give examples that suggest your position is correct now i realize you have stated that the voting system caters to nullblocs and have used the prevalence of goonswarm candidates as a supporting example but you have not yet presented this in a clear and concise manner try writing it in the format i used above or something similar and equally clearthen you are strongly recommended to finish with an explanation of how you intend to solve the problem if voters are to take you seriously as a candidate they need to know that you not only agree with them but that you are going to support them recognizing the problem is not enough by itself if you do not yet have a functional solution perhaps your answer can be that once elected you intend to present your evidence of corruption firsthand to the candidates of the csm and work closely with them to explore other possibilities pushing minor changes as they are discovered to gradually reform the systemultimately you need to convince your potential voters that if you won a seat on the csm your presence there would have a positive impact on eve
my platform does not rest solely in vote reform i think where people are getting confused is they think the vote system is the only thing i wish to change if they bothered to read the op they would know its more that that i have consulted with my peers and the general consensus is that most of these posters are trolling and trying to bait an argument as a tactic it works well in spoken debates but when the answers are in text the tactic falls apart i appreciate you trying to help but i assure you that i dont need any in this context the people who actually care to know my stances can read them
youre too busy assuming these people are trolling and not putting enough time and energy into listening to them i dont think you read my post very carefully i mentioned the voting system as an example but my real point was that you havent formulated your points in a way that makes them easy for people to understand and respond to your entire stance on your issues are difficult to decipher as even the issues you present are unclear
you havent exactly endeared yourself to the eve community that cap stable interview was awkward to borderline hostile might have something to do with it just too much baggage
i am listening to your podcast right now and your talking about purchasing accounts for votes do you have proof about that can you get a link to show your evidencealso since this game is an mmo and a sandbox should we not be able to pay people to vote for us why should we not be allowed to do thatwhen you talk about connectivity what would you do to improve thatyeah dotlan wow such an answerso you are talking about eve players and non eve players in an example such a great way to make us understandred herring emasculated with my presencecan we get proof of your work so we know you are not talking outta your butalso you just sound like your all grr goons and about taking us down
its not my fault he didnt bother to do any research before interviewing me he confused me with lex arson and a few other people i am sorry but i am afraid i cannot make my stances any simpler than they already aremost if not all of my evidence has already been cited ccp is where i got my statistical data and the csm whitepaper is where i got the information about paying for votes i made a point to say in that segment that the mittani is exceptionally gifted but also controversial i think thats a fair statement and i am standing by it i dont have the grrr goons mentality you are attempting to label me with some of the people that originally got me into eve are goons just because i am at war with the cfc or taking sov from them doesnt mean i am unable to appreciate their legitimacy as a player entity
dear mr bangboom um i had to actually research to find out what you meanti actually got that from some guy that posted containers around in space his name was maximilian something rotasky anyway he had the word free in there and i sort of changed itwhere did you get your catchphrase fromah i dont think you are right there and i dont think i want total safety but well feel free to read some of the posts in this thread and get yourself up to date on what we have been talking about if you are really interested

got my vote as well
the jump fatigue effect has been great however i think the mechanic itself is a bit harsh cause it flows over into other activities then for the individual pilot i would make it so that your time between jumps is long 10mins or so through this you dont have any overflow of fatigue and it will still take a long time for a capital to move aroundwars didnt happen purely because of jump fatigue there were wars brewing before the changes were announced which actually were canceled by many alliances wars happen because the cards were shuffled allowing pilots to play again again the effect was great it just needs some fine tuning take out parts and put in new onesalso i liked what you said here
i have several questions1 where do you get the 10 mins from for jump timer any research done or just a number you pulled out your arse2 on justforcrits you were asked if you werenUFFFDt running but you could singlehandedly ensure that any other person in eve would be elected to csm who would you pick and whyyou listed 1 corebloodbrothers2 tora bushido3 manfred sideous4 xander phoena5 sion kumitomo6 endieyou said because these people all have proven themselves to understand the game and they are nice dudes to hang withso part a do you really think all these people understand the game be honest please justify your answerb do you think you should voting people on cos they are nice dudes to hang with is a valid reason to be on the csm
1 it was based on the following siege cycle is 5 mins  doomday is 10mins cooldown 2 a  i have spoked with all players some even in rl and yes they gave me the feeling that they would be successfulb  that was a personal statement and in general i like to vote on somebody who is actually a nice guy
updated second post with another possible idea13 sbusmake them single use so once you drop them they are dropped this would remove the defensive sbu tactic cause you would basically make your own system vulnerable this would stimulate multiple things such as more objective based fights sbu market will go up pi market will go upthis means more fights more isk for pilotsonces sov drops all sbus will be either blown up automaticly or turned offline easy to destroy
i rather think that were all hoping for a sov system rework sufficiently radical that sbus no longer exist but this would be a good interim patch
yes to everything exceptjump fatigueranges are great we went from a completely polarized nullsec to the current situation that has us with several groups all competing for dominance even the lowsec groups are more bold with sub caps now that they dont have to worry about being dropped on with supers every timemixed feeling on the rapid lights their dps is great as is their damage application i like their niche set upno to caps in highsec highsec should be kept unique nolastly we need more sun glasses
if we can agree on more space sun glasses i am pretty sure we can work through anything 
i was promised a shrine on your website for committing my support to this thread and you have yet to deliver if you cannot produce a simple shrine how can you possibly be trusted on crucial issues like making vindicators black again
living in lowsec my whole eve career and i couldnt disagree more with you the bolded part
i should clarify lowsec groups are more bold because 00 powers dont drop caps on them left and right but lowsec groups themselves are using caps more often now
well hello theremy name is lanctharus onzo and i an one of the cohost and writers of the cap stable podcastin early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10here is our announcement
and like i said before i disagree the same amount of capital kills are happening as prepheobe 00 entities were the smaller groups batphone or bail out rite 911 call now they the smaller lowsec groups can do nothing to use caps to combat the big lowsec entities now such as tishu oe snuff sc ect where as in the past they could have called someone to help balance the field out
balancing out lowsec fights by pulling in 00 powers hmmm
1 issue for this campaigndeath 2 ishtars
something needs change most groups wont use capitals in our area because rnest might drop us which if they had the ability to counter us wider jump range  bringing friends they might actually field something
you mention that you cant go to summits due to your dog however you did attend the last summer summit at the summits alot of extra talking chatting sorting issues happens outside the meetings themselves down the pub do you think you being there had a negative affect since people had to be more careful on what they spoke about since you arent under nda
june and i live in the same city and are close irl so when she let me know she was stopping off in iceland on her way to europe for a business trip i wanted to hang out with her i asked if i could invite her and was given the allclear so i did if that was a problem my apologies it didnt seem to be at the time and like i said i checked while she was in iceland and later in europe her dog had a series of very bad seizures it was miserable the phone calls were miserable nobody slept very long and nobody wants to go through that again so no summitswhich is a bit of a shame as if elected shell make a great csm she and i have talked a lot about eve the metagame etc and for a while lead sound together weve shaped each others perspective on a number of things i wholeheartedly endorse her and hope to spend the next year listening to the ndasanitized stories of csm awesomeness
last august i was in iceland as a stopover on a previously scheduled business trip to europe that happened to coincide with the summer summit i was in fact invited by ali aras with ccp leeloos permission to come socialize at the pub while i was in town yes anyone could have been at the pub eavesdropping so people should have had to watch what they said anyways rule 0 of infosec is that you never know who is listening to be quite honest id rather that people in fact practice proper infosec so the fact that i was overtly there and people were aware i was nonndaed should have just made people follow good practices anyways and should not have negatively affected things plenty of nonnda social talk happened without any problemsas far as the future goes unfortunately my dog had a rather bad seizure while i was in europe which makes it extremely unlikely that ill ever be able to take an international trip again as long as my dog is still alive  at the time i hoped that the trip would go smoothly so i could continue traveling in the future but it didnt my spouse did not enjoy making the 2am panicked phonecall to me and i did not enjoy being many thousand miles away and unable to do anything to help
hello gorskiits been awhile i wanted to find out when you wanted to schedule your csmx interviewexecutive editor csm watch  writer cohost of the cap stable podcast  twitter lanctharus
are you a official candidate of pl other thank your weekly blog and the imput stuff what else have you done this year for the csm
so i had a chat with people today about some random things warp core stabilizers should be disabled in faction warfare complexes there should also be some sort of standings loss mechanic for repeated warping out theres nothing wrong with warping out when a ten man gang lands on your plex it would take a fool to try and fight that but never fighting andor always running should be penalized the lp rightfully belongs in the hands of people that generate lossmails rather than devalued by afk farming riskreward here is pretty broken and its a shame as fw is one of the great ways into the game syndicate is a unique place its geography makes it viable as one of the only npc null havens for newer adventurous groups that do not want to deal with lowsec gate and station mechanics as it is not entirely a logistical nightmare to live in however there is no real stable source of income to fuel those groups now especially not compared to other npc null places the recent changes to the lp store are a step in the right direction edge implants are worthless and replacing them with a  hull hp set would be very interesting for niche hull tanked fits and freighter pilots  these would both be in demand and interesting as well as be thematically compatible with the intaki syndicate perhaps even an industrial that can haul combat boosters through high sec and not be pulled over by the faction police ded sites were perhaps the only accessible income and those are rapidly becoming devalued by the changes to escalations in sov null if veterans and new players alike had any sustainable bottom up income in syndicate it could hum with activity standings are a terrible trap currently once a character has committed to a side in faction warfare or done one too many mission grinding them back up is worse than having ones teeth pulled then gargling sulfur  an anachronism from games of decades past tags to fix standings should be streamlined the same way security status tags were and the belt rats or other mechanic that give the tags should be npc null exclusive giving them another unique export
kudos to vic jeffersonthis is one of the better candidate threads that ive read i enjoy the measured and practical tone to your proposals and that you address both macro topics and small things like actual ship balance few questions1 any recommendations on how to make missile systems particularly anything larger than lms more competitive in pvp 2 your thoughts on the recent balance activity with recon ships ie does this actually help all the recons and the major nerf of fighter  fighterbombers 3 what are primary ways youll want to engage the community if elected particularly those outside your specific alliance do you think its helpful or necessary to open your aperture up beyond your alliance for feedback4 what separates you from the other large bloc nul candidates out theregood luck with the election biomassed  dust  eve podcast
1balancing the larger missile systems is going to be tricky right now a good deal of the problem is that the larger missiles sort of depend on larger slower things being out there another part of the problem is drones or their platforms are just too good now as well  application wise and damage wise getting something to compete with them is going to be hard basically its hard to judge exactly what needs fixing about them given the environment they exist in currently  this would be a much easier call in a different meta 2recons are hard to balance you do not want them to be too tanky but you also do not want to have them be so frail as to be useless in a larger fight getting those numbers just right is hard given how many things can modulate hp t3s will still be king of real fleet fights i do not think this changes them all that much more capacitor is good though i view the fighter changes as more a preventative move against a potential exploit than a change offgrid links and offgrid assist are both things that sort of do not make sense to me3i primarily view myself as nonpartisan here with regards to alliance its a label and lots of people definitely do not look beyond it echoing grr goons i am running as a player nothing more i will maintain an active presence on the relevant forms and am contactable in game 4i am primarily concerned with empowering new players small groups and content creation everywhere in new eden i do not speak for large alliances or for their needs exclusively i am not officially endorsed in any way you are as likely to find me in npc null or low sec as you are in sov null if not more
thanks for the responses vic again good luck in the election and i hope you do well biomassed  dust  eve podcast
your theme is chaos and hilarity but your main concern seems to be minmaxers who reduce everything to a handful of optimized numbers and then complain that theyre not having any fun thats their problem not anyone elsesyour great example barleguet already happened it happened before the latest round of buffs to lowsec if memory serves chaos and hilarity are already available to anyone who wants them the people who are running highsec incursions instead of living in wormholes would rather run highsec incursions than live in wormholes they might not want to admit that to themselves because its so hardcore to live in a c6 or sov null for that matter but there they are when i lived in wspace i actually lived there because i wanted to i took an income hit relative to running l4s in high sec but that was worth the trade of not having to run l4s in high sec i would rather throw rl money at plex than do that especially if im by myselfthat said i dont disagree with the idea that especially npc nullsec needs some love the main problem there is that simply buffing rewards wont do nullsec anomalies are already the largest isk faucet in the game by a comfortable margin so bumping up the bounties just makes the biggest single faucet even bigger not to mention that because the bounties are fixed amounts the rewards are divided by the number of participants and so you have lots of solo anomaly runners and very little teamwork it didnt stop us from running anomalies in pvp fleets but ymmvso the question of how to restructure the rewards in nullsec is an interesting one if you look at the current model1 it penalizes group play2 its a giant isk faucet3 nearly all the rewards are teleported magically into the players wallet so interaction with other players in the arenas of the market and logistics are limited to the occasional shiny drop4 its the same old thing over and over and over again5 unlike the l5 agents in barleguet they dont scale with populationso given those and feel free to dispute them im open to correction how would you approach the problem of structuring rewards in nullsec
sometimes it is the ratio of carrot to stick that makes all the difference the classic prisoners dilemma is such an iconic conundrum because people are so naturally inclined to hedge their bets generally i do not know much about wh space thats where the scary people live but everything i hear about buffing lower class whs such that they are more profitable seems like an excellent idea more carrots where they belong most of my theoretical changes to npc null are isk neutral or close to missions remove isk via lp and tags would add value not isk anomalies dont generate that much of the income in npc null as they are quite limited and dangerous i would much rather add desirable items to npc null and keep it very differentiated from sov null when i first started the game scoring a vindicator bpc could keep you stocked on ships for a while now not so much i would be happier keeping the liquid isk faucet in sov space and just adding commodities to npc null to give them something unique without homogenizing them with sov null  every security band ideally has its own unique ways to contribute to the overall economy unique spawns or unique sites basically anything in space that produces an item that someone wantsanomalies though incredibly dry do produce emergent content the group play here is intel and defense fleets thats not saying they are fine as is or do not need adjustments but im not sure what those would be the ess in its current incarnation has an issue with being guarded by rats but i dont think this is the real issue with them rather the issue is that ratting is so sprawled across so many systems each system can only support a few ratters before it becomes overcrowded thus you never really have a critical mass of people that want to actively defend it and avoidance or not anchoring it becomes the dominant boring strategy perhaps if they were constellation wide or had some more mechanics to actually get both interested parties on the same grid like fw does or we had fewer systems that each in turn could support more ratters they would be more useful ships are blowing up in and around anomalies so at least they have that going for them over l4si do hear most of your concerns about null anomalies your points one and four apply to equally to missioning as much as they do anomalies so those are more an issue with most forms of pve rather than anomaly specific the ess tries to make the rewards more commodity based but doesnt quite do the job hundreds probably thousands of man hours have probably been spent thinking about how to fix nullsecs bottom up income  i dont have an answer either when you have people wtih alts in hi sec to make money for their low and nullsec fun having you do realize there is a bit of a problem though
hello sionwanted to find out when did you want to schedule your csmx interviewexecutive editor csm watch  writer cohost of the cap stable podcast  twitter lanctharus
hey lanctharus ill drop you a line in private
well hello theremy name is lanctharus onzo and i an one of the cohost and writers of the cap stable podcastin early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10here is our announcement
hello angorodits been awhile wanted to find out when you would like that interviewexecutive editor csm watch  writer cohost of the cap stable podcast  twitter lanctharus
you could probably just say yes or no faster than it takes you to type all that out
i have clearly stated yes i would like to see some balance to the mechanic yes
well hello theremy name is lanctharus onzo and i an one of the cohost and writers of the cap stable podcastin early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10here is our announcement
i too listened to that interview i have a couple of questions1 you seem to not understand stv or as you call it svt listing a candidate at the bottom of your ballot never hurts that candidate it can only possibly help them if you want to reform the voting system you ought to at least understand it you never said which vote counting system you would prefer can you please explain which one you would choose and why2 you claim to be a consultant irl but a simple google search of your real name from previous elections turns up your linkedin page which claims you are currently employed as a security officer at mcroberts protective agency is that incorrect what sort of consulting work do you do other than the work you described as looking at things in the interviewa note to isd i know forum rules usually prohibit posting of personal information but in this case the information was provided by xenuria during his previous csm campaigns3 what specific changes to the white paper would you make you mentioned prohibiting vote buying how would this be enforced why shouldnt people be able to buy votes in a game where one can buy loyalty supposedlycsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
very good questions1 yes i did mess that up and i apologize i do prefer stv too the previous system i do not however have the requisite mathematical knowledge to concoct a superior system2yes i am still an employee and my sora is still valid if you do a search of their company site you will see they provide all sorts of security consulting most of my consulting these days is more in the human service sector than the security sector i find fulfillment in helping people 3 i would advocate for the prohibition of vote buying and candidate misrepresentation for example sions thread states that his alliance has a long history of being new player friendly this may lead new players with no knowledge of goonswarm to vote for him under the pretense that he represents their interests on whyvote buying should not be allowed unless it becomes very easy to determine if the votes being bought are actual players and not just massive farms of unused accounts how to go about enforcing these things is something far more complicated than the original concept much of the same systems used to detect bots and rmt would be very effective at alerting ccp when a single ip or payment info is used to buy a massive amount of accounts again when those same accounts never undock or do anything other than activate plex this would also be flagged enforcing the ethics portion is a bit harder to tie down because of the impracticality of fact checking what candidates say i would at the minimum want the recent policy changes regarding impersonation to stretch to the csm
what a politician says and what its interpreted at the individual voter level are separate things all politicians though stand for their own interests thats whats wrong with politiciansas for your comment on goonswarm i can honestly say as a avid supporter of almost everything antigoon that until bni shows up they were the best place in nullsec for noobs lots of teachingleading low skill point barrier for entry generally flew in cheap replaceable ships they were and are new player friendly now if a newbie thinks that means goonswarm would advocate for giving every noobie a free skillunrequired supercarrier for havign a steam version of eve or something thats entirely the fault of the voter not the candidatein fact most of the issues you and everyone else have ever had with the csm system isnt with the system itself its with the voters and youll run into the same issue regardless of what system you use to correct it short of ccp arbitrarily replacing and refusing candidates just because and for balance in representation we wont clarify which isnt really voting at all its more the american system where everybody votes then those votes are thrown in a furnace and an electoral college makes the decisions which would be bad for eve
i listened to your interview and i want to mirror another poster in that your comments are borderline hostile and completely grrr goon i thought some of your comments were down right insulting to some candidates you basically said that they were cronies of large null sec usually goon alliances even though they dont represent them publicly or represent their play style you didnt know xander phoenas name and while not a big deal he is the person you wanted to work with if nothing else it made you seem unprepared as did not knowing how the voting system works listening to just one of the other podcasts would have given you an insight into what was going to be asked and it seems that you didnt even do thati have only been around since 2012 so i dont have the experience of the other csm elections but i have been very happy with my votes people i chose have won and some have lost and i have never felt like the process was rigged or bought so when you say those kinds of things it doesnt hit home for me because i see it differently with few exceptions the csm has seemed to do what i want them to do and that is help ccp move the game forward ccp has tried sending out notifications about the csm elections and they have tried not sending them out and both times they have been called out for doing it incorrectly the problem isnt ccp or the csm it is the players some dont care others dont know and we cant force knowledge on them and the last group is us the people who do know care and are involved we vote and your interview and almost all your posts before mine have been well rude your campaign seems to be selfish and worst of all you want to assume things about the csm ccp and players that i honestly dont think is a problem or issue your comments on the podcast were divisive rude ill informed and in my opinion factually incorrect you have had many problems just by hearing you talk with groups players and csm members and i am forced to believe that wouldnt change if you were elected i am looking for a person who is willing to work with others get along with others and represent players in a way that changes the game for the goodyesterdays weirdness is tomorrows reason why hunter s thompson
golf clap btw xenuria im a consultant also just a different security firm but our consultants are called security guards
i have removed a rule breaking postthe rules4 personal attacks are prohibited commonly known as flaming personal attacks are posts that are designed to personally berate or insult another forum user posts of this nature are not beneficial to the community spirit that ccp promote and as such they will not be toleratededit for clarification posting real life accusations andor innuendo whether they hold any merit or not is strictly prohibited on this forum posts of such nature will be removed and reported to ccpisd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls
absolutely here you go based on your interview on cap stable this is what i got out of it1 grr goons2 im gonna change the world of eve3 grr goonswant to find all the podcasts around eve online visit
just throwing this in here for people who dont fancy working through the various calculations on how an stv system works
xenuria you say people bought votes or paid for plex to make accounts to vote rig do you realise how utterly ludicrous that sounds lets do some math and assume that for me to get into the csm i need 9000 votes if we assume plex is 900m isk for me to get 9000 votes id need to spend 8100000000000 isk on plex to go with that theory even if we take plex or 30 day time codes prices from several years ago at 450m a pop that is still a rather large sum the only people that could likely afford that sort of isk are also the sort of people that can send out a jabber ping asking their coalition to vote for them and not have to resort to buying accounts to vote for themselves i dont think its even worth discussing the amount of time it would take to sign up sign in and vote on even 100 accounts let alone 9k ok so that idea is pretty preposterous how about we use real money to buy 9000 plex at todays prices thats just shy of 180000 usd ok so that idea is pretty silly as well even if we just assume to get 1000 votes from these methods the numbers and effort is quite ridiculous yes ccp said that in one instance that there was a mention of people using isk to buy votes however that was pretty public when the player claimed theyd do it and i dont believe they ever followed through with it and it was back in 2011
so if i put you in a room with a load of smug socially validated eve players and then moved you to a room with normal people what would happena nothing you simply manage to alienate yourself and offend every single social group in eve evidenced by your recent appearance on capstabledoes your mere presence emasculate people you must be in the wrong jobhow would you regard your comments of last year when you called an employee of ccp games fktarded stupid are you ready to quit flinging mud at people you dont like or dont agree with
i explained in the interview that former ccp dolan was not taking the process seriously he banned me from participating because he claimed i did damage to ccp servers in a cyber attack when asked for proof he cited a post on 4chan the stories and information posted here are artistic works of fiction and falsehoodonly a fool would take anything posted here as fact 4chan disclaimeri recommend you do some research before mincing contexts and content like they were some kind of distraction milkshake in most other games the impracticality of a caper or play is a deterrent in eve its a challenge you have to understand that people in eve throw money around in some of the most irresponsible ways imaginable no fit too shiney no election too costly
the csm voting should not be letting 2 of the same corp or allinace be members of  which is not fair to be having same people in same corp and most of it is cfc think the csm is bad idea
kinda fixed the csm voting as we allready know who will win even before it is casted as goons all vote for them self and cfc would also vote for them self
the csm vote isnt fixed asking your alliance to vote for you is not fixing it its simply asking your party members to vote for you your saying that its fixed if all tory or republican party members vote for the tory or republican party i dont think you have a true grasp on reality if you seriously think anyone on the csm past or present actually paid either isk or real money to get onto it its just not that important pays off well enough or cant be gained in other ways like prepopulated polls in years past or a simple jabber ping saying please vote for this list in this order or possibly you dont understand communities and what binds them means they dont have to buy votes its the gevlon goblins of this world that would have to resort to paying or those candidates without an alliance behind them who cant rely on a free backing if you think that a goon or pl candidate had to pay when they have a free source of willing voters enough to get them in without a worry youre barking up the wrong tree
why dont you run for csm id vote for you over xenuria anytime along with my massed accounts that i obviously buy
your opinions on  being able to buy and use security tags in all stations in lowsec   being able to store x password for posses in stead of just 1 delayed local and an upgraded dscanradar system to replace local period in null unless upgrades are in place
corbexx has worked tirelessly during his csm9 tenure and achieved great things he is incredibly passionate about the tasks he is involved with and with such a broad knowledge of the game his ideas dont just help wormhole space you wont find a more approachable and hard working guy he certainly has my vote top job matey
thank you for your post it got my blood up sufficiently to ensure i get off my lazy arse and cast a vote for the first timeand that vote will be going to mike
i was drawn to eve because it was described by a gamer colleague as a rich virtual universe where you had a lot of options as a player if someone had described it as a pvp spaceship game i would not have bothered to even download the client and just kept trying to get better at counterstrikeregarding the social aspect of the game  im wondering if something more can be done to encourage players while they are still going through the tutorial phase and maybe as part of the tutorial to engage with other players in their faction by fleeting up and running a mission together or doing pvp in destroyers against a similar fleet from another faction amarr vs minmitar  caldari vs gallente  dont torch me for bringing up wow but something like those capturetheflag missions where you join a room with other random players to form a team could work quite wellthe other problem i gather new players in highsec face is how to deal with wardecs well meaning corp or alliance heads will often direct their members to avoid the enemy in order to not provide kills while this is a rational approach  in effect the message going out to new players is dont fight dont mission dont mine dont haul get killed and ill kick you out so basically youve spent some money to play a game and youre being told to not play even midsized corps and alliances are not averse to giving out these directives now of course  some will say the player should just join a big alliance capable of defending itself but is that where we want players ending up by default these large entities also have their own rules and requirements and are not for everyone some players will figure out the best way to keep playing and avoid wardecs is to go back into the npc corp but that offers up a socially sterile experience at best unless you have other contacts ingame maybe limiting the number of wardecs a small corp can be subjected to in a 30 day period combined with making it more costly to wardec might allow small corps to survive and grow it is sometimes not the actual wardec itself but the fear it will be extended or that another wardec will come along immediately after that is the problem for the small corp and its members
sabriz has ideas that are both mostly reasonable and not based on obvious ulterior motives people in my alliance who dont vote for sabriz will be flogged then shot
changed your quote slightly please keep the hostilities strictly ingame
dont worry its totally consensual
given that shes an amarrian i assume the flogging was meant ingame as far as shooting i assume stolenreappropriated projectile weapons
i fully endorse this product andor service
will vote for core as alwaysone of the few candidates from a null bloc who wont be metagaming the csm
youll get my votes too like last timenothing is perfect but you try to push it in the right direction
i was quite critical of your work in csm9 or rather lack there off so why are you liking my posts either you are trying to get more likes for your candidacy thread or you secretly agree with me
sugar works hard and puts the effort in to make this game better for us she has my votes
endie1 in ncs recent alliance update vince said that everyone in nc should be working towards owning an sc or titan for the major coalitions it seems like supers have gone from a rare valuable strategic asset to a mandatory piece of equipment do you think this super proliferation is a healthy step in an aging nullsec or do you think it will stagnate nullsec and make it nighimpossible to break their fleets and put a dent in the old superpowers resources2 if goonswarm was started today instead of 8 years ago would they still be able to establish themselves as one of the major nullsec superpowers or would they have been repeatedly crushed by the older nullsec coalitions what does this say about the current state of nullsec compared to 35 years after the game launched3 do you think more nullsec systems should be added to the game if so should they follow the same mechanics as the rest of nullsec or should they have different mechanics to encourage occupancy by differentyounger coalitions
what would a more balkanised eve mean for the cfc does not the existence of the cfc and the other big bloc prevent a more balkanised eve i guess what i mean is that any changes to the game to bring about a more balkanised eve must mean breaking the power of coalitionshow does this sit with you as a senior goon and what do you think can be done to balkanise nullsec
hes already addressed these in his articles on sovtldr the giant coalitions exist because its too easy to take sov sheer firepower at specific timers is the biggest determining factor in sov so a few dozen people with superst3s could take sov from hundreds of players that dont have similar resources without breaking a sweat hence everyone has to band into coalitions with equal firepower just to survive remake sov so its persistence not firepower that determines who controls sov so that a group of 100200 newbros can force nc to put time  dedication into taking a single system from them rather than steamrolling them with a dozen supers whenever their reinforcement timers pop and the gigantic coalitions will no longer be necessary to survive once giant coalitions are no longer necessary theyll fracture because its a pain in the ass to keep 12000 people cooperating with each other
while thinking about things to ask you i thought about more tools for npsi communities and how they could also help other types of groups as well i thought of a tool with the same structure as a corp but for a profession or hobby that you do in game with people that arent necessarily in your own corp you could join it just like a corp but perhaps its a little more limited in its benefits so its not just a repetition of corporations we have today my thoughts were a chat channel group bookmarks some roles such as comm officer and maybe station offices with those tools people that fly npsi suicide gank haul incursions etc could enjoy the ability to stay in their main pvppvewhatever else corp and also be connected with those that they do their other part time hobbies with in a more structured and useful way i feel like this is exactly or close to what you are suggesting but i wanted to hear more on it from you if possible thanks
i flew under manny during the halloween war this man knows his  1 from all of my accounts good siras for a question ill get back to you when i have one worth asking
i dont know manny and never have flown with himhowever when talking about the game he makes so much sense so will be number 1 on my ballot
i like eve 24 it is good unbiased news
sarcasm
i have found an awesome example of something i want to see more off regarding csms publicity
id vote for him
you said you would be pushing for more clothes but didnt specify what sort of styles currently i feel that especially in terms of colours the vast majority of clothing options lack extravagance as someone who expresses themselves through their clothes this makes me very sad indeedwhat are your thoughts on introducing clothes that vary greatly in both style and colour were all immortal space gods surely we should be able to wear neonrainbow polkadot bellbottoms for example
you do understand that you cant have force projection effectively nerfed and have regions like drones and your example of period basis easily accessible at least not without significant modifications to the geography of the eve map which could create some serious complications omist may actually be a better example as you can get to period basis via jf via npc null its kinda of ugly but possible omist tenal much of the drone regions is basically impossible to get to without being blue to the individuals up the pipe form you just something for you to think about from your original op you seem to suggest that we are still living in an age of supercaps online even with force projection nerfs and scarriers significantly limited drone bays  drone selection options what do you see supercarriers positions being in the games meta i personally think that other than being hard to kill supercarriers by in large are pretty well balanced kill there 1 flight of fighters and they are harmless to subcaps i suspect you largest issue may be with scaling noteably that supercarrier pilots by in large tend to coalesce into a few capital heavy groups ie pl nc goons ect
 junei dont think you are grasping the point whether you were oked to be there or not doesnt really matter the problem is that the csm has a limited time with ccp devs from what i have heard especially the relaxed times at the pub can be very us
you are asking a loaded question that presumes an unjustified assumptioni answered the original question without the unjustified assumption above already my viewpoint is that the csm should not discuss ndaed material in public settings and that a pub counts as a public setting it is not required to discuss ndaed material to have relaxedsocial time be productive and useful
concern acknowledged i do think there are some clever ways as far as making nullsec more capable of supplying itself without having a dependency upon jump freight in order to mitigate that problem but yes you are correct that there is a tension there the main issue remaining with supers is the massive spidertanking ability supers already enjoy the huge advantage over dreads of being ewar immune when being moved and not having to siege in order to apply their damage they dont also need the ability to spidertank such that 20 of them are functionally untouchable if theyre made much thinner and more in the style of tier 3 bcs that dish out damage but die if tackled theyd be substantially better balancedhero mildir has had some discussions about how to counter supers unfortunately we dont believe that killing flights of fighters actually is practical and useful with the way that massed supers currently are used subcapital fleets cannot remain on field against massed fighters plus a few nighinvincible battleshipstech3 antibombers with triageslowcat support two solid waves of bombs must connect for fighters to dieif you have a better mechanism to suggest for just killing the fighters im all ears but its easier said than done
we had a great time afterwards actually although aforementioned dog issues combined with a hangover made hiking a somewhat ambitious planas for why invite herwhy else does one invite someone to a bar hanging out and having fun is a thing i didnt want to have to pick between social groups so i asked about it she worried about being welcome i said itd be totally fine are you expecting someone to turn down a goodfaith invitation to socialize because theyre worried about something coming up despite assurances its completely legitseriously if this is was a problem its a problem with me not june ive been known to fall victim to geek social fallacy 4 before it happens talk to me or ccp leeloo about it and go back to asking june tricky questions about oh i dunno the position of newbie coalitions in eve or something like that
i totally agree it is an issue ali caused not june june however could have prevented it by saying it was better to meet seperately you cut the csms valuable and constructive time with ccp just because you can invite her doesnt mean you should have however you are not running again ali so i stopped caring she however might get into the csm and therefore is a concern as a potential csm member you should be able to handle tricky or loaded questions without becoming too defensive responding to someone asking if they have stopped beating their wife isnt quite a constructive answer if you dont know what i am referring to read reddit people
you are dodging the question lets have a link fightby the way your viewpoint about whether a particular discussion should or shouldnt occur isnt germane it seems like that at least one of the csm who was there had an issue with your presence also discussions at public venues can remain private as long as nobodys too drunk to keep their voices under control but that assumes everyone in the conversation is an appropriate participant you werent so perhaps your presence stifled any option to continue productive workhas hero identified a candidate for this years csm yet do you suppose that they have one are you actively campaigning to be that person if there is someone else selected to be the coalition candidate will you step aside so as not to split their vote and possibly cost them a seat
i cannot speak for hero regarding any kind of official coalition balloting lquid drisseg is the person determining that as per the cnm meeting notesas i said originally i ran without regard to whether i was getting support from my blues i would be delighted if i were placed anywhere on the hero ballot at all but i expect my support to come from sources inside and outside hero the stv process means that the concept of vote splitting is meaningless as long as people vote a sufficiently long slatei intend to endorse anyone that i feel would make a good csm candidate regardless of whether they are in hero or not
i have sent you a mail hope to hear back soon
did you read the op where i specifically listed some of the actual concrete things i have achieved this term
are you happy with the current state of the jump fatigue mechanicsactually i will go into more depth here i dont think any rational indivdual will argue that having fatigue as a part of the game is bad but as currently implemented the upper level punishment for generating a large amount of fatigue seems overly harsh mainly i am referring to the upper boundry where once you are 30 days of fatigue if you want to realistically be mobile agian via jb titan bridge or in a capital you essentially have to sit and wait nearly the full 30 days before doing an activity that generates fatigue so this in mind how do you feel about the state of jump fatigue mechanics
this is something that i want changed to the idea was to stop rapid movement over large distances but giving someone a 30 day punishment where that player cant use jbs or jump drives is way to harsh it should be max a few days or a week at the most this would still achieve the intent but wont completely handicap a player for a unreasonable amount of time
first im a little bit drunksecond i think you were in office while i was just starting my eve career and i just want to know if it is true that you started a war over comments made at fan fest if so do you think it was a good idea and do you regret doing i am just asking because i think honesty and openness is a big part of being a successful csm i dont care one way or the other because i just want to hear it from the horses mouth to turn a phrasethird i am a solo carebear player that likes to mine roids and explore highsec and lowsec do you think that making mining anoms nonscannable has hurt carebear miningfurthermore would you agree that switching wh anoms and mining anoms would help for example making wh anoms show up like mining anoms do now and changing mining anoms to a thing that has to be scanned down i feel yes i used the word feel that right now mining anoms enables gankers and unenables people whom might want to explore wh changing wh anoms to an open warp to mechanic could give wh more action do you believe that changing them would help or hurt the gamelastly i think that the jump fatigue is a good thing and even though i have never fought in a large battle or been a part of a fleet that jumped across the galaxy to fight in a news worthy fight that jf is good for the whole of the game again i just want to hear a response from a person whom has done these things and is running to represent me there is no wrong answeryesterdays weirdness is tomorrows reason why hunter s thompson
yknow what the great thing about rerunning for csm isyou can make claims about what you did or did not do on your term since its all under nda anyway you dont have to prove it and no one else can present evidence to the contrary
i was reading through some old csm minutes and i saw the issue of high sp characters stuck in titans and other caps raised this has been discussed quite a bit and perhaps someone has already though of my idea but i thought why not share if it may make the game a bit better i dont even own a capso my idea is to allow titans and maybe supercarriers to enter a sort of stationary mode basically allowing the pilot jc out it might be necessary to restrict this only to supers inside pos shields to prevent sneaking supers into a system from becoming too op a tactic but thats it this ship itself should either disappear or stay inside the pos shields unable to be boarded or otherwise  withof course coalitions and alliances will want to have a good number of deployable supers at all times but thats a strategic decisionthis also already happens to some extent with holding characters im not sure how widely adopted those are and besides my proposed method of doing it seems way more convenientso what do you think

fwiw the amount of votes you needed to get elected last year was 830 which makes that number a lot more reasonable still insane but within the realm of possibility i mean 700b is easily doable for example that was the sponsorship that iwantisk provided to eventmaybe the gambling websites should just elect their own members ahahaha i dont like where this is going
the people who cry fixed are the ones who cant win it outright to begin with instead of admitting they werent good enough or no one voted for me they play the fixed card typical
i never said it was fixed the only thing typical is the percentage of posters here that didnt bother reading anything before clicking post satirical or not this is kind of my point ccp has such robust methods to shut down bot and rmt farms yet these same methods are not used for vote farming the legitimacy of voting blocs is not in questioni take issue with the reality that according to ccp and the csm whitepaper there is not a single policy prohibiting the wholesale purchase and plexing of accounts for the sole purpose of vote power buying loads of accounts and actually playing them or using them is entirely different than only ever logging them in to plex them

i dont have the time or patience to read this entire threadhow do you feel about ganking innocent miners and haulers in high sec
there is nothing innocent about miners or haulers they are economic combatants in market warfarejust as drones are a good countermeasure against ecm in starship combat gank ships are a good countermeasure to mining barges in market warfareif the miners and haulers want safety highsec offers them the tools to seize it they need to learn to use those tools
im trying really hard to envision guilty miners
its not hard the miner who is gathering resources to build ships that will support the alliance that is trying to take your sov the miner that is flooding the market with underpriced from your point of view ore possibly gathered by eulabreaking means devaluing your efforts the rival mining corp that organizes a fleet and takes most of the ice after the anomaly spawns in your home system leaving you without fuel to run your industry pos there are are plenty of reasons that miners are guilty of working against your interests you gotta love the sandbox
i dont see miners as guilty but then i dont see anyone else as guilty either were all just having a lot of fun in the sand box people need to realize its just a gameganking barges in highsec can be a method to boost mineral prices or a tool for boosting the value of ones killboard or perhaps even as a way to fulfill ones own belief that miners should be eliminated and these purposes as well as many other possible purposes can all have a wide variety of motives and specific reasoning behind them all in all everyone has their own reason for doing what they do and we group together with people who have similar yet not the same interests
thisor you may have no concerns whatsoever about mining but you might desire to increase sales of the hulks you build
whelp im ashamed of having initially written you off simply due to your alliance ticker  i should know better than thatafter having actually read your op i have to say im rather impressed with your platform and a lot of the points that youve made regarding highsec im going to have to take a listen to the soundclouds youve posted and i must say im looking forward to your interviews with both cap stable and just for crits too many who have come before you simply spew the same old tired lines about theme parks and tears its quite refreshing to hear a well reasoned and passionate voice supporting highsec conflicti have three questions for you all of which i have chosen to ask because i myself have not formed an opinion on them one way or another  id love to hear what you think and why please dont assume that these questions are asked with a bias as i have none and i most certainly wont be upset if you answer the question in a certain way as long as your opinions are backed up my first question is regarding the formation of highsec groups and corporations prefacing this with my opinion that conflict in eve is always a good thing do you feel that the current corporation mechanics are sufficient for nonpvp groups to handle wardecs and other forms of nonconsensual pvp if no what changes to corporations and alliance would allow for groups of players to form highsec based entities and still be able to resist or better yet fight back against a pvp centric organizationagain with wardecs what do you think about changing wardecs to a regional or decentralized system instead of the current universal license to ignore concord for example maybe the war is only valid if your target is in a mining barge or located in jita a much more detailed version of this idea was proposed by marlona sky if youd like to look it up for reference i dont have the link handylastly mike azariah half jokingly proposed a peace dec mechanic where instead of one corporation essentially forcing the pvp playstyle upon a nonpvp entity the tables are reversed in essence it would be conducting nonconsensual pve against a pvp target forcing them to do some sort of nonpvp activity ignoring the specifics of the proposed mechanic what do you think about a concept of the peace decthats all for now
sugar will likely always be my top vote easily the mvp of the csm
good reply however the question was directed at endie and its his opinions i am interested inas far as i can see the pp nerfs have had little effect on nullsec its still in a state of stagnation and while null is dominated one coalition it always will be regardless of any changes to sov ccp makes
im not sure how the cfc could have done any better could anything less or more really be expected of us
sounds like youre certainly on the right pathwhen you say that is the exact intent of the proposed change and precisely where the current mechanics fall short
besides the fact that jayne has created a huge amount of content for the game and community already with the upcoming corp mechanics revision theres probably no one more needed on the csm than him
thanks for all the support

for those of you interested in the csm process i highly recommend reading ccp leeloos dev blog from today wherein i detail what i feel my accomplishments were this term
actually i think this is pretty fair cop the things you list are the weekly updates and having played a small part in the null sec discussion you specifically talk a lot about ccp and the csm but dont list your actual contributions additionally you mention in the ccp dev blog about the input broadcasting which was a pretty hot topic for most csm members do you see your role as mainly an unofficial csm reporterthe other question is pretty fair are you an official pl candidate
could you to give an example of a change to the game you have advocated for while on the csm that would be good for the game in general in your estimation but potentially bad for your own corporationalliancecoalition as an ingame entity
unless someone else also on the csm calls you out id take that at as evidence
sorry for my lack of answering i had monday tuesday as my weekend with the wifethe war i wanted never started due to my own self making comments at fanfest that in itself helped to bring down the coalition i was at that time at the helm ofdo i regret it nope not at all some of the things i said at fanfest i am disappointed in myself for saying some of the things i did i generally do not like to talk eve when i meet people in real life and even though my wife told me on numerous occasions to shut my mouth i did not i have never hid anything regarding that time just that their is 2 sides to every story and my side i should have been more vocal or in some cases less vocalregarding your last point in some ways fatigue has helped the game a lot but in other ways it has really hindered it i never agreed with the mass power projection of the old days but i find myself leading an alliance of newer older and mid level players and with this i find that people are ending up knee deep in fatigue that they should not have simply because the system that could have been quite easily adapted to be a whole lot simpler the unfortunate thing is that ccp is never known for doing things the simpler way they always over extend then nerf back towards what they want i had hoped that if they made some jump changes it would not end up in some pilots with 30 days without being able to jump and the only way to combat that being log out for 30 days or fly the whole time in a frigin summary as i may have gotten a bit off topic with your last question i do believe the idea behind the concept of fatigue was good but the implementation like we see with ccp every time was poor and not completely thought out
well honestly sort the major reason with fatigue particularly your coalition is that youre trying to fight on two fronts to defend a fairly vast empire so yes you have members that get 30 day jump fatigue but what do you expect when you fight both in delvefountain and the south
see that is not true most of my guys who have 30 days fatigue come from basic travel around delve we rarely take titans or jump bridges far out of delve we probe wormholes which we have in abundance and then use them it would be nice to have a fatigue bonus inside of your own sov to help with defence outside of that i do believe it should be effected for surebut please tell me more about how much alliance has fatigue from 2 fronts 
having met you in rl and my discussions with you throughout the past couple of years i am pleased to support your campaign good luckhost of high drag podcast
i support the idea of expanding captains quarter they are kind of an embarrassment right now at the very least id like the ability to modify the quarters with decorations though ultimately theres no point to walking in stations if we cant interact with other players
those that are complaining shouldnt have a super then as most super pilots have alts since this game is based on what you can do with how many alts you have
then alliances will be able to stockpile titans and supers without concern for having pilots for them thats a hilariously bad idea supercapital proliferation is a big enough problem as it is
you should post with your mains like xenuria wants us toi wonder could xenuria be using mass amounts of accounts to vote for him
i actually think socialcorps as a middle ground between npc and real corps is a horrible idea and just another carebearproffed stealth nerfhisec idea to make those that refuse to put mind in motion yet another mechanism to avoid wars entirely when they are today already 100 consensual because you can just hide out in said npc corp the answer to making wars meaningful isnt giving carebears both a 0 tax rate dodge and 100 protection from wardecs with a social corp abomination tora you listeninghowever i do think overall i would still rather a tora bushido on the csm who at least actually knows what the fck he is talking about re war mechanics than a mike asariah or nullbear who would simply nerf the hell out of hisec war mechanics and kill the entire vibrant hisec mercenary community in the processim not sure where our csms lost the fcking plot on the concepts of htfu and nonconsensual conflict being core to what eve is about and in the quest for moar subs decided to throw the baby out with the bathwater but i do believe tora and sabriz will at least seek true balance with any proposed changes by ccp not help ccp slit their own throats like a carebear or nullbear csm who is clueless about hisec mechanicsf
i think it will do exactly the opposite i want to drag people out of the npc corp and into a normal corp its like when you let someone taste some food for free hoping they like it so much they will buy it themselves so in this case let them see why a corp can be much more fun then npc in the hope they create a normal corp if they dont nothing is lost as they normally would have stayed in the npc corp anyway you can only win this way i do agree on the tax thing it shouldnt be 0 or it will just be a way to avoid taxes
reading some of the other csmx candidates posts makes me wonder if i should increase the dark side in my campaign all i read is nerf nerf nerf nerf what happened to all these carebears htfu 
my opinion about ganking is the same as lootwhoring on stations1the ganker should not be able to dock for 15 minutes  we all know he will pod his way out so he can warped to a safe en wait it out there 2as for the person that takes the loot of the ganked ship or any loot in general that isnt his no docking for 15 minutes and work out a no warp security system wich will prevent the suspect at that moment not able to insta warp to a safespotthis will rule out 1 of the most irritation issues in high sec atleast thats my opninionsecond i dont see whats the fuzz is about on high sec wardecking or why it should be nurved because a null carebear doesnt like it the only 1 in my opinion who can talk about wardecks in highsec should be the top highsec wardecking corps they know what is fair and what is not nerfing the  out of it due to losing isk in highsec is not a mechanic faillure but a alliance faillure educate your members and isk should not be lostjust my 2 cents
i added numbers to make my opinions more clear1 i wouldnt have any problem with that but i think having to travel in order to cash in your tags opens up the possibility of people getting popped with a cargo full of tags not that it couldnt happen but it would happen less with the system as it is now the tags are all being concentrated in a few systems which makes interference easier i don think it would be a benefit to the game but i dont think it would break anything either 2 are you talking on the ship end of things or on the pos end of things3 upgrades to get local back hmm thats kind of interesting it would make being in less active systems much more dangerous and wouldnt really change populated systems i think the idea has merit
if you go full darkside youll get my votes back if i wanted to vote for nerfs theres tons of options if i want to vote for a violent and dangerous high sec currently there is sabriz
that is key npc corp taxes sb increased to 50 these new bastardized social corps a rate of 25 with only full corps allowing the setting of rates by the ceo then you are really incentivizing people towards real corps and not using npc or socials as a tax  war dodgecombine the above with having decs follow someone who drops from a full corp and you are really cookingf
seriously dude ccp doesnt need any help or cover from our socalled protectorofthesandbox csms to slit content creators throats in the pursuit of moar subz we need gandalf on the fcking bridge saying you shall not pass each time a mechanics change is suggested that decreases nonconsensual conflict opportunities in evesadly yes many players and bearcsms have just lost the fucking plot and are swooing at the sirensong of moar subs leading eve towards the rocksbe that gandalf toraf
i care for the wellbeing of eve as a whole thatUFFFDs why corbex gets my vote
hoping sabriz blasts you and your ideas from this thread and in so doing validates our faith in him as a candidate to hold the line on eves founding htfu traditionspsthis is all you need to survive wardecs carebear proffed pansification changes to actual game mechanics are not required or wantedf
it should also be noted that as it is a game often what you say and what you actually believe are very different things
what a  joke people like you are the reason i initially discounted sabrizthe list that you linked gives great advice such as have a second account and dont play the game classicbeyond that the only thing youre encouraging people to do in that joke of a list is evade and survive rather than fight resist and thrive you wouldnt be singing such a pretty tune if the playstyle that you didnt enjoy participating in could be forced upon you just as easily htfu indeed wow such compelling gameplay this raises issues with both current corporation mechanicsand the necessity for a second account code has 300 members marmite has 150 hardly practical and still recommended in order to avoid conflict
re the first question firstly all corporations are involved in pvp all the time even if they arent involved in starship combat running missions for the sisters of eve turning your loyalty points into sisters probes selling them on the market and using that isk to buy a kronos deadspace modules and a plex is a form of realloss pvp in which the winners are the explorers that looted those deadspace modules end users of sisters probes and the kronos manufacturer and the losers are other holders of sisters lps and other net users of plexthe winners and losers in this case gain or lose more than those involved in a tech 1 battlecruiser 1v1 fight or a catalyst ganking a covetorbut lets focus solely on starship combat pvp and corporations that do not specialise in it as i assume this is what you meanthe defenders have considerable advantages in a war mostly the ability to source allies if your corporation feels completely outmatched you have the ability to source outside help i have seen this done effectively to me in the past  after i declared war against a mining corporation they brought in competent mercenaries that scored two or three kills against me and totally neutralized my ability to project force into their systemin addition the defenders have the ability to reship unless they are a dedicated mining alt even the most mining centered of characters usually has the ability to fly tech 1 frigates acceptably well and a swarm of t1 frigates and destroyers is extremely effective if led with even a shred of competencewhat is needed for the defenders isnt rule changes that favor them the present system does that to a significant but balanced degree what they need is advice as to how to resist effectivelyre the second question and strategic objective focused wardecswere it to be an isolated change a restricted wardec would be an interesting mechanic however i have no faith that a strategic objective focused wardec could be implemented in a way that wasnt simply about reducing conflict overallre the third question money is the universal equivalent  something you can trade for the time of other people wardeccers and other starship combat pvp focused players need to support their actions somehow i support mine primarily through trading and tech 2 production ive sold 43 lachesis hulls since the patch for instance even if some change to this effect was made and i do not support such a change id get around it by paying useful idiots sorry people who do not value their time to do it for me much the same as i pay useful idiots to do all of my forprofit and alliance logistics related hauling just as a corp can currently outsource its starship combat pvp to mercenaries
his advice which is good is to stop carrying out activities where you are easy prey you can still carry out those activities with a red in system ive run missions to fix my sec status with public killrights against me so basically everyone in the system is a war target but with extreme careas soon as the red appears in local put the battleship away immediately and run the mission in an agile ship that can escape  a heavy assault cruiser or strategic cruiser or alternately if you cant fly those or arent experienced with them do it in a tech 2 fitted insured tech 1 battlecruiser hull where any loss wont hurt and watch dscan like a hawkwant to mine downship to a venture you are now extremely tough to catch and kill and if you do get popped so what let them kill you twice then make the third time a trapthe add aggressors to watchlist advice is for outofcorp alts eve is a game where alts help a lot but they are not needed
good answers even if you were on the csm yourself anyways follow up question if it is as you say and wars favour the defender why have we not seen any incursion based corporations or alliances that operate specifically in highsec these individuals are likely the most educated in pvp or at least the ingame combat system and yet we still see them operating out of chat channels and solo or npc corps to avoid warsthe following question assumes that creating highsec based nonpvp corporations is a good thing regardless of your opinionwhat changes to the corporation mechanic and wardec system specifically the hiring of mercenaries would have to change in order to make it worthwhile for these groups to actually forms corporations and alliances despite the threat of wardecs
its because the theorycrafters behind the incursion community have recognised that given their goal of maximizing isk per hour the game theoretically correct decision is to be in npc corps or singleplayer corps with no alliance affiliation they are correct a conflictready incursion corporation makes less isk per hour operating in highsec lowsec or nonsov nullsec than a conflictaverse atomized incursion fleet makes operating in highseci would seek to change that equation so that both conflictready and conflictaverse play are possible and conflictready play is the more lucrative optionconcrete suggestions follow you will notice that these all focus on the rewards side of incursions as presently incursion runners have plenty of tools to protect themselves militarily they simply elect not to use them move most of the liquid isk rewards for incursions out of highsec keep the lp in highsec and increase them to partially compensate change the npc tax mechanics so that the tax paid is lower for pve dabblers eg a newbie running level 3 missions inefficiently and higher for career pve players eg a veteran blitzing l4s or incursions provide better rewards for incursions in dangerous space 50 more is not enough when the nature of the space makes fielding expensive ships a poor idea provide rewards where longstanding corp membership in a corp that specialises in incursions is rewarded with increased lp payouts i have ideas for this for missions and mining for incursions id need to pick a few peoples brains
furthermore i feel like you are constructing a strawman to some extentthe way you talk about wars sounds like an idealized version of how i see them as currently existing in the eve meta youre mainly discussing using the wardec system as a tool for conducting nonspaceship pvp which i completely agree is both a valid playstyle and a necessity for competition in highsec my concerns regarding the current state of highsec wars and pvp is the prevailing trend for wardecs to be used as a broad brush to farm kills from new players and the otherwise uninformed none of the ulterior motives such as market pvp or disrupting the logistics of a hostile corporation are present the only motivation that exists is simply to kill anyone who dares use a trade hub or a pipeline system the marmite collective currently has 1300 active wars and 95 of all their kills occur in either a trade hub madirmilire or uedama thats not a guess i checkedtargeted aggression in highsec is fine  more than fine its awesome but a blanket license to prevent 1300 different corporations simultaneously from using trade hubs or even travelis this something that you think is okay how would mercenaries be able to help a corporation in this situation
good suggestions and made with an intent i can support 1
everyone in eve is guilty and they should all be shot and podded
i call bull  cant remember we ever had 1300 active wars
i get that this is tongueincheek but it really does highlight a misperception the hardcore carebear has to the game wardeccers are forced to play the pveindustry playstyle by definition they need to interact with the economy to acquire the ships and resources to pay for the wardec if they only pvped they would quickly be reduced to shooting each other in unfit rookie ships as their combat tools were lost pvp needs pveindustry and pveindustry needs pvp or their would be no point to gathering resources and making ships if there was only peace in new eden so why should players get to decide to opt out of this interrelationship because it is not their playstyle pvpers have to indulge in pveindustry or find someone to do that for them so why should industrial corps not be forced to as well if you dont want to fight the mechanics are highly slanted in your favour and you can find someone to fight for you either by diplomacy or straight out isk and join you as an ally i am not claiming wars are perfect but this idea they are done for griefing or infringing on some right to be left alone needs to be stomped out eve is a competitive sandbox game and corporations are one of the basic units of this competition if you are going to gather resources or engage in industry that competes with my operation you need to be vulnerable to me and others even if you want to be left alone that is just a reality of the sandboxi do think there is room for a corporation that would could optout of this  the socalled social corp being able to tune your risk is something that could be done better in this game so a social corp that is immune to wardecs just like the npc corp but has all the restrictions of the current npc corp is something that should be in the game this would allow a group a friends who just want to have some fun shooting crosses or mining together to do so in relative safety while leaving the wardecs to the corps that are in actual economic competition with each other
eh i didnt check in game just referenced dotlan briefly
may i ask how wars favor defenders currently last i saw more than 80 of all wars have been won by the attacker if a defender cant fight which most cant which is why they are targeted they can refused to undock or they can disband corp or they can try to play and not get killed ccp implemented the ability to hire allies which is usually just a group who has no intention of fighting for you once paid or an alt corp of the attacker thats the only way i can think of it being in favor of the defender
industrial corps are forced into pvp people are constantly told that everything in eve is pvp when you are on the market its against another player when you are making things your competing with another player when you are mining your mining in competition with another playerwith pvp only players they focus on pvp and brush against the edge of pve buying from the market and supplementing their income where they desire a pve only players does the opposite they focus on pve and brush into pvp when they compete on the market or try to secure contracts the problem a lot of pve players is that the pvp player can then force them to engage in combat forcing the pve player to either stop playing on play the way the pvp player plays so why shouldnt the pve player be able to force the pvp player to either stop playing or play the way they playim not saying this is actually something that should be put in but i do understand the frustration they feel from have someone else decide to change their playstyle for a small fee
you seem to maybe be missing the point this is a competitive sandbox game where we compete with each other on multiple levels both direct pvp ship combat economic pvp and while doing industrypve you cannot separate the two in this sandbox game pvp players need ships to be effective at their wardecs which they can buy from the market but they do need isk from somewhere but by doing that they are paying another player to do the pve and industry for them while it may be true that it is harder to buy pvp defense from the market a pve player can do the exact same thing hire mercenaries to defend their operations allowing players to compete in complete safety from other players breaks many thingsyou can only pve and do industry in this game but like a pvper who has to find someone to hire him or give him ships because he dislikes pveindustry you better make arrangements for other players to provide your defense join a balanced corp make an arrangement with a pvp corp some of your industry for a guaranteed ally in a wardec or hire mercenaries but you are at risk in new eden and you cannot abdicate your defense because it is not your playstyle well you can but then dont complain when you are a constant target for your competitors who have arranged their defenses properly and have you and your undefended organization in their sights that is just the nature of the gamebut i agree with you industrial corps are forced to pvp but this is a pvp game if you want the rewards that come from outcompeting other players in the sandbox you have to accept that these other players might want to stop you i could see how this might be frustrating to players that dont understand this but that really is how eve has been designednow that all said wardec mechanics arent even close to perfect sabriz has some good ideas that could make wars more entertaining for both sides
seriously sabriz im sure if more than able to answer on his own or do you feel that he isnt and so you have to help him ive noticed you answering alot of stuff addressed to him is there a problem that you feel sabriz cant answer himself
not at all although he is probably sleeping now plaan jaynara responded directly to my comment on a question from yesterday one that sabriz had already had his say on so i felt it appropriate to give her the courtesy of a response i am sure if sabriz has something to add or to disagree with me on he will when he wakes up but he has indicated previously in this thread he is fine with using this thread to discuss issues related to his csm platform
im not separating the two im asking why on one side a player can force another player to either stop playing or engage in combat while the other side cant as you rightly show you can buy a wardec a wardec is bought from an npc to allow a group of fighters to attack a group of industrialists why then does a group of industrialists have to pay a different group of fighters if they want to fight back surely either the industrialists should have an npc to buy a you cant attack people for a week permit from or the fighters should have to pay a group of industrialists for the ability to fight another set of industrialists which they may or may not come through forwhen i said that i meant it as in the pve they do is pvp this game is all about pvp but it isnt all about combat pvp players only have to touch on the industrial side industrialists only have to touch on the combat side unless of course the combat side decides they want to go after an industrialist at which point the industrialist has to combat  either himself or via a third party  or stop playingim on neither side of this i just understand why people are frustrated by this system adding a peace dec is clearly a silly idea but it raises a good point about why somebody who chooses combat should be able to pay an npc to force a industrialist into hiding or fighting while an industrialist has no method of returning the favor perhaps industrial ships should be significantly better at defending themselves gate and station guns should be buffed to the nuts and concord should only defend certain players to protect newer players removing the need to pay for wardecs altogether stations would not want fighting on their doorstep so theyd make sure to take care of that but out in a belt or a mission site youre as strong as your group
i see what you are saying but this discrepancy stems for the fact that corporations are the basic unit of competition in a pvp game you are right that this means that all competitive corporations can be forced to engage in ship pvp or hire someone to protect their corp the wardec really is just the lubricant for allowing the underlying conflict to take place you cannot opt out of this competition because it is the very nature of the sandbox as for buying your way out of a wardec it is probably not a mechanic because it is essentially isktanking and would favour richer more established corporations if you read the last wardec devblog you can that the last changes were intended for you to spend that money not on bribes to concord but on mercenaries perhaps sabriz has a different view but i think a counterbribe is not a good idea however clearly the last changes didnt work out as well team super friends had hoped of course you are right  there is much more to this game than ship combat however just like the pvp player has to deal with industry somehow the industrialist has to deal with his competitors wanting to blow up his operations somehow that is the game clearly there could be mechanisms introduced into the game to facilitate industrialists finding allies to help defend them or i would support mechanisms like the social corp that would allow them to continue industrypve without the risk of wardecs but less efficiently than a corp that took on the responsibility of defending themselves from their competitor corps or perhaps sabriz has another idea of how industrial corps could be integrated with pvp corps as was intended by the developers but ultimately industrialists have to be made to understand that the corp that just wardecced you doesnt hate you or want to stop your fun but rather they are just competing with you for power and riches in the sandbox that is new eden i can see that too new players and corps should have some protection from the big boys when they are starting out but that cant last forever especially once they are influencing the greater economy ultimately a single industrialist or a small group of industrialists is going to have a hard time competing with the big boys by themselves highsec is not suppose to be a riskfree place for industry nor a corporations assets immune from the touch of their competitors and this has never been the case in the last 11years of eve if a large number of players think that this is the case then ccp is not doing a good job at setting the expectations for new players at what kind of game this really is i think i have had my say on this issue but i will finish by saying that wardec and corporation reform is a serious issue for the highsec community and one of the reasons why i think sabriz would make an excellent representative because of his deep understanding of these dynamics
if industrial corporations were able to pay in order to be immune to war decs than the only groups wed be able to wardec would be smaller corps who cannot afford to keep paying for such a permit richer industrial alliances would completely immune from war decs at the end of the day the newer players would get preyed on even more and the older richer players even less i think it can be agreed that this is the exact opposite of what would be good for the game
i have no issue with discussions happening on this thread someone may well have an idea that i hadnt thought of that is better than what i would have come up with i was indeed asleep at the time but i broadly agree with pedros answers with the caveat that i do a significant amount of starship and module production and that that is for me a significant part of how i funded ganking when i focused on ganking and now how i fund ships for wardeccing i have nine ishtar build jobs running right now and a lot of invention jobs running and i consider these activities to be realloss pvp every bit as much as i consider last weekends engagements against a war target corp other people who build ishtars are engaged in pvp against me people who produce crystalline carbonide armor plates and photon microprocessors are engaged in pvp alongside mei want to elaborate on the controversial the defenders have the advantage comment i made earlier aggressors have the initiative in wars but defenders have the capacity to escalate in a war and a very important 24 hour warning period aggressors receive only a four hour warning period when the defender calls in an allythis is why my corporation doesnt try to establish and defend a pos despite me alone doing enough production to warrant one if we had a pos and wardecced a mining corporation that didnt want to fight us that corp could then wait until only 2 or 3 of us are online plus maybe one or two of our 10 gank alts in other code corps then reinforce our pos with four hours warningthat said the defenders need to use this advantage which entails engaging in the sandbox negotiating mercenary contracts and a payment structure researching the various mercenaries available to determine which ones offer the most useful services deciding whether a third party is needed and planning elaborate traps with your mercenary alliesindustrial corporations like that earn my respect because they take advantages offered and use them to their fullestas for marmites having 1300 active wars  that would cost them 65 billion isk per week minimum id be stunned if marmites spend more than 10 of that
its a thank you for taking the time to reply doesnt matter if its critical or not i hope we dont live in a word where agreeing only counts
im currently the director for education recruitment and human resources for the brave collective lovingly known as the dept of infernal repairs ive held this post for the last six months or so iUFFFDve gradually added to my portfolio since i took over as the head of education a bit over a year ago im a relatively new player to eve ive been playing for only about two years i joined brave newbies in its infancy and quickly came to love the do and die attitude that we hold dear i also love our spirit of focussing on the new player and being a welcoming and accepting place for all newbies i love this game i love its infinite complexity its difficulty its incomprehensibility i love that its really about people and not about clicking a button over and over again i love that when you play it you can get embroiled in a war that spans the whole galaxy or you can live in a single system a single station even and play it to a great depth of complexity i love that we have ancient characters with millions of skillpoints and thousands of hours of playtime coexisting with one hour newbies who don t know how to undock i love that we have a vibrant community that is alive with interest and culture our own gatherings fan art and fiction and an incredible diversity  with players from all around the world coming together to kill scam support educate entertain and delight each other ive never found anything else like it in my role as the head of the infernal repairs division i have been responsible for more newbies than any other person in the game under my stewardship the brave collective has gone from shitfit destroyers in rahadalon to trading punches with the heaviest hitters in the game i am proud that our education department the brave dojo has become a true force for teaching and education within the game i cannot of course take credit for the hard work of our other leaders of our tutors of the bittervets who sit in our help channel and donate hundreds of hours a day to teaching newbies the error of their ways nor would i want to its our players who make us great  im just trying to herd them towards a common goal however iUFFFDve guided and cajoled threatened and wheedled us into something great and now i want to represent the new player in new eden to the gamebob knows im no expert on the game im pretty terrible i dont know who the major players in the game are i dont know the history i dont know the lore i dont even know what a jita is some sort of minmatar probing frigate right i dont know the best way to nerf an ishtari do know newbies brave and a lot of the other newbie friendly organisations do a fantastic job of attracting new players go sit in a help channel or trawl reddit for a while im willing to bet that within about 5 minutes youll see someone recommending brave as a good place to start in the game i love that  i love that people come to try us as a jumping off point i hate that so many of those players never come back after their trial ends i have the benefit of never kicking inactives so i can see the damage that our failure to capture those newbies has done iUFFFDm sure there are many thousands more whoUFFFDve passed through euni rvb test the goons our new player experience is failing our community i want to change that i want to make it easier to look after new players i want to see a full suite of tools become available to a corp leadership to make it easy to manage newbies i recently gave some feedback to ccp rise and mimic about this very subject my platform is simple push the newbie agenda push the expansion of the game push the retention of newbies push the new player experience keep them coming in keep them interested keep the game alive for you and for me ill ask a million dumb questions every meeting the other csm delegates will get sick of answering them i will not represent a bloc or a faction or a specific interest group other than the newbie i represent the new player and i represent corporations trying to assist them i am engaged in the eve community having visited and presented at my first player gathering at the excellent evedownunder you can see that presentation here i know that brave doesnUFFFDt have a fantastic track record with csm candidates thatUFFFDs a given matias burned with revolutionary zeal but was unable to reconcile his real life obligations with the responsibilities of the csm i have a proven track record of working to accomplish goals and i believe i am up to the challenge iUFFFDm very approachable i listen to advice even if i donUFFFDt always take it iUFFFDm open to new information and hope that iUFFFDll make an excellent representative i ask you for your support

you have my voteyou are one of the persons more dedicated to help without asking anything in return that i have seen in this game newbies not necessarily brave newbies need someone like you on the csm
i read a lot of love in your original post this is good  and helping new players in eve is also a good thing this already gives you 2 in my book but can you tell me where you stand on some of the active topics as war decs ganking sov etc
i cant endorse this enough1and its about freaking time eve community blogger  the eve editorial 
cageli is a super great guy has my vote hell ive been nagginghim torun for ages hell be really highon my ballot
that is my boss without him brave had never no free skillbooks frigates implants pisupport newbro classes travel interceptors he is not only our beloved head of infernal repairs and human rersources rigorous watch dog over classic behaviour respectful alliance culture and corp mails do not send corp mails or cagali will eat your innards with vegemite for breakfast  he is also willing to help every newbie with any question any time thanks for your reliable and continuous commitment for da brave thing and good luck for the 10th csm
i feel inclined to vote against cagali just so he can continue doing the excellent job he does for us in brave but i guess thats a bit selfish p 1
i like your donotreplyall mails theyre very sweetyou get my vote as long as you keep sending those nice mails
thanks for the question i come from brave so i actually love being on the receiving end of wardecs i know a lot of people dont though and i know that newbies are often crushed by wardecs and having all their noobloot blown up in untanked t1 haulers i dont know how id change the wardec dynamic but nothing should remain static forever thats what makes this game great ive flown freighters and been ganked so i feel the pain of your victims having said that i watched one of mine and admire the craftsmanship and professionalism that i saw there id hate to see a loss to the game of that form of gameplay having said that i do feel that there could be a way to add a complimentary style of gameplay maybe adding the ability for a player to act as the police instead of only seemingly encouraging the pirate i dont believe that highsec should be pvp free and i am an advocate of nonconsensual pvp even if it hurts me personallysov being new to the sov game i know that giant prescheduled timerfights are less than optimal id love to see some change there and i see the scope for new players to access sov without the giant blob power of brave or massed and serried ranks of supercapitals more content more empowerment for all of our players
thank you for the support and encouragement corbexx
this man blew everyone away at edu me included and will do a great job hes an awesome guy who needs to be on the csm1eve down under  a community for players in the autz
where do your loyalities lie

good luck cagaliUFFFD we are behind you 7o
1 we need him on the csm
cagaliive been pondering that myself the problem imo is that changing corporationsalliances often involves changing locale and there is no transition period for moving stuff take hero for example if youre not in hero our home region of catch is dangerous if youre in hero hisec is dangerous nailing that transition is tough and beyond the understanding of most newlyrecruited newbrosbest idea ive hashed up is a 3day grace period after joining a new corporation before its wardecs apply to you trick would be making sure people cant exploit it perhaps your previous corporations wardecs still apply to you 3 days after you leave it that would also close up the loophole of members leaving their corp temporarily to avoid a wardec
1this person is straight up crazy insane maybehe actually gets his rocks off helping new people to the game learn what is happening and how everything works
10
about time great to see you running
best of luck
i endorse this product andor service
there are newbies who make it in eve and newbies who dont without this man brave would be full of unsubbed accounts of newbies who did not make it he is a champion of the newbie and is directly responsible for countless success stories of newbies who learned enough about eve to love it plus he has a sexy voice you got this dude 69
bni will vote brigade for cagali this is 100 certainthis guy has done more for newbies than anyone in the gamecool guy pretty handsome toogood luck on the csm bb

1when i look back at all the things the brave dojo has accomplished in the last two years im quite stunned what started as a chat channel with idiots helping idiots has grown into an institution some hehe are even copying this institution in homag
1 the dojo is why i am still playing this game 6months  in after years of trying to get started in eve
10
1 for surethe dojo is one of the best resources that ive encountered in any online game no longer do i have to googlefu and hope that the article from four years ago about a semiobscure topic hasnt been changed newbies helping newbies sounds like

cagali is one of the most genuine people ive ever met what he says in his post is the real dealplayer retention is probably eves greatest failing and if anyone can sort it out without ruining the parts of eve that make it great its cagali

another 00 representative this time with even less of a clue than usual yay
fully behind him definitely at the top of my ballot1
good luck cagi i think you will do a fine job
1 cagali stands for the newbie in all of usif only cagali has been there when i tried eve the 1st and 2nd timesthankfully i found bni and the amazing cagali the third timethis man and his plans will be one of the best revenue earners for this game  l
1 you sexy man you
in sorry you feel that way  because i dont represent 00 i represent newbies high low null and wi must disagree with you that im clueless i may not be the most knowledgeable candidate but i get by thanks for the effort it took to reply edit because i actually do represent newbies
so cagali how are you going to differentiate from matias as a guy with a lot of stuff other than eve going on who gets elected and then doesnt do anything on the csm because right now i cant justify voting for you
1 got my vote
sugar is a good csm member really seems to represent the player base as a whole and low sec specifically very well sugar will be on my short list for csm x
i like what you are saying and i completely agree if elected would you pursue this platform within csm x is there anyone within the previous csm which you would see yourself working with on the subject
good to hear this so this means you fully support the marmite collective in the way they play their game too you know with all the wars and not nerfing eve to death you will be the last one i would vote for i think you are a trojan nerf horse in disguise the csm isnt just about you or your npsi fleets its about what the community wants
trojan nerf horse thats one i havent heard before and i rather like it thanksto the point tho im not hiding my dislike for the current wardec mechanics  ive always openly disliked them there are many many things you could do to the mechanic in order to make it more targeted instead of encouraging blanket wardecs as well as just camping in both trade hubs and pipeline systems currently wars serve to both discourage new players from joining a corporation discourages those corporations from ever forming in the first place and doesnt provide enough options for a defending group to fight back in a meaningful waywars are great for hunting down specific individuals or groups preventing a group from operating in a specific area removing structures such as poss and pocos and allowing for large fights between groups such as mercs and rvb etcthese are the facets that should be improved and focused uponin context of your original quote i do support your way to play the game but from a moral or ethical standpoint only i do not support your playstyle in the same way that i couldnt support the decshield initiative for one example of many sure it was possible for that playstyle to occur under the old wardec mechanics but im sure you of all people will agree that using the games mechanics in such a way was broken and needed to be fixed thankfully it was heh so true and i never once claimed that i was interested in the csm for a singular purpose buuuuuuuuut since were  slinging anyway i like your statement when it reads like this instead ahh much betterthats the beautiful thing about democracy isnt it if you represent the minority you get a minority say no matter how loud you say it  and you are the minority here make no mistake i will make no concessions in order to appease youwell just have to wait for election day to see what the community truly wantsedit and if the side effect of using the nerf bat here is a better npe the emergence of more player based groups and encouraging meaningful conflict between highsec entities then all i have to say is swing baby swing
htfu eve is realgreat thats exactly what we do make up your mind you agree or you dont youre giving mixed feelings here to your readerslet me guess you play wow  might want to exchange flowers too
tora your aware bringing more new guys in and creating content for them to be excited about actualy gives you more people to pad your kb with right and everyone likes flowers cept jayne as he is a wooden horse of legend anywho a few actual questions for the fearless leader the bowtie masterthe leader of the cultofsash mr jayneyou get on the panel yay go you what would be the first thing you try and push forward to ccp and whywhat is your main reason for wanting to be on the csmwhich ship type or module requires the most urgent overhaul in your mind and whyand a fun onewhich player made eve video in your mind shows off the game bestashurmanlong live npsi
after reading your post tora it seems that you are playing devils advocate unnecessarily  both you and jayne share the goal of encouraging players out of npc corps and into player created ones considering you both come from such vastly different backgrounds within the game low sec fleetcapital pvp as opposed to high sec camping it seems strange that you would look for an adversary in jayne rather than someone you can communicate ideas withyour combined perspectives would likely only lead to positive outcomes  no one person can have all the answers on any issue which is exactly why the csm needs diversityif i was being a cynic i would say that your concerns seem based around the idea that the player groups jayne proposes could be used as a way to dodge the current war dec mechanics in which you obviously have a vested interest so my question to jayne is thushow would you ensure that the player groups you propose would be subject to the harsh realities of eve and not make gentleman like toras position on the jita undock obsolete
speaking of catch what problemsissues with largescale sov combat and older vs younger alliances do you think the recent heropl fights highlighted
nothing the character bazaar and some recruitment couldnt fix
key campaign linksmy csm x platformcapstable interviewjust for crits interviewcampaign manifestoo7 capsuleersten months ago i was a nobody an explorer with an empty wallet and dreams of exploring the galaxy of new edentoday im still a nobody i dont have any political power or connections my corporation is staffed almost entirely by people whose pvp experience could be summed up on a fortune cookie label i spend my nights exploding industrial ships and composing sarcastic evemails when the mood strikes me i post videos of these exploits on youtube for an audience of mediocre sizeso why should you believe i can make a difference in eve ask the 1000 people i have gotten into eve online via referrals ask the 500 retired eve vets who have emailed me to say my antics got them back in the game the 20000 people who have read my exploration and stealth bomber guides the 400 people who have waited weeks and weeks to join wingspan delivery services the dozens of victims who have paid me for killing them those numbers all mean something and they dont mean chance is great those numbers mean there are people out there a lot of people who are ready to believe in eve online some for the first time some after years of bitter cynicism these are people who are excited for the possibilities eve has now not just the dreaminspired promises of ccp and csm candidates these people are inspired by the crazy idea that they dont have to wait for content to happen they can create it they can be it and they can share it with the world including outside of evei share their passion and their optimism i do not come to this forum with a bag of fixes for eve  that is the job of game designers and analysts instead i come to this forum with the promise to be a voice for progress a voice for content a voice for everyone who is ready to dive into the next epoch of eve online with probes launched and torpedoes loadedgive your voice a chance because if theres one thing you know i can do its deliver
i would also like to announce that i am officially coendorsing suzy rc mudstone for csm x suzy was instrumental in my eve development someone who selflessly taught me the ways of nulsec and steered our corporation throught truly tough times whatever reservations you have about me give suzy your serious consideration
i really like your videos and i think what youre doing is great your videos are great simply for the fact that not everything eve pvp related has to be leet pvp so its all very down to earth relateable and most importantly funnyi have to ask what is your platform what issues will you seek to address howbest of luck to you
highdrag podcast 
when i saw the video i did not think it could be true whoever said dreams dont come true is a dirty fing liar1 from me maybe some more
what is your opinion on the nullsec subcap meta being dominated by ishtars and tengus in major fleet fights is this a result of ccp overnerfing certain shiptypes like battleships and battlecruisers or them allowing things like scanning to be easily conducted for better bombing runs what is your opinion of the state of capitals and supercapitals in nullsec warfaresorry for the disjointedness of my questions
nah youre just taking an opportunity to jump on to something tangential to junes candidacy to be plain rude this whole visit thing bears no relevance to this thread focused on junes platform and candidacy if it really rustles your jimmies so badly you can talk about it somewhere else rather than derail this threadthen its incumbent upon that csm to make that concern known if its such a huge deal then they can just get that request for one friend to spend time with another denied they went through the proper channels to see if it was okay they were told it was this whole conversation is just making the involved look vindictive they need to sort this stuff out in privatenow for something relevant to the thread i can give my personal support and endorsement of june after spending much of my roughly two years in this game living around and interacting with her and her associates she has demonstrated to me her knowledge professionalism and genuine care for the game
balance is always a tricky thing to accomplish and players tend to overdo the thing that is optimal because they want to win i think that its unhealthy for the game when there is only one right way to do a fleet fight eg ishtarstengus online whomever has the most wins but its far easier to heap criticism and less easy to actually balance things correctly in general having viable counters for things is helpful and if its impossible to economically counter something then perhaps a nerf is in order or a buff for a potential counter that doesnt currently quite workim waiting to see how the results of the isboxing ban shake out before i make a sweeping statement about bombing runs making doctrines viablenonviable in 2015 things have changed somewhat since 2014 in that department and it takes time for doctrines to adaptasked and answered if you have a more specific question im happy to elaborate
i can vouch that june is highly motivated to help both new players and older players and is if not one of the nicest people in eve she might be anyways is one of the people i would most highly trust to be involved in the csm to stay motivated and ight for what she believes in i cant say im going to vote for her but if you agree with her on the issues you can count on her to fight for what she believes injune what do you think needs to be done if anything to make solo pvp more viable
so if you get re elected to the csm what will you advocate for ways to introduce new players to solo and small gang pvp earlier what would you change if any thing in regards to the way ships are balanced for small gang or solo pvp vs blob warfare
fair enough  i mistakenly thought i had mentioned the input automation issue as well as the other thing i discussed in the dev blog from yesterday in the op but obviously not to be clear from the csm dev blog released by ccp leeloo yesterdaya couple of things that came slightly out of the blue which i wanted resolved have come to me from the player base since i was elected the first was the issue of input automation which i very quickly engaged ccp on with initially limited success i requested a session to discuss this at length at the summer summit and you can read how that particular conversation went in the summit minutes it was clear that this urgently needed addressing so it was fantastic to see ccp clarify what was a previously grey area and to feel i personally played a significant part in thati also wanted to address how ccp devs actively play the game in a very real way after the issue was brought up by a player after all how can a dev balance the demands of a large 00 bloc fc if they canUFFFDt experience said gameplay themselves this is something i pointed at ccp rise and fozzie when they came on crossing zebras a few weeks back and i believe ccp will act on this in the not too distant futurei thought i had mentioned these in my original op in this thread but clearly not  my badto be clear i would need to check logs but i am entirely confident that i was the first person from csm9 to address the input automation issue with ccp early on in our term i pushed for the session to discuss it at the summit and as you can see from the summer summit minutes it was something i pushed on heavily during and after as to being a reporter i definitely consider that part of my job but not all of it as listed above i have achieved real concrete change as well as being a conduit for the player baseas so being a pl candidate i am a candidate standing on the csmx election who flies with pl same as manfred sideous and bobmon
vic let me ask you if you became a csm how soon will you be lobbying to have your alliance space turned into the go to area so you and your alliance mates can just sit on gates and generate content all daybc after reading all of your views concerns and statements it just appears to me that all you want is more people in your space to shoot at
so i have a couple points to touch on in responding to your postno matter what i say some will not be convinced of my intentions simply due to my associations there is literally nothing i can do to win these votes some though will actually judge a candidates merits or lack theroff on her or his platform i would ask that people consider my platform and not immediately jump to grr goons does the candidates line of reasoning rhyme with your own is this someone you could trust to empower your voice and concerns for example there are several candidates focused on hi sec  are they just wanting to improve their private panda hunting reserve and ensure the rules are tilted in their favor as one would guess from labels and associations or do they actually want to make it a more interesting place this is something that you the voter get to decide and use your vote accordingly do i just stand for sov null stuffi have spent perhaps the majority of my time in this game in npc null and or low conflicts here are more engaging and personal to me i will continue to spend the majority of my time in these areas as i find them the most fun no security band or playstyle should have the monopoly on content to that end i want to empower players that make the choice to revel in the chaos and danger that npc nulllow provide compared to the relative safety of sov null i dont want to turn any sov area into a onestop content shop the more different entities you can get into one area the more interesting interactions can happen and you arent going to get that many entities especially hostile ones in the same sov space at least under the current rules in short i want to see low and npc null buffed specifically because you will get more people more unique groups in areas where they can actually colonize and interact rather than populating the relative sterility of the partitioned sov blocks
ive advocated heavily for changes to the highsec corp aggression mechanics which i suppose you might count though also the conceptualization of what might be good or bad for a corporation alliance or coalition in terms of game mechanics depends largely on zoom level and time frame a rising tide lifts all boats and only the shortsighted or the narrow minded advocate for short term advantage at the expense of the games ecosystem as a whole
ive updated my second post with a link to marc scaurus low sec questionnaire also found here
then what do they have jfatigue from
so just using titan bridges and jump bridges within delve if sohave you suggested to people that they use gates for daily travel
indeed i have unfortunatly people are harder to teach and the fatigue system is not the easiest to understand
well with all due respect to you as a major alliance leader holding 00 sov but i feel as the issue isnt the jump fatigue but rather peoples gameplay habits jump fatigue is what is keeping 00 much more divided and conflict driven why would you want to limit that what is too harsh in your mind
in my mind over a days fatigue is too much most fights aside from maybe 12 in the past 2 years are over in under 24 hours stacking the most fatigue at 1 day is more than enough why stop people from wanting to login due to not being able to join any fleet in your alliance for 30 days because you made a mistake and find it hard after that mistake not to wait over and up to a week or more
that sort of fatigue limitation to be quite blunt is what stops the cfc for example from moving all their supers south of fountain one day and moving it all back up to venal the next day on the broad meta aspect of the game this is exactly what is going to make nullsec a much more diverse multifaction animal as opposed to the boring polarized version we had come to know for the past year  if we could have 68 cfcs or n3s or rus coalitions out there the game would be better and thankfully were heading toward that direction your position on the matter not only works 00 on a broad level but against your very own coalition very directly
thank you i really appreciate the supportdomanark cohost clueless space nerds podcast

when i was a lost little lamb in nulsec suzy mudstone was there to help meevery day i saw suzy work hard for the interests not of the ceo or even the corp as an ideal but for the people in the corp suzy put in assbusting to make sure every person was welcome informed included heard and helped running intel running logistics recruitment fleetshell if suzy was not in this game i dont even know if any of my progress in eve would have happened its from suzy i learned what compassionate corp leadership and sharp decision making looked like tldr suzy is good people vote for suzy
ok but under what form every politician wants something good to happen but what will set you apart is the what and how
i will say im not a game designer but i would attempt to draw some of ccps attention to this if afforded the opportunity
some few will know me but most of you will not so i want to introduce myself for youim an ambitious industrialist in highsec who have fun with 3rd party development also its been two years now that i started to play eve because of this i feel near to newbies and their wishes and worries i thinki have done several things in eve like mining missionrunning some pvp stuff some short trips to low and nullsec but my home is highsectrading t2t3 manufacturing in highsec poses and exploration are my focuses so my priorities are focused on the development in this areas of evebesides i developed some tools for me using the great api ccp gave us and working on some public tools for coorporation and industrial management now this includes an andproid app to monitor your industrial and market activities wip so this is a focus for me also i am curious about all the goodies coming with crest the next monthswe had some big changes in the industrial part last year but in my opinion this should be only the beginning ccp is working hard on changes for pos management something we need since yearsall this things and the relationship between them are not that easy to learn for newbiesone of my goals in our corp and besides are to explain them to new players for this i wrote some tutorials my last tutorial i wrote after the industrialchanges explain how to start with manufacturing and invention for examplenew player are a mayor concern of mine especially if they interested in industry and trading things there several ideas i read about to improve the player experiences especially for players that are not that interested in shooting on otherswardecs and ganking are some of the difficulties a industrialist have to deal with i know theyre part of eve and this is a good thing but some of the mechanisms working not that perfect one thing more i want to see changedwith your help and your votes also we can work on all this to improve the player experience for both newbies and veterans and we are able to show that highsec is more than grinding and isk printing and have its viability also ps english is not my first language as you might guessed but this shouldnt be a problem
hello my dear experienced capsuleers i am doudou the newbrointerrupted but your name is  riot interruptedno no lets make this clear my name represents cute cats or other cute things in french i am part of the frenchy invasion currently going on in new eden and that is why you will vote for me if that isnt enough let me share some other good reasons with youas a completely new player many things pop out at me as being problematic or not as accessible as they should be eve is a complex game and i like it that way there is no dumbing down suggestions that will be encouraged through me but heavy simplification is needed especially in the ui area questions you may have why would i vote for you well probably you wont  but wouldnt it be awesome that someone with a fresh look on the game be allowed to share and shape this experiencedo you understand how much time is needed for csm yes as much as we all do ive read up all i could and i will be able to put aside the time needed for this projectwhats in it for me well if you are an experienced player nothing haha that may not be entirely true but i represent new players with their issuesquestionsaspirations the advanced meta is well enough represented its time we get fresh looks into the process areas of interest  ui  missions discovery tools ingame connecting tools rookie pvp highsec goals  less windows better integration of ui and simplicity the game should be complex the ui should be blissfully simple  me i have a few ideas for missions currently the state of generic mission text is outrageous i want ccp to reach out to the community to help replace the looping text you get from simple missions more on this later if you guys want to hear about it  as discussed with sugarkyle eve needs more ways to connect players to different movements newbro roams other players beginner pvp and interesting events i will be pushing for this a lot all new players start in highsec as such that is the only place i can positively impact get ccp to add tools ingame for those already helping out new players what can you expect  blatant honesty i have nothing to hide and always speak my mind a lot of nonsense and good times i play this game to have fun as such i believe all systems should be fun not enough seriousness you can find that elsewhere i have no desire to be boringly serious technical knowledge as a software engineer student i can have technical discussions with ccp i understand what they mean when they say it will take longer than you might think it also means they cant blind me with technical gibberish win win situation where can you find me ingame i hang out in euni a lot they are a great ressource for new players if there is enough demand ill create a channel and update this post you can always mail me inside the client with questionscommentscritics keep it constructive and i will respondthough my twitch channel has been mainly used to stream coding i will be doing qa there if people are actually interested in thistwitchyoutubeif i get elected xd ill create a skype for you i wont create a twitter as i just dont really like that communication system spread the word  final words contact a starting friend tell your beginner corpmates and dont be shy new eden needs noobs we provide a lot of fun for more experienced players even if that is to our demise i would like to thank absolutely everyone who has helped me get into this game from the guys who killed us in a wormhole and then sent us isk to the helpful players in rookiehelp to sugarkyle and greygal for showing me what eve is all about and to that fine lady who gave me soooooo much isk on christmas xd this has been an awesome ride so far and one thing is 100 certain there is no problem with eve community and their attitude towards new playersi am doing this for fun cause someone in euni said i should  lets see how it goes
as someone that regularly roams into provi to find good fights im loving the jump fatigue limitations on jbs it has really improved the fights we get from provibloc
on the other hand proliferation would not be a problem if supers were balanced in line with all of the other ship classes so even docking in supers could be feasible as a part of a very large balancing effort that brings supers into the whole rockpaperscissors thing
supers can already be stored inside a pos there is an anchorable pos structure already in game specifically designed to hold an assembled capital the xlarge smanow the problem is these are very unsecure as many of the corp roles allow corpmates to  with the pos offline the pos remove the fuel from the pos take the super out of the sma etc there is also the logistical difficulty in boarding the super from the xlsma in a manner that doesnt result in you bumping yourself out of the pos
just tell me where to find you and i will remove your bounty from you bring a tissue and flashlight safe flying
haha thanks for the offer but i have no problem with it to be honest i just thought a different system would be better is all haha and a ccp member wrote that hahah that is kinda funnybut 1 small correction their are some innocent players in eve but nobody cares about innocents when you are a demigod haha anyways thanks for all the replies guys gave me some different points of view so thank you
it is a minority campaign most mmos dumb down and make killing easier for financial reasonshowever eve is too pvp centric at some point the power to the aggressors is going to be too weighted then when it hits a tipping point the prey in the game will cascade out bit like how coalitions and alliances cascade collapse  only those will be players leaving the game instead
your ham fisted blunderposting in everyone elses csm threads made me want to come here and check yours for extra entertainment value  you did not disappoint 1110 the csm is in dire need of people like yourself who clearly have no idea how to play eve
thanks for the bump
ill start by saying i know next to nothing about you outside of seeing the animosity goons have for you in the tmc comment sectionso ive read your op and listened to the podcast this is what ive come away with about your platform stv voting system is corruptible  vote buying  system gives advantage to large sovnull blocs csm candidates are allowed to misrepresent themselves need term limits rmting is bad botting is badso it seems pretty safe to say the summation is that you dont like cheating or things that smack of cheatingfrom what little i understand of the day to day process of the csm its mostly ccp coming to the csm with their own ideas and asking the csm what they think about them so they can gauge possible player customer reaction to changes it seems like those ideas are focused on game mechanics and possibly appearance if that is what happens and they dont come to you asking about the csm election process rmting or botting but instead about game mechanics what kind of experience do you have in gameyou seem to take the position that you have no ingame loyalties to any organizations and at the same time youve been in all parts of the game ie whs null fw hisec etc so here are my questionswhat experience do you have in what parts of spacewhat kinds of organizations have you been a part ofhave you held positions of responsibility in said organizations and what were theyare there mechanics youve found through those experiences that youd like to see fixed and what are the fixes youd preferdo you have any theories or preferences on how sovnull mechanics should be changed
can you offer any kind of guarantee that if i were to vote for you that my vote would be more wasted than if i were to simply vote for the leading goon candidate
probably because the very concept is so utterly daft they didnt bother to waste the time to write something
what experience do you have in what parts of spacei have been in every kind of space at least once the area of space where i have the least amount of experience is probably wormholes when i do anything ingame or otherwise and i encounter something t
been in every kind of space once that makes you understand how the system works dumbest thing i have read from you on here yetwhen did you act as a director of hydra reloadedexplain albatross for pizza because honestly it only sounds like a cooler word for scout or tackleri dont think anyone cares about you playing arma 3 with pl because who doesnt incursion i guess thats cool i mean we ran an entire incursion down in less than 16 hours
of course i will start spending my 190k for new accounts today so that i can have them set up for voting time
i had absolutely no intention of voting for you anyway so i cant truly say i am less likely to vote for you now less than zero works in math as negative numbers but in the case of voting unfortunately you cannot receive less than zero votes that said your comment about zarathustra more commonly known as zoroaster really goes to show what sort of person you arezoroasters many teachings are more accurately described as mythology not science unless you have some sort of proof that obesity is really caused by a race of evil humanoids who forcibly interbred with humans and who are living on the inner crust of the earth under the light of the inner sun burning at the center of the earth and who can be found by walking through a cave complex that begins in the balmy center of the garden of eden located at the north pole and ends in the airy temperate center of the earth or that any of his other less plausible teachings are true refrain from calling his teachings scientifici suppose the same magical thinking is what convinced you that all nonvoting players in eve want exactly the same things you want in game and that goons have somehow kept them from voicing their wants and needs coincidentally the assumption that others wantthinkneedfeel what you wantthinkneedfeel is called projectionwhile wikipedia isnt the absolute authority on any give topic this particular article is rather accurate
the sad part is not only are you in goonswarm but you arent agreeing with xenuria which obviously means you just didnt read the op are asking questions already answered to the most impeccable of standards and are just disagreeing to keep your firm grip on the csm away from the silent majoritydont worry xenuria ill post for ya so you dont have to waste time with these adherents to the statusquo
i listened to your interview from capstable there seems to be alot past history with certian members of goons given that would you listen to what a member in goons or the cfc has to stay the feeling i get from listening to you is theres alot of grrrr goonies just because of what a couple of people that we part of that group has done a second question for you do you really feel that in a game that allows scaming cheating stealing and backstabbing that having ccp police yet another aspect of the game is a good thing i am reffering to your call to reform with the csm do you think the players themselves can and do keep everyone in check the current csm 9 is i think an example of the players controlling the csm they all as far as i can tell have done a pretty good job
i would listen to what any player has to say in the context of the csmgoon or not in terms of reform and policing i think that if ccp wanted to reverse their decision of impersonation and misrepresentation than i wouldnt have much of a precedent to stand on that said they likely will not and as such the csm should not be exempt from this policy you make a great deal of assumptions and leaps of logic for somebody so otherwise eloquent by the way the psychological term you are looking for is proteus effect not psychological projection
stopped reading at slot machines with ore points if ppl find mining boring then alt tab and watch a documentary 30 min notification button for afks sounds like something provi ppl would come up with to avoid afk cloakersmaybe i like just sit and look at different locals in provi for 1012 hours at the time stop telling ppl what they cant do and start talking about what the can do eve needs content buffs not nerfs
i agree with you if you read it all you might even vote for me
hey guys my name is bam stroker and i want to represent all of you on csm xtldr i think these go better at the top than the bottom  6 year eve vet organiser of eve down under does a weekly live internet radio show about eve helped to build the autz into an active community that punches well above its weight mastermind behind evemeetcom eve bet marketing duder foamymouthed crazy about getting eve nerds together to foster relationships and generate content friends with literally everyone yes even you iUFFFDm seeking a seat on the csm to use that platform however i can to empower other community builders and special interest groups community community community also communityi rolled my first character in 2004 and spent several years in a cycle of unsubbing and resubbing a few times a year until eve finally UFFFDclickedUFFFD for me 2009 iUFFFDve been playing pretty much daily ever sincesince then my ingame journey has taken me from mining and mission running in hisec to smallgang pvp in syndicate and living in lowend whs to my current home as a line member of an autz corporation in pandemic legion flying in sovbut itUFFFDs the things iUFFFDve done and am passionate about when iUFFFDm not actually undocked which are why iUFFFDm putting myself forward as a candidate for csm because as much as i love this stupid game about internet spaceships the thing that really engages me are the people that i share it withby now the role of the csm and our understanding of it has matured beyond the early days of it naively being treated like some kind of fantastical wishgranting factory ie if you vote for me ill make ccp do x we now all better understand the csmUFFFDs role as a stakeholder in the development process and its limitations that said its reasonable to expect that each candidate brings their own particular priorities to the csm and im no exceptionwith apologies to james carville UFFFDitUFFFDs the community stupidUFFFDmy platformthe engagement and interconnectedness of the community is as important to the long term health of eve as the resist profile of an ihub addressing afk cloaking or the distance a capital ship can jumpingame special interest groups or as iUFFFDll call them UFFFDsocietiesUFFFD are entities that come together around a particular activity interest language location or external social platform these are things like npsi communities incursion communities lore and rping groups players from the same city or timezone forums twitter etcthese societies have a tremendous impact on the game they generate content for players to exploit whether those players are members of the society in question or or just third parties that encounter those groups out in space beyond ingame content these societies foster and maintain relationships that keep players engaged and logging in which feeds back into the generation of contentsocieties are also a boon to the retention of new players providing many of them with a place to get assistance or mentoring and expose them to the wide variety of experiences that eve has to offer which they simply donUFFFDt find out about from the tutorials if new players know they even exist or how to find them that isthe biggest problems facing these societies or wouldbe societies right now are a lack of robust administration tools and a complete lack of discoverability within the clientmeanwhile reallife player gatherings are an extension of these ingame societies into the real world and they are an enormous amount of fun and incredibly powerful in solidifying bonds between players as someone who has either organised or supported countless player gatherings ranging from small pub meetups to major multiday events iUFFFDm acutely aware of the challenges faced by people trying to get an endeavor like that off the groundcommunity often gets overlooked in csm campaigns though because the burning issues that many players are seeking attention for relate to highprofile single issue mechanics or balance problems eg fixing sov ishtarsthe csm shouldnUFFFDt be so myopic though although those other issues are important remember that csm x will have 14 members even if you donUFFFDt get out of bed to vote thereUFFFDll still be predictable mix of representatives from nullsec lowsec hisec and whs as well as a couple with special interests like the new player experience or thirdparty toolsbut i need your support to bring a dedicated community focus to the council iUFFFDll put community first and will look at matters brought before the csm through the prism of how the community will be affected and advocate for anything practical that will improve the experience of community builders like myself which in turn will benefit eve players at largei want more of these societies to emerge grow and thrive so that more players  whether youUFFFDre actually involved in a society or not  can benefit from the friendships and content that they provide if you see the value in that too then i humbly ask for your vote in the upcoming electioneve down under  a community for players in the autz
why iUFFFDm running nowi had previously considered running for both csm 8 and 9 in the end i deferred and decided that i wouldnUFFFDt put my hand up until i felt like i had something to offer the csm that nobody else could i hadnUFFFDt intended to run this year either but then mangala solaris messed that upi had read many of the things heUFFFDd posted calling for support for special interest groups in eve and i spoke to him at length about it at eve vegas mang and i shared many common ideas and concerns for community support and it seemed to me he was the guy to carry it forward in the csm i could rest easybut when i found out he wouldnUFFFDt be seeking reelection for csm i knew that i wouldnUFFFDt be able to just relax and let someone else take care of all the work  i had to put my hand up if i wanted to see this important agenda advanced to ccp and so here i amwhat iUFFFDll bring to the csmin real life i work in subnational government specifically UFFFDnonmedia communicationsUFFFD note the UFFFDnonUFFFD part before media  iUFFFDm not a spin doctor my job is to articulate and disseminate information to a large body of people and efficiently process the feedback iUFFFDm also used to working in small teams that require frequent and clear internal communication i can think of few irl jobs that would have as much relevance to a body like the csm in addition to my irl skill set my involvement with eve down under has put me in regular contact with ccp i have established relationships with many of the developers and already have a respectable understanding of the structure and culture of the company i have also followed the csm closely for several years and i donUFFFDt expect it to be some kind of special snowflake social club in fact i anticipate there will a great deal of frustration that accompanies the role but iUFFFDm prepared for that and will do my utmost to deal with everyone involved  ccp other members of the council and the players  with grace and respecteve consumes a lot of my free time and i actually like it that way iUFFFDve kept up a constant pace for the last couple of years organising eve down under handling our social media attending player gatherings doing a weekly internet radio show playing the game itself and working on numerous side projects people can vote for me with confidence that iUFFFDm not going to give up and go afk or burn out since if that were going to happen it would have already happened well before nowany organisation ive been involved with has been left better off than when i found it i have a thick skin play well with others and theres no task  no matter how small or mundane  that im too proud to put time and effort into i will be a hard working accessible and reliable member of the csm  qualities i have already demonstrated many times through the myriad other projects ive been involved with in evesome things iUFFFDve doneeve down under  organiser of what was the largest

i also spearheaded the effort to get this segment produced and on the airin conclusionstorytime i was at a player gathering in melbourne late last year it was a big event with about 40 people in attendance and i got talking to a player who i hadnUFFFDt met before during the the course of our conversation he told me that a few weeks earlier he had cancelled his subs and was just running down the clock because his corp had gone afk and heUFFFDd grown bored by chance he found out about the meetup while browsing the eveo forums and decided he might as well come alonghe went on to tell me that heUFFFDd just met some guys from a corp that sounded fun and was going to go home resub and apply to their corp his story was one of the main inspirations that spurred me to create evemeetnet to enhance the discoverability of irl player gatheringsin some respects the community also functions as a kind of lifeboat providing that extra incentive to encourage people to stick with eve even when someoneUFFFDs going through a rocky phase its importance cannot be understated and it deserves the attention of at least one csm who is committed to it fulltimeiUFFFDll do my best to answer questions

definitely got a spot on my ballot the social aspect of eve is what keeps people coming back and the more tools we have to enrich and expand that the better
first of all thanks for your endorsement it means a lot i know you and i in some regards are competing for a similar type of voter so its particularly gracious of you to give itand yes im now the third member of pl to campaign for csm but i am by no means running as a pl candidate official or otherwise i havent discussed my plans to run with manny xander or anyone in pl leadership within pl itself im not what youd regard as a well known personality anywaythats not to say i wouldnt welcome the support of anyone in pl who wanted to give it by way of endorsement or votes but for me to present myself to pl and say im your guy would be a conceit because the priorities that big bloc sov candidates usually carry forward are quite different from mineedit woops im actually the fourth  sorry bobmoneve down under  a community for players in the autz
i am delighted to see bam running he pulled me aside to chat at eve vegas about the csm and what he can do and bring to the table his seriousness in making the decision was commendable and his dedication passion and energy for eve the game and eve the community are inspiring
bam was member 2 of the adelaide crew some time circa 2009 to date he has been a core member in building two eve communities adelaide crew and eve down under from absolutely buttfuck nothing into active and open crosscoalition and crossgameplay groups with strong communication channels and regular meetups to date no one has been bottled in the face1110 would buy a beer at fanfestwas recently involved in saving a budgerigars life
ive known bam for about 3 years now since he piped up in the australian eve community and was a massive help running eve down under and next to rdnx is one of the key guys who has made the eve down under community into what it is todaythere is no better person that i have met in my 6 years of playing eve that i would love to see in the csm than bam eve down under  australian eve community wwwevedownundercom
ive only been playing since 2013 but in that time there have been few people i have heard spoken of with respect to the extent bam ishe was just plotting his move from the corp i am in to sov when i joined but to this day he is spoken of with respect within our corp and even within syndicate as a whole the work he puts in to connecting and building the autz community is characteristic of the person behind the character and i feel he would be an asset to both ccp and the csm should he be successful in achieving csm 10

you have my vote
well that was quite a good op youve earned yourself a highish spot on my slate
big 1 to this man who works tirelessly for the autz as a whole and not just his corporationalliance would represent aussies proud on the csm
hello some of you might remember me from such og events such as edu 2015 where i along side by good friend dark razer gave a sterling presentation on leadership in eve using as many double entendre as possibleive had the pleasure of knowing bam for a while now and this is not unexpected but welcomedhe introduced himself at the first meet i went to in adelaide where a few weird blokes met at a pub in midday suddenly were best mates and ended up sharing oysters kilpatrick late into the night since then ive known him to be a paragon of the autz communitythe reasons he is getting my votehe spends a considerable amount of time already organizing events for players both in game and out he strives to bring ccp into reach of the common player giving advice passing concerns and where possible sharing contacts he always takes time out to talk to new players he understands the issues coming out of almost every aspect of the game he isnt an expert but he has put in the effort to know enough to understand when people are annoyed or glad finally he doesnt care what corp  alliance  sec  style  affiliation  age  experience you have to him any player is worth listening to and addressing their concerns he has my full support in this electionbam4csmrenton braxedit so it didt sound like i was pleasuring bam
huge 1 he is all about the community i believe he did or attempted to attend casual eve meets around australia if you know the geographical size of australa that is no easy feet i know he attended the last brisbane eve meethe has put a lot of work into the australian eve community not only helping hostimprove on the eve downunder event that is held annually alongside of
i have worked closely with bam on various project and definitely a big 1 from mehis tireless energy and infectious enthusiasm along with his keenness to provide sensible  meaningful feedback to ccp makes him an ideal candidate for csmrdeve down under  wwwevedownundercom  autz  best tz
as someone that enjoyed devoting a good amount of his time helping develop and promote npsi im glad to see someone on the ballot that can champion similar concepts an nspi candidate with an actual platform is both refreshing and unique1
bam stroker is the most broy bro that i know last year he travelled to pretty much every major meet in australia just so he could meet more nerdz tirelessly helping out with edu and being that guy who will be like yep i can do that as the official host of the eve down under show 1 bam strokerhowever i also have a questio for you although evemeetnet is amazing how do you think that we can further engage players to build the communitiesfriendships and increase player retentionit is much easier in my mind to get two vets who have shot at each other forever into a rl meet than it is to get a 2 week newbie to rock up to something out of game with people they havent metanyway bam stoker 1
bams a great chap worked stupidly hard during edu 2014 while the rest of his corp were getting drunk around him thats some dedication1
not that my opinion is worth much in the scheme of things but ive known bam for the best part of 20 years i still quite fondly recall the excitement i felt when he first showed me eve i couldnt get home fast enough to sign up while i havent devoted as much time or energy to the game as bam i think it is fair to say there are few that have we live in different states now but that doesnt mean much in the internet of things we recently arranged for a group of us to attend pax au together it was something of a reunion of sorts half a dozen long time friends from all corners of he country celebrating nerdhood together it took about five minutes for bam to ditch us all for an eve meet thats how committed he is to the game and the community this isnt to say he ditched us completely of course there were many ensuing shenanigans we didnt mind his eve fervor  thats just bam a top bloke whos never let us down and wont let you down either
more than four years ago i began playing evefast forward 1218 months and i joined the same corp as one bam strokerhe mentored me in all aspects of internet space vessels he showed me all the aspects this game has to offer and showed just how immersive and amazing eve can be because of the people that you fly with the communityi have forever held him in the highest of regards and would even call him friend after drinking many many beers with this fine gentlemani can only reiterate those statements already made this man is one of a kind enthusiastic passionate hard working well spoken intelligent easy going the list goes onhe is the man that all of you want and need on csmhe is the man that will do his own personal best in everything he strives for and then try and achieve morehe is the man that you all need to vote 1 forbam stroker your most important csm vote
1 bam is a good man and does alot for the autz communitybam4csm
yey for community obam has my vote for sure

what can be done to manage expectations of safety in highsec
now that is an excellent question
thanks for the question bisu im glad you ask as much as i respect matias vision he was utterly unable to reconcile his rl worklife and eve balance ive been active in the brave community for two years straight i hope i can convince you of that
i met this gentleman at eve down under 2014 and think he will make a great representative on the csm1rdeve down under  wwwevedownundercom  autz  best tz
cagali is one of those people i truly call friend in eve go get them you have my vote

taking this seriously rather than as a jokefirst and foremost csm loyalties should be to eve the game the entire community it is why i am taking the stupid approach and not making an active effort to drum up support within my coalition thread here a link to someone complaining about something i address yes but i am not spamming or mailing away like crazy or anything in other words natural discussion because of where i am trying to reach out to everyone a complete cross section of eve example mailing a tiny 6 man corps that were ganked in 08 systems and such very futile they probably quit after thatthat people are getting in simply because they are being put forward as representatives of alliances and coalitions concerns me greatly
not to be an ass but a small corps need for representation is neither equal to nor more important than the right for a massive coalition to have csm representation thats representation by population and its democratic furthermore simply by being associated with an alliance or coalition does not invalidate your own credentials nor does it hinder your ability to represent players on the csm weve seen some of the best csm members in recent history hail from these coalitionstldr  check yourself
sending a vote your way
i agree more players sounds like a good thing but not while you are killing eve its like saying  if cars would just drive half their speed we would have less accidents this is true but you also just  up the entire fun of driving one this is what a lot of csm do not see yet they want to nerf eve to death and make this some flower exchange program happy thoughts o boring what i also do not like about people is when they say two things at the same time that makes you untrustworthy i rather have a csm who says a because he believes in a even if i hate a i at least know where i stand people like jayne will say anything to make you happy and do anything they feel like true but the way i want it will cause less damage to the roots of eve
and yet you being unhappy with my opinion flies in direct opposition to what you just said im not going to sugar coat my opinions and never have im going to do whatever i feel is right regardless of whether or not it makes you happy  especially youto the others who asked me questions i havent ignored you im just waiting until i have the time to properly respond
no it doesnt you just dont like to get caught with your pants down my advice have an opinion tell the community and stick with it
honestly i dont even know what youre trying to say anymore anyway if you dont have another question for me then im going to ask you to stick to your own threadyou dont like me fine youre not going to vote for me thats cool too good luck on your campaign
thats a tough one to answer because i wont know what the csm and ccp are currently working on until i am elected its not my place to demand specific changes that arent in ccps roadmap but to advise on whatever they are trying to design or iterate however the one thing id want to push first and foremost is a little things update to channels and mailing lists simple to make sure the npsi communities actually have a voice on the csm that represents them mangala did a great job but hes not running for reelection and these is still work to be done lots more work to be done ccp is going a great job with the module tiericide so far and id be in favour of them simply carrying on with the direction they are currently travelling specifically id like to see the redundant or simply useless modules removed while the meta levels of modules standardized no more m4  t2 nonsense i have a lot of favorite videos and i actually compiled my list into a video showcase a while ago it can be found here
there are quite a few ways that this could be done but the way i envision it is rather simple these social groups or societies shouldnt be able own anything as a collective no pocos no poss no offices no taxes etc etc the activities to be encouraged should be purely event and social based and have nothing to do with building an empire or competing with other established real corporations
would you ever support an idea for an npsi community to take sov if it was only possible in specific systems designated by ccp i ask because i remember bombers bar jokingly or maybe not trying to take sov in hedgp perhaps spectre did this as well not trying to leave them out
we have tried to take sov before as an npsi group once seriously and since then only in playful wargames i was involved the instigator actually of the hedgp attempt back in my bombers bar days as well as the more recent wargames against providence with spectre fleetin both cases we had zero plan with what wed do with the system other than freeport it if we actually succeededif this were ever to be the case it would have to involve an alliance holding sov in proxy for an npsi community i just dont think there is any place in the mechanics for sov to be blended with noncorporate entities thats not to say i wouldnt love to see an npsiesque freeport regions such as the big blue or phoebe freeport republics more recent efforts but i wouldnt support the ability for npsi groups to take sov nothats not to say those communities wouldnt be in favour of helping groups that desire to freeport sov nullsec as that has already happened and is something that the community is almost universally in support of which is great but nothing more official than that is needed imho some people usually those on the receiving end of these fleets have decried the ability for npsi groups to form a full 250 man fleet as being overpowered and in a sense theyre correct if you want to build an empire join a corp

you got my vote the csm needs people who are able to connect with people and genuinely care about the game
that first question is quite big and a really hard one to answer i think that faction warfare could be a great starting point for people wanting to do small gang pvp and then branch out into doing solo stuff during downtimewhen no one else in your group are online the problem with solo pvp is that it is a isk sink for 99 of all players and people just dont like losing isk this could be offset by doing a fw plex to pay for your ship pretty much i honestly think that the best way and the way most people got into solo pvp was by watching pvp videos like garmonation etc and thinking i can do that i would want ccp to promote good videos better and they are doing a bit better but there are still more to do one thing people need to understand with small gang is that you dont need to instantly jump into the endgame orthrus  machariel  snakes and links small gang fleets just to stay competitive running small cheap gangs such as just a bunch of cruisers with 1 logi or maybe remote rep tristansvexors is a cheap way to get into pvp and a way to cause a lot of damage same thing with solo pvp i really think everyone should do buy 5100 of a ship and t1 fit it  just go out and fight in faction warfare space while you will die a lot you will learn what every ship can do and what your ship can do very well this is a very useful skill that has uses for all types of warfare i dont think you can force people to go out and solo pvp and i dont think most people really care that their pvp is skill intensive or anything its more of a pressing f1  bullshitting with your friends playing a social game i do this sometimes because its relaxing and fun to talk to your friends if someone doesnt want to solo pvp they probably wont go into it with their full hear and maybe go lose a ship and have no fun at all the thing is solo pvp isnt very rewarding most of the times the more experienced you get the more you know what you can and can not attack and this turns roams into endless parts of either no people or people you just cant fight i dont know if it is the bitter vet in me speaking but you turn more risk averse and then miss those fights where you couldnt win on paper just looking at what they have and what you have but when you actually go and do it you find out that they wasnt perfectly skilled with a perfect fit and you actually came out ontop and this is where you really get the rewards of solo pvp killng a bigger fleet or even a single upship kill is so rewarding and you know that it is all youfor small gang pvp its a matter of finding people that you like to fly with if they are in anyway good they can be great with some practiceroaming and actually analyzing fitsbattles or if you are a non casual you could just do a ton of research and study all mechanicsspend time in eft theorycrafting a gang up and have a easier way of getting good i think the new player experience needs to tell people about mechanics that are obvious to older guys but not really explained at all maneuvers such as slingshotting getting under guns manually piloting in combat and how to fly your ship to apply more damage by matching transversal these things are easy to learn if you actually spend the time looking up youtube gudies but they are not really explained ingameso to sum things up i would like ccp to promote solosmall gang pvp videos more tell more people about faction warfare and that you dont need 1b ships to win get people to join a pvp corp that promotes solosmall gang pvp make everyone understand that solo isnt going to be for everyone in a mmo it is a social game after all it is also important that the older guys at least teach something to the new guys and accept that they are new and still learning i will answer the ship balance question tomorrow
i do agree with you to a point high sec has been stagnate and bloated there isnt much to offer new lplayers in the ways of successful caimpaigning in low or null unless they are in big fleets that can mask them but everyone has their own playstyle rather than take away from one to give to another why not just give the more riskier more reward let the carebears be carebears if low or null was more enticing to move there more would do so and the players that stay in high sec become greater targets than before making their riskisk factor go up
i disagree compare and contrast these two scenarios though ill admit they may be idyllically painted due to fond memories of days in barleguetasteve stegosaurus decides to play eve online after hearing so much about it one of the first things he realizes is that he needs isk to do anything but being so new he cant afford to really risk much and begins grinding missions and isk maybe even mining the game of intriguing stories and heated battles seems so foreign but he grinds in good faith that one day you know that one day in the future when he has enough isk and lp he will venture into dangerous areas chances are that day will never come or he will be ganked or wardecced into extinction and never really have a good opportunity to learn the game or enjoy it unless he really just likes missions this is currently what the income and risk structure of the game encouragesbabbie anaconda decides to start playing the game with a few friends or maybe she was fortunate enough to be recruited by an adventurous veteran who wants to see how far he can get managing a new corp life seems rough out in low or npc null compared to steve there arent many ways to get isk and predatory players make surviving a challenge through patience planning and persistence she learns how to stay safe while hunting clone soldiers in groups of frigates in fact she has far more fun with a group of friends hunting for clone soldiers than steve had grinding level 1 and 2 missions alone predatory players have taken notice of these gangs and begin bullying them eventually abbies gang assert their dominance and score a few nice kills using only cheap combined arms frigates against bigger tii ships steve is entirely empty handed when it comes to adventure and stories like this characters and happenings like this are what eve is im sure we all remember that one guy that was the local bully and treasured the times we came out on topmaybe that was a little hokey but the idea is sound more stuff in space that can generate content would be warmly welcomed in both low and npc null new players can contribute a lot and its the best time to learn teamwork
awoxingobviously people have concerns over thisathe tool box of the hi sec antagonist is shrinking its already too small there arent many interesting choices besides suicide ganking this is a bad thing bgiven the state of hi sec and riskreward ratios it is also a step in the entirely wrong direction if low and null were rebalanced so they actually draw numbers this wouldnt be as big of a deal its another step towards optimizing the high sec trap of complete safety and guaranteed income if there were more people living in areas without concord no one would even take a second look about these changes howevercto the best of my knowledge the biggest awoxes have not happened in hi sec it is completely unfair and disingenuous to saw awoxing has been removed hi sec antagonistspirate aspirants who pompously pontificate about riskreward and yet depend on having such a risk free way of ensuring kills should make you think about its usage i understand that the rest of the game is a target poor environment which is why i maintain that fixing other security bands is a real root treatment of several ills plaguing the game  if you want to build a better pirate you must first build them a better new eden
i like your blunt shooting from the hip approach to the reviewedit oh i suppose thati have to add the expected grrr goons otherwise people will report this post  and claim my account was stolen  this was also written in their strata method so they can read it
grr goons
so what you are saying is that you keep misunderstanding others and assuming all your thoughts feelings wants and needs are actually not yours but theirs because they use avatars in eve your inability to fathom the concept that not everyone is your mental and emotional clone is actually the fault of  pixelsinteresting perhaps you can explain how a man who dreamed up a multitude of other races and a home for them at the earths center and how you perceive such obvious mythology as science is the fault of his nonexistent avatar im all ears
that is some spooky stuff does that mean when i meet xenuria he should behave act and look like his avatar if so i would need an adult
i suggest more than one adult
im never going to anything xenuria is that was creepy
actually alexa machavela described psychological projection and you seem to do that a lot the proteus effect has nothing to do with anything that alexa machavela was talking aboutinteresting effect though im glad you brought it up am now reading the wiki page on it and am glad i can now give a name to this effect
i think all the armchair psychologists should stay on topic lest they provide more cringe for actual psychologists
i could have sworn that talking about your csm beliefs and how you project them onto other people was staying on topic i guess you dont like people telling you to stop thinking you know what they want also did you bring up the proteus effect because you are starting to act like the character xenuria instead of the person that plays her on a game
all of that is on you as i said before you are making assumptions without any prompting how you choose to imagine me in your own head cannon is not a subject of import here please try and stay on topic
despicable

ive been around for over a decade and ive met no one more passionate about eve than bam stroker his personable demeanor enthusiasm and overall helluva good dude vibe drives me crazy at times the eve community cannot be represented any better with bam stroker on the csm
wow feeling pretty amped by the outpouring of support and kind words some even elicited feels i wasnt expecting gil and inceptor 3one of if not the biggest issues that faces someone who is trying to build a society is discoverability people cant get involved with these player groups or go to a meetup if they dont know they exist and the instigators have to be very very proactive  some might say aggressively so  if theyre going to succeed at getting the attention of wouldbe participantsan ingame society bazaar would be a great start similar to the corp search tool in the recruitment tab of the corporation window it would serve as a place for people to advertise their society detail their particular area of interest and other relevant information such as language timezone etc add it to the default icons on the neocom or station services button too and direct new players to it as part of the tutorialoutofgame the oceanus release last september brought with it two of the most exciting things ive seen added to eve in years the new notifications beta and the beta optin feature itself most people probably didnt get all that hot and sweaty about them but i saw some great potential thereccp knows where we all live theyve got our info in their accounts database their billing system and they see our ip whenever we log in how amazing would it be if i could notify ccp that i was organising a player gathering and have an ingame notification pushed to all players who lived within say 100km of where it was taking place i think engagement would skyrocket make it optout rather than optin toothere are some issues that present themselves of course people would find some reason to be mad that they got the notification in the first place but afterwards they can optout and not be notified again theres the potential for people to make troll events and there might even be some legal liabilities that ccp face if something bad goes down at a meetup which they helped promote even if they didnt organise themselves they already promote playerrun gatherings of course but maybe there are different implications if they move those endorsements inclient i dont think any of those are truly insurmountable with careful planning and implementation thoughif this all sounds familiar its because this train of thought is basically what led me to come up with evemeetnet which has been really well received however nothing would make me happier than if that site became completely redundant because ccp replicated its functionality in the client where it would be so much more powerfulobtaining the dev resources to make things like these would be the biggest challenge i should think and by now we pretty much all realise that nothing is ever as straightforward as it seems given eves tendency to roadblock progress if a project needs to touch on ancient arcane spaghetti code
bam for csm xas a player that runs meets i know how hard it is to get the voice heardthe time is now right for a community csm who represents community needs and values yes its all fine and well for nullwhlohi to have there csm members what about when you step away from the clientthat last post bam that should be what you try and get done for this time next year yes it will take time but nobody puts a road down without making plans and getting around bumps on the way now my meets are at the smaller end of the scale but its been built on a solid foundation a good number of players know about the glasgow eve meets but there are still a lot that have never herd about this can be said for every meet things are getting better but this is the time were those that like a drink and a chat face to face leave the keyboard behind
you can find my quizzing by just for crits here
this is too big a question to fully answer in one post especially a post made on a tablet apologies for typosas i see it there are three main reasons people suffer really really dumb losses in highsec1  a newish player in their first experience with the sandbox2  a belief that highsec is safer than it actually is and in particular a belief that the most dangerous systems in high are safer thanthe lleast dangerous systems in low3  a calculation of risk vs reward that says yes losing a dominix in a mission is cheaper than losing a kronos but the extra isk per hour is worth the risk this calculation may be correct or it may be wrongre 1 i think tutorials that are low stakes but competitive are the way to go here have a tutorial mission that sends a rookie to deliver a package to an area of space that is probeable and to sit there for two minutes then have a latter tutorial to probe down and steal that very package from another player consequences of failure should be minimal and the rewards of a successful theft high enough that collusion would be the game theoretical correct choice that will introduce rookies to the sandbox early with minimal consequences and get them used to the idea that highsec is not safere 2 this needs both out of game communication along with more chaos in highsec in general the other factor is that most rookies first experience with low is usually to walk into a gate camp because the most obvious entrances into low are much more dangerous than other entrances this makes people think low is orders of magnitude more dangerous than high when in fact it is not exception of tama egghelende and a couple othersre 3  attempting to make an informed riskreward decision is playing eve properly sometimes you make the decision wrongly sometimes you make the highest ev choice but still lose thats finethere is more to say on this issue but not on a touch screen

i strongly support anything that gives alternative for ship spinningif i have understood correctly nex store was suppose to replace eve store this was probably reason why they tried to sell overpriced monocles no one was thinking that eve store and nex store could coexist with each other both bringing in cash to eve development later they closed eve store and reopened it with old items gone and with few new items
i proposed recently that bowhead could get jump drives with very long jump range it would replace carrier as long range shopping ship
as much as i love eve theres always been a lack of something within the game on various different topics so id like to take some time and highlight some stuff i think would be great to attract more players1 massive lore eventsi know weve had the carolines star but that hasnt lead to anywhere as exciting people were expecting it to be yet i know many people were excited as to watching the star as patches were released seeing what happens next as i cannot see in the future i cant judge too much on carolines star but what i can point out is that many players like this sort of stuff maybe even drop things in without even alerting anyone and expect players to find out whats out there then again how do i know ccps already done that2 walking in stationsi know that this has popped up in other forums by other people but it is something that really could go somewhere if we look at it from a point of view that other space simulator games are doing similar things like this then it puts more people onto other games as to eve i know bittervets have been mocking this idea since it came around but as there is already a door for a similar feature it can be optional and so people who do want to use it can and those who do not can merely ignore it also i dont think it should be massively crazy like gambling rooms and such but meeting rooms was a good idea maybe even similar to dust514s pregame lobby and hopefully we can even interact with valkyrie pilots as well as mercenaries ill get onto that more on my next point even if the feature serves no practical use it sure makes a great experience for those who have been wanting it for ages3 expand the multisurface experience eve dust and valkyriethis may be a hard one to accomplish and maybe even trying to just bring dust and valkyrie to pc instead might help but an expansion of the already existing chain between the three surfaces would be amazing when we watch those cool trailers like the prophecy and all that thats what we want the reason people turn off of eve after playing the trial is because they expect the game to have features such as those displayed in trailers now although the trailers are a great way to introduce new players to eve i know many people would enjoy it if we could experience similar features as displayed in the trailers my main idea for this is to introduce the ability to walk around capital ships im probably going to get a lot of hate from bittervets for bringing this up but it would be amazing referring to the prophecy trailer again the prebattle meeting took place in the leviathan thats what we want if we could have the ability to have other players of the three different games to be in a lobby of some variety belonging to a capital ship or maybe any ship of a suitable size another topic relating to that is to have dust mercs able to interact with players outside of fw maybe if its just for alliances it would be a great length to have alliance vs alliance battles on planets and on the sky without having to join fw and maybe even have planetary resources collectible through pi and in nulsec regions having to have dust players fight for the sovereignty of a planet on the ground the possibilities are almost endless with the reaction of different players from the different gamesalthough i cant join csm as i am not old enough id really like to have my voice heard as this is something a lot of players in the game want thanks for reading
hello allwith the recent addition of manual flight the eve universe expanded greatly what was before difficult to pull off maneuverwise is now accomplished with relative easewhile i think that the current setup of flight controls is  okay i think it can be vastly improved with a few minor changeshere they areremove limitation on pitch control currently when you reach fullvertical up or fullvertical down you hit a barrier and can no longer change pitch angle remove this limitation so that you have full 360UFFFD movement in the pitch axis regardless of orientationchange direction left and direction right keyscurrently these keys change the yaw of your ship in my opinion it would make more senses for these keys to adjust roll and have yaw be controlled by pitch eample to turn left you would roll left and pitch up edit adjust response time for each shipthis one may be difficult to pull off but it has potential currently larger ships respond to key input at the same rate that smaller faster ships do in my opinion ships like frigates should respond almost immediately whereas ships like mining barges or battleships will be more sluggishthis control sheme makes more sense from a spaceflight standpoint and some users may find it more intuitive to pilot a quickmoving craft in this manner say an interceptorthoughts
far from simple i have a vague idea of how eve actually deals with motion of ships and what youre asking for would require fairly substantial changes to that roll isnt actually stored its generated from the change vector for example
i seeoh well i guess it was a pipe dream after allthanks for the info csm fly safe o
a couple release cycles back the anomalies and scannable items in space started magically broadcasting their sounds across the system for instance when moving your mouse from your overview to your gunscramchat areas it is quite possible for your mouse to be over the location for an extrememly short period of time and trigger the sound i personally find this sound to be quite irritating and completely unnecessary when i first encountered this i kept thinking a wire was loose in my headset somebody had a hot mic or something worse like motherboard failurei would imagine the mouseover mechanic would be easy enough to force a 5 second delay oni would imagine that adding 5 seconds of silence to the beginning of each of those sounds would be even easieri fully realize and accept that this is not really worthy of being discussed by the csm i first filed this complaint under bug or appropriate release feedback thread and obviously got nothing i accept the idea that the audio makes it slightly more immersive but i dont think a 5 second delay would be detrimental to that if you want to hear it youre going to mouse over it intentionally for more than 5 seconds

there are only 2 ways for a politicallybased discussion is and this is one either you answer all questions no matter how redundant or pointless to the best of your abilities or people will start making assumptions based on you avoiding answering said question which requires you to provide evidence to sufficiently dispel aforementioned assumptionsright now all your doing is making yourself look silly besides that you need to realize at this point based on your forum history over the years you opinion has become a little joke in the eve community you should realize at this point based on that past history the chances of you getting onto the csm are mediocre at best and frankly even assuming you did i wouldnt imagine you lasting long since so far you havent expressed the greatest skill in working or communicating with othersin short my faith in you as a representative or even a political figure is below that of mittens at least he could act like a politician
i have proof that xenurias voterbase is 90 female i am 90 female and 10 male and i voted for xenuria
there are rules here on the forum that preclude me from properly tending to some of the more wild elements of this thread i am not the first csm candidate to ignore trolls and flame bait
your also not the first csm candidate to not get elected because you treat every question you dont feel like answering as a troll or flamebait
to be fair ankhthingummy did get elected wit that strategy but she was about 8000x more politically deft than xenuriaalthough she was also equally batshit insane ofcedit
you seem not to realize why social corps and other means of wardecnerfs are necessaryif one is wardecced he must watch local mine aligned and so onhowever if he does so he could do the same in lowsec for much higher rewards i mean whats the point of doing an l4 watching local when you could do l5 while watching local so if someone is wardecced he is better off living in lowsecnow you can say that everyone should live in lowsec but then openly demand removing of highsec i doubt anyone would do that seriously and expect the game to survivethe only reason people live in highsec despite wardecs is that wardecevasion is trivial stay in npc corps be in a 1man corp and just fold corp if decced or hide and avoid anyone noticing you each of these methods demand players to not interact with other players which is both making them quit and prevent others from having contentyou need to realize that there is no possible way to move the npc1man corp people into wardeccable corps if you change something theyll adapt and hide more if you remove every possible way to remain wardec immune they just find another game either way you wont have them on your killboardtora sees that and offers a solution the social corp would allow players to interact without being instadecced at worst case there would be more subscribers to support the game at best they form a competent group and opt for being in a real corp

as someone who has an involved interest in managnig an npsi community my question to you bam is twofold how much experience do you have flying with the mainstream npsi communities what tools do you feel would be beneficial to social groups that exist solely for in game purposes specifically spectre fleet esque npsi fleets and incursion communities
while my corpmates were discussing the nearinevitable t3 nerfs incoming someone mentioned that t3s were that powerful because they had to be powerful enough to run wormholes what is your opinion on this subject should wormholes be made easier to compensate left as they are and thus end up harder overall should a new shipclass be introduced thats fit to run wormholes without overwhelming fleets in kspacedo you think it should be reasonable for a group of 1month newbros to survive and thrive in a c1 wormhole and slowly work their way up the ladder to a c6 or should surviving in a wormhole require at least 6 months of training and experience in kspace
what features would you like to add to the way standings currently work
one last question for youhow will you respond to the reports of open rebellion in your own channel  spectre fleet  requiring you to reset all those who had operator rights and to essentialy control the channel with a iron fist
i will advocate for reasonable changes i am not a member of a huge block ie goons n3 pl or large lowsec groups like snuff but i do advocate for smallmid sized gang pvp because thats where the fun is i also support more artistic contentishtar blobs  700 dps cruisers that can go insanely fast while applying their damage from a safe distance away does not add anything good to the game in my opinionmore clothes  more accessories  hats  get your eve internet spaceship barbie swag on  more burner missions  more challenge and more fun while making decent money great for all players of various skill sets not depending on being in a huge alliance with sovmore symbols  backgrounds  more colors in corporation logo making   i dont know why this hasnt been done yett2 frig logi  more fun in t2 frig comps not relying on t1 frigt1 cruiser logi let there be t2 bantams and t2 inquisitors i do not run to have a shinny patch on my boyscout sash i run to keep telling ccp to improve their game with suggestions from myself and the player base that is not always heard from
ive only recently returned to eve after ccp changed force projection and limited the use of things like isboxer but i have nearly quit before because of high sec wars this character is more indy than anything else so i do sympathise with your points of view however ive come to believe that the one thing that holds eve back is that high sec exists at all and the new player experience should be pushing pilots to 00 as soon as possible regardless of intended gameplay style high sec has so many rules  many appearing complicated even to bitter vets how many wormhole pilots get popped while just nipping to high sec for a skillbook because they dont understand the rules of engagement for high secok not many but i have seen it happen griefers or whatever youd like to call them understand exploit and undermine the rules to good effect and they will be the first to adapt to any changes that get madeif i had made a character right now as an indy character my main concern wouldnt be war decs it would be suicide ganking which to me appears to be very much in fashion these days so while i sympathise with high sec indy corps that get war decced i also think the solution is simply to move to null produce local sell local and rely on players not concord to defend you
you sir are a gentleman and a scholar i strongly approve of every word you wrotethis is exactly the problem with highsec not surprisingly player retention is best among those players who get drawn away from highsec one way or another during their first few monthsby the way pve and industry in nullsec and wormholes can be even safer than these activities are in highsec when players build safety networks of their own instead of relying on those filthy filthy npcs there is a huge difference between builtin securiy and emergent security as far the quality of the game is concerneddeath to the npc menace glory to playercontrolled content

sending a vote your way mike solid choice
a vote for sabriz is a vote for a better highsec you have mine
dear coreafter reading this thread i understood why some persons like you could also represent a part of the playersif someone has a real life a job and a family to deal with its a problem that corresponds to all players who love eve but dont have 24 hours per day for this gameits an important parameter to take in account by ccp i see you are 42 and how much it can make difference to take decision even in a gamevolition cult i seespirit of game isnt fond of piracy and murdering thats a important point to represent usits campaign so some questions to have an opinion please1 what would you propose in csm for new players 2 what about shares market and opening it so that it can work like a real stock exchange 3 what about extending anti piracy means even in the core game 4 what about walking in station extension lobbying 5 what about project legion lobbying 6 what about eve valkyrie linked with eve online lobbying 7 what about solo player style evolutions when you will have time i would be happy to read your answersbest regards
i plan to continue to push the subject and suggest it as a wonderful idea that everyone should love as much as i do within the csm as with all ideas and topics it is open to collaboration and opinion by anyone who wishes to join in i like owning ideas but i am not going to live in a void with a project with there being so many different play styles on the csm there would be many angles beyond my own personal knowledge cases that would apply
for the record i like this idea as wellmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
you have my vote i especially like the way you describe your eve in your character bio you demonstrate a rich and mindful understanding of how things work here
thats some pretty big callouts there bruh
believe it or not that was a compliment just using your reddit profile as a crude example you seem to switch between shitposting wildly and dropping wisdom bombs one of these doesnt belongs on the csm or in any official interaction with ccpjust sayin
i dont see how my reddit posts are official interactions with ccp the  i post on reddit i mostly post to amuse myself and others for upvotes its not how i speak on the csm in any official channel
that was exactly was the point i was trying to make originally but you took the initial quote out of context essentially even tho you act that way on reddit  a persona if you will  doesnt mean that youre going to act that way on the csm or when talking to ccp about important matters you know what youre talking about and you know when you need to be serious this is essentially what i was being accused of being unable to separate my in game persona and conduct myself professionally if i were to be elected to the csmit wasnt even remotely intended as a slight against you the mynnna analogy was meant in the same way  just because hes a part of the cfc doesnt mean that hes unable to speak for players outside of his own coalition or that hell use his position on the csm to forward his coalitions goals in game and nothing more theyre two completely different things full stop
yet another awesome trailer
well hello theremy name is lanctharus onzo and i am one of the cohost and writers of the cap stable podcastin early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10here is our announcement
a few questions for youwhats your opinion on the recon changes are they good for the health of the gamedo you think ccp needs to look at lowsec pvp not just hiseclastly you seem to be trying to be too much dont you think that a more focused platform may get you more support are you trying too hard to appeal to everyone
i was beginning to feel a bit lonely here thanks for the questionslike everything new in eve these changes garner attention that will dip after a while in a few weeks you can be sure that most medium plexes you warp to wont have half a dozen recons on grid with instalocking tackle waiting for you in general i like the idea that ccp is willing to think of completely new mechanics and ways to use a ship on the whole i like the changes however it is a little op at the moment ccp intended to differentiate the the combat recons from their cloaky brothers and this definitely fits the bill in that regard the cloaky force recons have less tank but have the ability to decloak right next to a target and lock him down once the targeting delay is done combat recons have more tank and gank i would argue too much in fact and dscan immunity but lack the covert cyno capabilities of their counterparts both are effectively invisible its just that one has to decloak to take acceleration gates or if it gets too close to an uncloaked ship or object and the other is invisible to you until you get on grid unless you have probes would it balance more if for combat recons their immunity to dscan was affected by their proximity to non immune objects or the beacons in fw plexes just like cloaks unlike with cloaking there would be no visual indication that the recons were now visible unless they scanned periodically themselves just an ideai think that ccp needs to take a holistic approach to the game giving focus on one area or making changes without considering other aspects of the game is bad this is why i feel that you need not just specialist candidates but candidates who are more generalised running for csm to make sure that changes are considered from as many angles as possible and to give as many points of view as possible from an informed perspectiveon the whole lowsec has undergone a vast improvement in the past few years with the fw changes gate gun mechanics changes etc but it could be better and there are lots of with things you can point to and say can we fix this like off grid boosting and most of these issues affect multiple areas of space theres always room for improvement in my experience lowsec is a generally great place to go roam solo or in a small gang and get mostly good fights sure you get the occasional problem of fighters assigned to an interceptor camping a gate or a more recently groups of recons sat in a medium or large plex but on the whole its great fun i would love to see more pathways into lowsec and other areas of the game for newer players as welli have a diverse platform for a reason i play in lots of areas of the game as i mention in my thread im not only a hisec guy a lowsec guy or an industrialist or a miner pvper pveer etc im all these things because i get a kick out of trying different things in my real life i work in an industry that craves specialists however ive carved out a niche where my passion for knowledge of all aspects of a subject are valued and i feel that i can bring that to my term as a csm so im not trying to be all things to all people im just showing the broad nature of my playstyle

can you expand on this i agree that wardecs are not perfect but what in your view is the purpose of having wardecs in the game at all do you have any concrete changes you would propose to make them more engaging and entertaining for both sidesas for ganking what is not working in your view it seems to me that industrialists and miners have a large set of tools to draw on to avoid suicide gankers what more would you like added to the game or changed to improve this intended mechanicfinally while i have you attention in your view what is the purpose of a corporation in this game is it a group of players joining to together to compete with other corporationsplayers or is primarily a social organization

i just took a second look through your main post i like your general idea for the most part though i have a few disagreements with it firstly i feel that the high amount of nullsec representation has actually been very good for the game i have followed some of those candidates and watched carefully what they were pushing for and have seen some of the best changes in eve come out of csm 6 7 and 8 they very much broke the stereotype again and again and pushed for changes that benefited everyone a lot of people still hate the mittani but i remain convinced he is the best csm representative weve ever hadsecondly i feel that your views on the ease of gankers staying safe is a little exaggerated i think perhaps you miss a lot of the work they do to maintain that safety and dont see when it fails ive been on both ends quite a bit and i must say that the prey tend to have it easier in eve however i am not at all without sympathy for them especially newer players as many of them still do not understand how to detect threats let alone run from them so i would agree with a push toward giving people more tools to defend themselves and especially toward giving new players more and better education on how to access those tools but ultimately theres still going to be bloodshed and hurt feelings and im more than okay with that i love iti have to side with malcanis what he said a few posts above about your campaign he put it more bluntly than i would have but he is also a lot more educated on the subject than i am also he makes an excellent point that if you wish to get votes you have to campaign in a way that makes you as friendly as possible
as ever your posts are solid and well written thank youright to the meat of it then we disagree on our opinion of mittens i see him as detrimental to eve over all so i hold him up as an example of where i feel null alliances and coaltions vote blindly for the candidate that they feel is representing their constituency i like some of the things sion has to say for himself i am not blindly going grr goons despite the perception people may havethe unhealthy factor comes from where the representatives live i am not a particularly good candidate because it has been some time since i lived in high sec or worm holes and i think low sec is a really strange case of being neither fish nor fowl there have been changes to analysing and hacking sites which i have not kept up with since i stopped being in a worm holes changes that i dont experience and so fall outside of my notice or dont impact me directly so i wont become so impassioned by themas much as we can argue for the mind and personality behind a candidate their perceptions are still skewed by where they live there needs to be a balance of representationideas that might impact worm holes for example need more than one voice corbexx for example comes from a large alliance in whs if there was a representative from a small wh corp there might have been a stronger stance against dscan immunity during the concept stagesi am not so much trying to stop ganking as i am trying to push for ways that the victims can counter ambush or stand up against the gankers instead of running add another layer to this aspect of game playmaybe we need a general guide for newbies that they will have access to when they start the game that gives them an idea of good fits eg do not dual tank ways to detect danger and avoid being killed videos demonstrating some situations the benefits of joining a good corp  alliance an idea of what to expect in low sec null and whs i will say though the rage against multiboxers and now afk miners has killed an aspect of game play the low isk rewards of cheap ores in highsec did not matter when you could do other things like check your corp forum chat on team speak share links check your emails get some work done from homeyou could still be in touch with the game and yet get some other things done while earning some isknow it has become one of the lowest paid routes yes even in null capped income rate while being as big a nuisance as trying to get some ratting done
correct me if im wrong but it seems that the income from mining has gone up significantly over the years and i mean after correcting for inflationsee now this is an idea i can get behind it has always bothered me that mining ships are so onesided they should be given the tools to fight back even if fitting for combat reduces their mining output thats a choice to let the player make not one that should be forced upon themall too often i hear people say the procurer is what i want because it has a lot of hit points and damage well it doesnt have a lot of slots it has zero utility highs and it doesnt have much powergrid you cant fit an active tank to a procurer you cant fit neuts its stuck with its superdrones as a freebie for people who are just going to afk mine and hope that anything attacking them will die before they come backyou know what id like to see on mining ships utility highs with unbonused missiles instead of or along with drones with the right balance it can be slightly weaker than a normal combat ship when fit with mixed turrets and launchers extra cargo space meets lack of powergrid or when fit for mining it still has a significant power to fight back and the beauty of unbonused launcher hardpoints is how easily you can instead fit a cloaking device probe launcher or capacitor mod in themand that still offers an advantage to miners who are busy with things at or near the computer than those who do not monitor at all because the ones within earshot and only managing one mining ship can jump into action when combat starts and let their missiles or neuts pick up where the drones left offi just feel that a big part of why miners feel powerless is because their ships are powerless
quoting you to the op another stellar post thank you from here because it will probably be lost in the depths of that threadnaught i can not agree more with the sentiment expressed
my favorite idea for fixing the threat of afkcloaking is setting limits on how many ships can come through a single cyno andor time delays on ships coming through or lighting another cyno to make hotdrops smaller andor slower still a threat but less of a omg its omegafleet they instablapped my tanked carrier
i agree there is something wrong that null sec holds the majority of csm seatsthis is the first time i have noticed your thread although  your methods are  interesting here is a bump at least we agree there is something wrong with the voting mechanism
if youre a powerblock fc it doesnt matter so many people know you that youll probably get more votes then some no name highsec carebear limiting free speech for the voting process doesnt work very well either fyi you also need to remember the csm are not the decision makers ccp is
i think youre both getting hung up on where the candidates came from and failing to notice that the nullsec candidates have been remarkably reliable in advocating changes all over eve there is clearly no great conspiracy here and few of the nullsec candidates including none of the ones anybody including the csm takes seriously are even pushing for changes that would directly benefit anyone in nullsec furthermore even if the nullsec candidates were ruthless and were taking the seats only for selfblueserving reasons they still would be advocating changes that would help their own specific nullsec group while trying to hurt another specific nullsec group without caring who outside of nullsec is affected in what wayone thing is doubly certain the nullsec candidates are no enemy to anyone outside of nullsecunless you consider providence to not be nullsec
big groups capable of voting in their candidate by majority popular vote democracy working like its supposed to oh no whatever shall we doif you dont like who gets elected vote for the other guys next time if you still dont win then obviously the people you have a taste for arent what a majority of the players who give enough of a damn about eve to vote want
at no point did i question the work done by these candidatesi retain however that the system in its present form is unfair
you posit that it is unfair and you back it up with speculation well statistics say it is fair the happiness of the eve playerbase with the csm shows it is fair the effectiveness of the csm and the diversity in their moves show it is fairyour logic is not flawed what is flawed is your perception of the way other people think there is definitely room for people to take advantage of the csm in a bad way it is very much a theoretical possibility but it hasnt happened yet and apparently isnt about to youre wasting your breath trying to fight a theoretical menace when statistically speaking you getting your way is more likely to cause a negative disturbance than a positive one even if the net potential for disruption is reduced
then shouldnt you take this up with the developer as they are the ones who construed this way of doing the votes being on the csm cant fix that as the csm do not fix anything want to find all the podcasts around eve online visit
this would be way more credible if you hadnt questioned their work before and if you understood the election systemso people vote for the candidates they like and do not vote for you you say thats a problem with the election system i say it fulfils the purpose if your ego cant handle that people discard you for a joke candidate you could stop being a joke candidate in your case i think its easier to strike the candidate part than the joke part though so good luck
i have cited my sources please cite yours actually the csm whitepaper is something the csm works with devs to change and adapt it is after all a living document i recommend you read the op original post for more information
i was introduced to npsi communities a couple of years ago by greygal when i began participating in agonyUFFFDs public roams later when she left agony and founded redemption road i was involved early on helping to promote her autz fleets and would occasionally fc themalthough itUFFFDs been some time since iUFFFDve done any actual fcing for rr i still go on their public roams whenever i can in fact i flew in their 100th anniversary roam just yesterday rip dickslapper 2000  gf hero i hope you enjoy the complimentary signed copy of my book iUFFFDd say i participate in 2  3 npsi fleets each month not always on my mainiUFFFDve never flown with spectre or rvb but i can attest to having lost several ships to the latter while theyUFFFDve been out on their ganked roams bastardsright now a chat channel and a mailing list is the extent of services the client provides to someone running a society thatUFFFDs clearly not sufficient when you realise that societies which includes npsi communities are often more complex organisms than many corporationssince youUFFFDre mostly concerned with npsi communities iUFFFDd say the main thing is standings if societies were a formalised entity within the game an npsi community should be able to set their own standings to other societies and corporations whenever a player joins an npsi fleet the playerUFFFDs standings would be temporarily overridden by the standings of the fleet commander as well as now making them true npsi fleets it would also be hugely useful when two or more npsi communities are cooperating temporarily such as recently when spectre and rvb formed up like voltron to kill nashh kadavrUFFFDs titanit would also be really cool if killmails reflected that a ship was destroyed by an npsi fleet similar to the UFFFDkilled on behalf ofUFFFDUFFFD message that appears on kms generated after a kill right was used UFFFDkilled by spectre fleetUFFFD or UFFFDkilled by bombers barUFFFD at the top of an npsi fleetUFFFDs km would be really cool and people would know who was truly behind it when the km gets passed aroundwhile weUFFFDre on fleets stop the client from treating the fleet window as just another chat window let fcs save and reload motds or fill out a proforma message when they create a fleet let the fc set up the motd so it displays the fleet comp to all members if he wishes and his requirements for hulls which updates dynamically as people join or leave a fleet this way someone coming into an fleet can see what they need to get in at a glance without bugging the fc or xo for the 15th time on comms or waiting for someone to answer them in chatfinally to give you an example of when iUFFFDve spoken up for npsi communities beforewhen i was at fanfest last year i attended the nullsec roundtable and during the discussion exccp greyscale floated the possibility of removing fleet warp reactions around the room ranged from dismay to indifference to approval when i spoke i told greyscale that i felt it would have a serious negative impact npsi fleets since they rely on the fc being able to warp the fleet to his tactical bookmarks corp bookmarks are no help since by their nature npsi fleets attract random people from all over i said if they must remove fleet warp at least add some other functionality so that npsi fleets donUFFFDt become a nightmare to shepherd such as allowing fcs to broadcast bms to their fleet so that fleet members can warp to his tacticals manuallynow nothing i said at the roundtable was actually that revolutionary the point is that when greyscale put the idea to the floor the other guys in the room began thinking about the impact on their own organisations my first reaction was to ask myself UFFFDhow will this affect othersUFFFDthatUFFFDs the attitude i want to take to the csm meeting table and not just a fanfest roundtable to be fair that would be a great help to everyone not just npsi communities
hii have known bam stroker forages this man has put his heart and soul into the eve communityan anecdotelast year there was a brisbane meetup it was fawlty7s birthday i believe i was lucky enough to host bam at my home for the weekend the meetup was a massive success with a little under 40 amazing spaceship nerds attending a good time was had by allafterward we got home bam stepped outside for a smoke what he was actually doing was having a little bit of a vomit on my back lawni found this puddle of joy the next afternoon long after bam had boarded a plane home since then i have fenced this hallowed ground off and crafted a small shrine the plant life has flourished creating a small but vibrant garden of bam every time i am feeling down or sad i go and sit before the garden of bam basking in its peacefulness and splendori believe that bam will provide a unique and valuable perspective on the csm his dedication to the eve community is unparalleled and hes just an all around good blokebam you have my axe my heart and my votes
bam is probably one the most enthusiastic people around when it comes to eve in and out of gamegiven how much time he has devoted to participating and organising community events i am confident he would be a capable and productive csm memberwill not hesitate to vote for him
toting my own horn here in order to serve the mighty bam strokereve meet is amazing every second i was working on it i had a nervous jitter to the point where i put that many hours in with 3am coding binges that i drove myself to the flu its summer herei wasnt putting the hours in because i love eve which i do i wasnt putting the hours in because i love the community which i do but because of the zeal and enthusiasm which bam had for the community and the future he saw for itand every moment i spent on eve meet i saw it too and every moment was worth iteven now ive begun work on some projects of my own thanks to bams gentle pushso vote for bam his passion for the community might be downright dangerous for your own health but youll love every second of italso wwwevemeetnet
bam has a rock solid track record in the community already its impossible to go wrong with him on the csm ill go one step further itd be downright silly to not include this man on your ballot a definite asset to the csm
hey m8rive trawled through my eve bet inbox and i cant find the email youre referring to could you possibly copypaste it into an evemail and send it to me along with your own email address and ill reply to thatedit ill send you an evemail as well just in case you miss this reply oeve down under  a community for players in the autz
thanks for posting this ariel because eve meet is an example of something that massively backs up the rationale of my platformit was at a player gathering in brisbane that i first met ariel and it was another player gathering eve down under when i put out a call to find someone help me develop the idea i had which led to eve meetits reasonable to say that eve meet may not exist today if it werent for the fact that the autz has been a hotbed of community activity over the last couple of years who knows what other cool things will grow out of relationships forged at these kinds of events and ingame societies if theyre given more attention and supporteve down under  a community for players in the autz

corbexx i did the eve vote match 21 and it listed you as my top pick at 91 i went through your responses and saw a lot of things i like but i did have a few questions now keep in mind these are neither loaded nor come with any significant experience on my part please answer them with the assumption that i dont know what im talking about and am here to learn1 when you say you feel that wormhole space doesnt need any ice or moon materials is that to force players to maintain supply routes with known space in order to have big things or perhaps you just dont like them being entirely selfsufficient2 you say youre interested in content harder than wormhole class 6 what does it even take to run class 6 sites i havent been above class 3 are capital ships necessary for class 63 you say youd like to see more wormhole effects but not more systems do you feel that the wormhole population is about right or too low and that it will stay low enough in the coming years even considering for a growing playerbase and possibly an increase in the percentage of players in wormhole space as for effects any ideas im curious on the specifics for wormhole effect ideas i like playing with numbers4 do you really think its okay to give players immediate info on market orders through apii was toying with an idea and want some input what if some new wormhole systems were added which are deeper than regular wormhole systems in that they only connect either with each other or to other wormhole systems but never directly to known space these systems could boast more selfsustainability with reduced value of random sites for those who like less traffic in their systemsin response to your campaign posti dont have any complaints you seem to be a guy who will get things done but since you speak of pos balance im wondering if you are going to push for improvement to pos gunning it seems like an unused part of the game
just to point out that vote match is from last years candidate pool i assume most of corbexxs responses are still relevant thoughfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
going to tack on one more question to my pilewhile debating ways to introduce hisec newbros to the many other different types of space i realized wormholes make an easy way to visit losec nullsec or wspace without straying too far from your hisec homebase or moving your stuff however the current tutorials unless they made changes im unaware of dont cover wormholes at all as such i suspect many newbros see wormholes not just wspace but wormholes to anywhere as dangerous endgame things rather than useful shortcuts to interesting placeshow would you get most new players to start exploringusing wormholes within 34 days of starting eve
ill tell you why i dont run incursions sure they give me more than ten times the income of any other activity i can find to do in eve and that is absolutely not an exaggeration but they also remind me too much of games like wow whether you live or die is a careful balance of applied resistance dps and reps it looks difficult until you do it then once you know you can and you know how its just too easy its not fun in fact its so unfun that im about as likely to run incursions as i am to mine mining may pay a lot less but its a lot less taxing too incursion running is like mining 235 hours per hour and pays about the same toodoes it have risk no do i need a risk metric to calculate that no its risk level wouldnt register a peep on any metric i can think of even the increased risk of being ganked because your ship has expensive mods on it is still mitigated by how fast you earn back the value of the ship was 3 hours for my navy mega running vanguards about 5 hours for the nightmare with a lower rate of activity running assaultsi have to agree with two step here in that highsec incursions pay way too much i think the best solution would be to dramatically reduce the income from those sites in highsec and then also significantly reduce the difficulty while also adding a lot more randomness it doesnt make any sense to me that you should need something over the 500 million isk mark to compete in highsec low and nullsec incursions might as well have the same base difficulty as highsec because they have so many other dangers to considerbut adding randomness will only hit highsec incursions hard lowsec and nullsec incursions might actually benefit from it provided the logi margins were a bit larger to compensatei have to offer a disclaimer in that i have not tried running faction warfare sites in lowsec people say they make more than incursion runners doing that and they do it in warpstabbed frigates if thats true then thats completely absurd income way too high you might be able to make that kind of isk in nullsec or wormhole space with the help of a wellorganized conglomerate of people who have to work to guard sovereignty for your access to such things but youre not going to do it with a ragtag band of ten and youre certainly not going to do it aloneill end this tirade with the accusation that the reason nobody can sort out the riskworkreward ratio of highsec incursions or faction warfare sites is that one is so small next to the other as to be invisible
what is your position on the jump fatigue mechanic do you think they need to be changed
if by changed you mean removed and put back the way it was noif you are asking if i think that any arbitrarily selected number or system can stand examination for iteration yes and probably should be checked for usage and effectsi was and still am in favour of the changes to power projection teleportation but am willing to discusss the nbuances and levels within that frameworkmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i always felt that one of the major problems with the old jump mechanics was that alliances would set up specific jump points and have them carefully planned out at maximum jump distances which forced players to learn jump drive calibration 5 merely to even be allowed into capital fleets that skill is useless in combat but can save a fleet perhaps one jump to get to the combat with the force projection nerfs i dont think this issue is any different as i understand it it is still important for ships to have the maximum jump range in order to get as much distance per jump as possible because of the way fatigue multiplies with each jump a larger number of smaller jumps takes longer to reach the same distanceive always felt that the jump mechanics should be built in such a way as to allow pilots with lower levels of jump drive calibration or none at all to be viable in capital fleets and removing the skill or changing its bonus to something other than jump range is not a way i would go about making the change i had the idea that perhaps if it were balanced such that the only disadvantage to a lower jdc level is a bit more logistics effort with no time fuel or fatigue penalties for making more jumps across the same distance then we would see a greater prevalence of capital fleets accepting lowerskilled pilotsperhaps even advocating training into capital gunnerydronesrr skills first and eating the organizational aspect in order to wind up with a more potent fleet especially large capital fleets could fly 23 capital segments at different intervals to provide incentive for eventually training jdc and to ease the organizational stress a bit small capital fleets could select intervals based on the lowest jdc skill in the groupany thoughts on the issue i mentioned or my solutiondo you think it would work as intended do you feel this is even a problem do you have any alternate solutionsi realize i might be barking up the wrong tree here if you feel you arent ready to tackle the question please point me to a nullsec candidate who might have experience better suited to it i dont know the current nullsec candidates very well im not even sure who they are except for xander phoena i think
dear mikeif you are a casual gamer living in high sec with a solo player style and dealing with a wife to be able to play i am sure you can represent a lot of usits campaign so some questions to have an opinion please1 what about shares market and opening it so that it can work like a real stock exchange 2 what about extending anti piracy means even in the core game 3 what about walking in station extension lobbying 4 what about project legion lobbying 5 what about eve valkyrie linked with eve online lobbying when you will have time i would be happy to read your answersbest regards
this is essentially impossible to directly enforce via game mechanics with eve structured as it is you would first need to remove alts or at least have some game mechanic that enforced accountability across alt accounts without that any debtassurance transaction that is not based on personal trust is laughable
i absolutely agree except that i also think there are a fair few in this game who have a somewhat similar negative experience in highsec and believe it to be much more dangerous than it is so i think the problem is that rookies see lowsec as orders of magnitude more dangerous than they see highsec while in both cases either one is orders of magnitude safer when you understand the basic dynamics and how to defend yourself with the danger level in both perceived by rookies it seems completely reasonable to stay in highsec going to lowsec appears to be suicide but if you were to see the danger in both as so much lower than a rookie sees it while the proportions are similar it makes lowsec available to take a look at highsec being safer at that point wont stop people from going into lowsec because lowsec is safe enoughso what im trying to say is that lowsec really is orders of magnitude more dangerous than highsec but not that going into lowsec is suicide rather that being in highsec is amazingly safe when you play your cards right while in lowsec there is still a lurking danger in the unknown factors i know highsec is extremely safe because ive played around with many of its socalled dangers and even marmite the only one to ever put up a fight is still a ghost when you simply avoid the tiny slice of highsec in which they operate but it doesnt matter how many times more dangerous lowsec is all that matters is that lowsec is safe enough to be worth going into thats all that rookies need to see
i dont see that mattering much as people will just falseflag themselves so often that noone will believe the flag anyway
the thing is highsec isnt one unified block of space and neither is lowsectama and fasse are both lowsec systems one is the only lowsec system im nervous to fly through in an interceptor if im in my learning clone the other is so empty that ive hauled a billion through it with 5 minute old scout inteluedama and vylade are both highsec systems and both are on trade routes one is a quite safe system the other very dangerous i would always take considerably more precautions moving valuables through uedama than through fassethe real danger in lowsec is entering it if you know how to enter lowsec safely ie avoid the most obvious gates its often safer than the dangerous parts of high
lucky me i happen to be familiar with all of the systems you mentioned dyoure ignoring the bigger point which is that fasse is a useless system nobody in there cause theres nothing to do even exploration turns up nothing no stations to make mining useful its too close to better systems and its a dead end you couldnt use it as an alternate route for hauling even if you wanted tobut uedama isnt dangerous it can be tricky for people hauling largevalue cargo in industrial ships but you merely need to understand the way gank gambling works you can very much fly a suitable amount of value between amarrjita and dodixierens and not get so much as a dirty glance from gankersnow id love to keep up this debate but we can move it someplace else if you like more on topic i definitely support more transparency in the system to make it easier for new players to see the real risk helping to dispel the paralyzing rumors and instincts that keep them out of a fulfilling time playing eve
perhaps probably actually which would be hilarious itself but i was thinking of its benefit to allies namely to get a quick headcount of whos awake in corp alliance or standing fleet i know plenty of players that like to stay logged into the game for various reasons but finding out whether someones awake or how many people in standing fleet are actually active is often annoying especially when youre trying to get ahold of someone very busy and cant tell whether they have to finish up a few things before getting back to you or are actually afksleepingthe opportunities for falseflag abuse are just icing on the cake
what im pointing out however still holdsfasse is indeed a very low value system with its only strategic value being as a way to get orcas or freighters full of ice and ore out of the highsec island next door or less importantly as a place to hunt for mordrus spawns but a large number of rookies would consider it very dangerous because its lowsec  you even get a warning before jumping in asking are you certain this system is very dangerousits very much less dangerous than uedama even though the highsec combat rules offer a player seeking to avoid starship combat more of an advantage in uedama than they would have in fasse of course a dilligent player isnt at much risk in uedama either the key thing is that there exist tools to provide warning as to the fact that fasse is the less dangerous of the two systems but these are not really taught to new players in the game client you need to ask around and be told to check your starmap for player ship kills podkills and less importantly but it can still be useful npc ship killsmanaging expectations of safety in highsec is as much as anything else about teaching people to use those tools
that benefit you mention is legitimate and something i hadnt considered as i tend to handle that afk checking in different ways i would be in favor of an afk flag in corp or alliance for local i see little merit either way
id still consider fasse more dangerous than uedama because my tanked cruiser is less likely to be shot in uedama where it is so far outside of any potential profit margin but uedama is definitely more dangerous to take anything of value i just find it easy to get by without taking valuable cargo through places like uedama at least now that i know how to avoid those places and where they are mostlyas for the afk in local i think it would only be useful for alliance intel if it were a default setting that happened automatically either way it would still be used for pvp and would unfairly confuse newer players if they arent to know who is a threat then they should not be presented with a functionality that pretends to tell them who is a threat thats just ui lying and its sort has been one of the major barriers to entry to the gameheres an idea make two default settings1 by default when you havent performed any actions for 5 minutes you get flagged afk2 by default you cannot see who is afk on the overview and the option to change them is buried deep in there somewhere where people wont find it on their own most of the timethis way you have to elect to be given the intel which acts as a stopgap to prevent confused rookies while disguising itself as one of those brutal facets of eve that gives veteran players an advantage
did you just say nerf newbies and buff afk cloakies
i dont feel that a buff to veterans is necessarily a nerf to newbies this game runs on malcanis law why start trying to evade it today all we need do is lessen the impact for the poor newbs and give them more time to revel in how powerful they will someday become if they stick with itbut furthermore i dont see how my suggestion is a buff to afk cloakies
there are several common complaints about standings that have been brought to me one is the slow method of repairing standings from a negative standpoint this topic was discussed during the summit summit and no resolution came of it yet the idea is that healing negative standings should become more flexible and more productive please understand that any time i speak of any type of standings repair it never ever goes above zero there are tools in high sec where you can turn in tags for instance for a standings buff but those agents are tucked deep in high sec space where negative standing pilots would have to deal with the faction police while trying to repair them much of this discussion comes from players who have decided to leave faction warfare and their repair comes at a long series of level one missions it makes me ask questions is our current mission system the best do people have to go through a series of level 1 missions to get to level 2 missions or should it be a choice if people could grind their standings back with level 4 and 5 agents instead of level one agents would it be a better solution it is a topic iUFFFDd want to sit back and engage in a broad spectrum of players with it needs to be more graceful when players walk away from a game mechanic and give up a chunk of the game they want to play rather than endure it i think it needs to be looked at and a way to make that better foundthe other idea is doing more for those with positive standings there are bonuses but why not more for those who keep them up more reasons and options to try to maintain high standings for those that do it is a mechanic that i believe needs to be looked at it needs to be a bit more clear and the information for gains and losses more obvious to the player
i want to see a fleet mechanic that allows fleet operators to make it public what your intentions are example a npsi fleet decides to broadcast open hostility publicly so that nobody is butthurt when they get shot by a blue cause they can see that the blue is in a npsi fleetthoughts
seems to be a faint whiff of drama just waiting to surfaceyet to be convinced the npsi community needs a dedicated csm ganked spectre fleet bombers bar all seem to do pretty well and there seems to be no mechanics that impinge them
i have to admit i had no difficulty with the idea of flying npsi with agony unleashed a couple of times maybe its because im in test or maybe because my corp is cool like that but i just didnt fear any repercussions from a mistake on my part on the contrary i rather relished the thought of possibly running into a blue or green and having to make a split second decision to assist my fleet or leave them alone i even spent a fair bit of time running through scenarios in my head and deciding how i would act in each i was a bit disappointed to not meet any friendlies during the roamor perhaps i wasnt paying attention and shot somebody blue who is mad and is gonna hunt me down laterthese sorts of unknowns add a sense of adventure to eve i know a lot of people dislike them but i am careful to advocate the ability to see through it because such functions quickly become fleetalliance doctrine and it destroys that adventure
there are a few things that i would like to see happen with the current fleet mechanics and the one closest to what youre talking is the fleet standings concept the gist of it is simple members of a fleet inherit standings from fc your blues are now the fcs blues your reds are now the fcs red and people view you in the same way they would view the fc these standings would preferably only apply for the duration of the fleet and only if the fc enabled that option etc etcwhether that is technically possible given the coding for standings and fleet i dont know
in the same way that there are no mechanics that impinge them which i would argue is untrue there are no mechanics that support the playstyle at all people have simply developed creative ways of using chat channels and mailing lists to organize these thriving communitiesalternatively you could make the same argument against sov warfare the system is currently functional wars are being fought sov is changing hands the alliance that live is sov space seem to be doing pretty well why do they need a csm why does sov need to be worked onthe csm does more than just fix broken things they let ccp know how and what they need to do to make the game better and there are a lot of different things that could be done to make the channel based communities better
i like this man because he is intelligent and wellspoken and whether or not i support his specific ideas i feel he has a good head on his shouldersthough i kind of like the ideas too1 i may vote for you
i found my notesthese were mostly questions for variety hopefully and are all hypothetical  imagine its 23 years from now and youre still on the csm the vast majority of your proposed tools for improving npsi outlets of the game have been implemented to a satisfactory degree and are mostly fitting in successfully this area of npsi public gameplay is now in an overall good place what is the next big thing you take on as your new agenda for change and cause for improvement in the game a relatively new player crosses paths with you during your space travels you end up chatting briefly and he or she makes you an offer of 300 million isk for 3 days training in the arts of eve assuming you accept what do you teach them  our beloved game developers somehow introduce a definitive change to the game that causes reactions from the playerbase similar to those witnessed in the incarna expansion a la monoclegate you agree with the players on this being a major issue what is you first course of action in tackling this lastly you find yourself in an ice cream parlour on a hot summers day sadly there are only two flavours of icecream left over chocolate  tutti frutti which flavour do you choosethanks twitter  wwwtricksofthetradesnet
of all the candidates running for csm i think none understand the game and how it is played better than manny he is my 1
as a csm candidate i want to focus on three vital areas of eveUFFFDs short and longterm development they are initiatives that have already proven their value to the community which is all the more reason ccp must continue to push and refine these initiatives modern marketing newer player experience building the exploration bridge modern marketingif youUFFFDve talked to your noncapsuleer gaming friends you know the public perception of eve online is terrible UFFFDitUFFFDs too late to botherUFFFD UFFFDitUFFFDs a spreadsheet simulatorUFFFD UFFFDi donUFFFDt have enough timeUFFFD UFFFDthe learning curve is too hardUFFFD UFFFDeveryone is a sociopathUFFFD tens of thousands of potential customers have been turned off without ever stepping into a pod UFFFD a complete shamethis may sound like a strange focus for a csm candidate but until the widespread myths about eve are dispelled and ccp takes a more modern approach to their advertising efforts the company is throwing away millions in lost opportunitiesi bring my professional experience in branding copywriting and marketing to the table for csm x iUFFFDve created successful campaigns for corporations here in the real world and i know how to get gamers interested in even niche titles like eve as stated earlier iUFFFDve already referred thousands of players to the game but iUFFFDve also been heavily involved in promotion for other titles via my youtube channel and at top tier tactics my previous gaming strategy website iUFFFDve also branded and built my own corporationUFFFDs website to wonderful resultscurrently i see a great number of opportunities for improving eveUFFFDs reach to the gaming public including but not limited toUFFFD strategic content arrangements with gaming press across multiple regionsUFFFD internally produced or community outsourced tutorials and introductionsUFFFD expanded efforts to promote external media creation from within the communityUFFFD video content partnerships with popular influencer channelsUFFFD ppcsem advertising campaigns to convert prospects at all levels of interestUFFFD a refined acquisition funnel with more thoughtfully constructed and tested landing pagesnewer player experienceof course you can lead a horse to water but you canUFFFDt make it press f1 we can get millions of people to try eve but the reality is that eveUFFFDs new player experience sucks if i remember correctly newbie retention rates have been estimated near 10 that number is abysmal but imagine the difference in player population if it could be bumped even 5 eve would be infused with new pilots cashflow and content at unprecedented ratesso whatUFFFDs to blame for the state of player retention most obviously the tutorial while much better than it was in the past is convoluted there are almost no explanations for basic game concepts such as the different types of navigation the relationship between ships pods and your avatar etc simple stuff like purchasing items and fitting your ship are basically a mysterythink about how many elements in the game are downright invisible to new players if nobody outright told you youUFFFDd have no clue that you could learn a skill to overheat your modules youUFFFDd have no clue how to overheat your modules you wouldnUFFFDt know what heat damage was or that you could repair it even if you bought nanite paste you still wouldnUFFFDt know how to actually apply it to your shipnew players need direction to avoid the feeling that UFFFDthere is nothing to doUFFFD we as experienced players know this is a naUFFFDve assumption but someone whose trial is about to expire canUFFFDt be asked to just believe the game gets interesting they have to be shown the possibilities and offered reasonable advice on how they can do itUFFFD increased emphasis on finding and joining player corporationsUFFFD ingame tools data or records to help evaluate a corpUFFFDs activities and trustworthinessUFFFD additional career agents or career paths pi incursions fw etcUFFFD a more refined UFFFDmasteriesUFFFD system with more obvious careerbased guidanceUFFFD basic intermediate and advanced navigation trainingUFFFD explain dscan and the goddamn camera controls to peoplecontinued in next post
building the exploration bridgewhen i look back at my eve career thus far however short it is compared to those of most players i see how wonderfully far the career path of exploration has taken me starting with a pitiful imicus probing deep into nullsec i learned brutal lessons in navigation intelligence gathering wormhole mapping combat scanning and interpersonal diplomacy before you know it i was capable not only of funding my misadventures but also hunting the competitors who once threatened my existencein the past few years weUFFFDve seen ccp promote exploration more and more heavily theyUFFFDve promoted special explorer dlc packs for steam to encourage newbies to scan the stars they built sisters of eve ships wellsuited to handle all types of deepspace content theyUFFFDve created new locations in the form of shattered wormhole systems and launched difficult sleeper caches to test the wits of adventurerswe are now at a point where the bridge is almost complete UFFFD the bridge that can carry enterprising newbies from knownothings to seasoned pilots unafraid to engage anything and anyone in all security sectors of space if ccp can successfully leverage its massive population of explorers there will be few limits to the amount and types of content they can createUFFFD expand hacking to pvp roles including hacking warp bubbles and abandoned pos sticksUFFFD meaningfully differentiate hacking and archeology or combine them and be done with itUFFFD continue to expand upon wormhole space with even greater rewards for daytrippersUFFFD fix problems and reinstate a meaningful riskreward balance for ess and siphon units UFFFD expand on exploration mining to give miners higher riskhigher reward optionsUFFFD revamp the beta map to provide meaningful information while traversing wspacei understand not everyone will be interested in exploration and thats okay because more exploration means that no matter where you live or what you do in eve the content will eventually come to you and by giving explorers more meaningful ways to interact with other players either via direct combat or by fiddling with their property we can increase dynamism and ultimately have more interesting stories to tell

a few questions for youdo you feel that the recent changes to recon ships have put them in a better place and do you think that those changes have improved fw plexing or did they hurt itdo you think there should be some kind of range mechanic that doesnt allow ships to use boosters within a certain range of gates stations or poss what is your favorite thing about fw and what type of things does fw offer that other parts of the game doesntyesterdays weirdness is tomorrows reason why hunter s thompson
another question why would it be sensible for any tlf fw pilots to vote for an amarr candidate instead of one of the fw neutral low sec candidates
its happening
best of luck davo fully support newbros getting involved with all areas of new edenscrew your courage to the sticking place
well since this question is going to come up eventually are you an official hero candidate
that will be determined later regardless of whether or not i become an official hero candidate i plan to campaign my guts outalso i recently received a pm i would like to answer publicallyi dont think my perspective is that different the largest spike of new players joining eve occured after the battle of br5rb a pvp event between nullsec coalitions i personally joined eve for pvp and sov fights and i assume a lot of other new players joined for similar reasons however i suspect a lot of new players think nullsec is endgame content they need to grind through hisec and lowsec to compete in hence why they stay in hisec my difference in perspective is from jumping straight into the deep endhowever personal opinion is one thing and can be rather misleading so i decided to dig deeper are new players staying in hisec because they enjoy it googling for information on new player motivations eve led to this mittani article on a ccp presentation about the new player experience at fanfest which subsequently led to this joystiq article on the same presentation as well as a youtube video of it judging by ccps statistics of 90 of new players either quitting or doing solomission play instead of engaging with the larger player base id guess most new players stay in hisec out of perceived necessity rather than choicethats an issue to me if i had stayed in hisec instead of trying my hand at nullsec odds are i would have quit playing months ago how can we get them to test out other waters outside of hisecmy solution emphasize wormholes wormholes provide an easy way to dip your toes into losec nullsec and wspace without going too far from home or moving all your stuff but they currently arent even referenced in the tutorials therefore most newbros are unaware of how to use them or think theyre more dangerous than they actually are point newbros towards the wormholes tell them of the lucrative opportunites that await on the other side and watch as they expand their horizons
dave isnt the most experienced csm candidate ever but hes a hell of a good writer and can explain exactly what he and other newbies find confusing or barriers to becoming more involved in the game ccp can use hearing directly from new players on the csm and i cant think of someone better than dave to represent new players firsthand
is this for real ive done black ops before generally it is a pile of guys sharing pics off the internet while 2 or 3 scouts scour the landscape as far as they can while still being in jump range 90 of targets are bots that autolog the second a nonfriendly pops into local the only way i could ever see jump fatigue really set in during this is if you were too lazy to jump the amazing 4 or 5 jumps via stargate and instead really really wanted to sit and do nothing for an extra  what  5 minutesblack ops can get you into a system past the usual 1 or 2 scouts it isnt and never was a viable solution to covering the galaxyfatigue is good for the game the only change id make would be giving caps a decent jump range again dreads always sucked because they couldnt go as far as a carrier now everything sucks like a dread using the jump drive should actually be worthwhile and get you more than 36 standard jumps it should also be able to span some of those little gaps between some of the outlying regions usually served by a single choke point

whatminutes are already upi dont evenedit rea that as im very impressed with this turnaround now to read
what are the the downsides as seen by people who arent that happy with it
holy shhhhooes oo
i am confused me goes reading schrUFFFDdingers missile i dig it  makari aeron
huge thank you to ccps logibro leeloo manifest and falcon for the super fast turnaround on these minutes
i stand by what i said including the drakeremote is harder   and still worth itmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
that was fast
respect im really impressed
keeping in mind that overall i am very happy with the new model it can at times be a bit more chaotic and stressful when you go from teams while having a say in what they worked on the final decision came from somewhere else to teams being responsible for that it adds to the stress i know i for one am still getting used to it
can we have some more details on this twofactor authentication was hinted at years ago at fanfest i forget which year exactly when ccp distributed donglesmdd
absolutely fantastic work on getting these minutes out so quickly i look forward to reading the rest as you release them i am super excited that ccp wants to remove attributes this is really something that has been a very long time coming i really hope that this becomes a priority because the sooner this happens the better for everyonei also hope that you remove learning implants from eve as they are a disincentive to pvp if a 15 mil isk clone was enough of a disincentive to pvp that ccp removed clone grades then a 40 mil isk pod two 4 implants is an even bigger onei know that people often bring up the idea of a learning booster as an alternative to learning implants that only lasts for a few days and wont die if you get podded the issue with this is nearly everyone will use it in all likelihood most groups will take to giving them out to their pilots for free brave would give them out because their atron pilots will get into cruisers faster and the cfcn3russians will give them out to help their pilots transition from doctrine to doctrine quicker or get better at flying their current doctrine it is a classic example of if everyone is super than no one is so skip the learning booster entirely also those groups that cant afford the advantage of giving everyone free or subsidized learning boosters will fall even further behind these groups and find themselves having a hard time competing with them that just leaves nullsec and such even more stagnant all around it is an interesting idea that ultimately would be worse for eveso please just skip any form of learning boosterimplant and give everyone the same flat sphour it will be the best decision for eve
you guys wow that is an impressive feat getting this info out to the community so quickly great job having been in the write and edit csm minutes hot seat i can really appreciate the work that went into this how fast does ccp logibro type pquick skim has me interested looking forward to a more thorough read
oh wow that would be nifty that is great newsi would like to add a couple thoughts on day 1regarding burnout and disinterest i think skill level v prerequisites should be reconsidered broadly speaking one of the results would be obtaining a minimumskilled ship sooner while still having the deep range of everything level v when a ship like the golem is within arms reach it promotes trial upgrades with a closer carrot without shortening the training period of maximum specialization the current convention of specialization need to be sacrificed things like a minimumskilled golem not including guns being 90 days away come on no trial player is motivated by that its not even that great after satisfying the minimum skills to sit in itmaking eve look cool while the player is afk other games have a healthy pulse when it comes to art the utility of this art is maintaining the games presence while the player is not actively playing the social media support is great the share image buttonmy pick would be imgur however you could still release more art even if its just wip scraps and screenshots of incomplete models and art any types of art blogs or image dumps with a ccp dev name attached to it would be awesome its selfreferential as a game and possibly immersionbreaking but i think its appropriate for spreading awareness while afk it also indicates more life on the dev side of thingstrue there is eve now the site but its presentation is more polished and professional and slightly corporate as a born texan i am deeply moved by steve ronukens chili recipe
clarification requested would the upper limit still remain 7spelling nit hangar not hangeredit a little further downme happy danceoh poop i suspect that she asked this because i asked it of her i just double checked on the corporation interface and they already have separate name lists one for wallets another for hangars so sugar kyle i apologize for making you look like a nimrod on this topic i accept all the blamemdd
on the subject of social clubs aka societies which i think is a great name in addition to the stated features chat room mailing list personal standings and fleet finder adverts two features which seems like theyd be very useful would be shared bookmarks and shared hangars i recognize that last one may be a bit pieinthesky thoughmdd
good work any chance we could also have a text version pdf is awful for mobile devices which is practically the only way i get time to read this stuff
but you will miss out all the pictures of cats di will put something together tomorrow 
that cat is that what caused carolines star a giant firball i would love to see the number of ddos attacks ccp survives each year
for sort of a middleground idea jump freighters only require freighter iv instead of freighter v requiring that would mean that at least some level of specialization was required per faction as is the stated theme of t2 without the enormously demanding monthorso train of getting a cruiser for example to v it would for better or worse mean that you would have to be careful about what bonuses went on the basehull skill as opposed to the t2 skill of course
i must say i like the turnaround time on these
i think you would be amazed at how much of a difference it would make if you could do something as simple as customize the skin of your ship directly especially for new players or bored bitter vetsif anybody ever played city of heroes that would be a good analogy of what i am talking about all the archetypes had the same power sets and nothing you did in character customization made any difference in the actual play but it made all the difference in your investment in the toon and made character generation a blastin eve the ships are the toons in my analogy and if those could be customized using an ingame interface similar to the ui but specifically for the ship people would want to get in different ships just because they look cool this is antiutilitarian and seemingly stupid but its the little thing that make a game fun and worth it it also drives goals and motivation for new playersi have played this game on and off since 03 and surprisingly enough the one thing i dont really feel like i am ever really doing is making stuff mine it is just stuff i happen to hold there is nothing special about any of my beloved ships no battle scars no tweaked out appearance my thorax is just a thorax like all othershalf the game is also shopping my wife loves shopping and yet still hates eve i guarantee if she could shop for a thorax that was custom skinned and on market as a customized model simply a different player designed skin she would be at it for hours or designing and selling her own hell she might even go into production and mine and do all the other manufacturing crap just to have her own line of designer thoraxes its the seemingly stupid trivial things that make bigger mechanics work i have manufactures all kinds of stuff in eve and it is just variations on a bland theme to play the 01 isk game etc its not like me making it felt like i made it but rather jumped through the right hoopsmight as well shoot the red crosses in other words even though i made it there was nothing special about it whatsoever might as well makes drops in the oceanif that makes sensethe current skinning is a peta and the licensing and aura driven funky model now where they are yet still made on your behalf is likely in the wrong direction i am probably describing it wrong because the mechanic should be right there in the fitting window or a fitting type window instead of some external store that i have to do things and stuff to get it which i will likely never bother to learn or care about i love eve and have played it forever this is by no means the one thing missing but having tried to recruit all kinds of people for years mostly unsuccessfully and more importantly seeing what they do end up playing i think a simple thing like this would go along way to drive new subscriptions and give people reasons to try all aspects of the gameminecraft is insanely popular because building stuff is fun especially stuff that is unique to you even though it functions the same or similar to all other similar things
as penance for my causing sugar kyle to look stupid i did it for you ccp leeloozappity check here
you mean theyd have to put effort into skill bonuses instead of treating the base skills as a role bonus
a good read next time the minutes will come before the summit i really like mikes idea of societies however if these get bookmarks why not also make it possible to create fleet bookmarks plz ccp i really liked the cat she is a beauty 7o dear csms  devs
thank you leeloo and mail
oohhh thats awesome i owe you a drink
this was interestingwhat about doubling the skill ranks to ten and halving the bonus per level this would leave the overall power level unchanged but allow intermediate steps between iv and v
one of the perks of working in the document management software industry is that i have a stupid number of tools for working with pdfs mdd
people tend to not want to talk about ddos and so on its generally done for attention and saying we survived these pushes some people to redouble their effortsignoring them doesnt stop it but it makes it less enjoyable
wait but how do you talk about not talking about it without talking about it
i would answer that in detail but then we would be talking about it wouldnt wemmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
ccp logibro and team  gives you nice things when you say the magic word
role bonuses arent innately evil yknowbut yeah some of the more rolebonuslike bonuses might need to be looked at im betting theyd be fine though i do remember when t2 resists were hull bonuses instead of role bonuses even if i was an antisocial missionrunner leveling up my raven back then
appreciations for going to volcanolandstick a wikilike instruction manual into the game individual pages could be opened from a contents menu by searching or contextually from rightclicking an ingame object or ui element for easy and quick access no guides no commentary just succinct and accurate descriptions of game mechanicsevelopedias really slow to load and the search function has always turned up nothing but garbage for me in the past ive just typed what i want into google  evelopedia or gone to eunis wiki
with all the threads in fi that start with a phrase similar to i dont know if this has been posted when theres an identical thread on the first page of fi its a lack of use of the search function that is the problem not the search function itself besides when internal search fails google always finds it
to preempt a question asked in another threadyes with a caveat yes he said no equivocation but as with most things yes or no is too simplisticthe caveat is you have to look at the conflict from a holistic perspective for example removing concord would increase conflict for a time but long term it would kill highsec driving players away and thus reducing conflict over time
you cited youre sources but never showed evidence so i still think you are blowing smokehey look guys another read the original post comment how original
xenuria you may have cited sources for other information not related to the topic but i was pointing out that your logic is flawed there are no sources to cite for that except yourself unless you have borrowed the logic from someone else that im not aware ofim trying to help you see why youre flailing and help you improve your presentation quality and you are treating me as an opponent to be won against in a contest of writing command and knowledge of esoteric rules of convention the entire purpose of the csm is to help ccp hear the voices of the playerbase the csm is in fact the best place to go for csm reform
i would like every csm candidate to confirm or reject support of the idea of applying the following statement to all future proposed changes to eve mechanicsif the proposed change to game mechanics is expected to reduce conflict it should be rejected if the proposed change will increase conflict it should be embracedsimple yes or no without equivocation or weasel words with that one answer voters can have revealed to them who will truly protect the sandbox and who will let one slip past the goalie one day and harm itxenuria f
that statement is silly what about you mut rack up x killmails per day or your character is deleted should we embrace that
bad redherring is badid actually like to hear from xenuria himself on the spirit of the question though if thats ok with you unless your his campaign manager and i didnt get the memo f
noi reject the idea and here is whyconflict in eve is a good thing but absolutes in the flow of gameplay mechanics is a bad thingno single mantra or conceptual ideal should shackle the collective creativity of the entire process absolutes are dangerous because they are void of context by their definition eve and its process is a garden of context silly example would giving players the ability to instantly teleport their ships to any system provide conflictyes it would provide a gratuitous amount of conflictis it a good ideanoi do not see you as an opponentplease list in specifics which sources i have not cited or which statements i have claimed to be factual and did not provide proper citation
actually it would reduce conflict as people would be more afraid to undockwhat is the importance of who cited what sources any sources you have cited demonstrate nothing to support your points if valid they are outside the scope of your presentation and what sources do you wish for me to provide are there factual bits ive given that you wish to dispute point them out and ill see what i can do
i wish i could empty quote thisi really cant take your criticisms seriously if you have no intention of standing by them when challenged
i have to retract my previous endorsementtora went full raging because i also hired another merc deadly fingertips and started to fling poothis isnt just bad because childish pooflinging is bad he could just end our contract silently but because it shows he cant represent anyone outside marmite can you imagine him talking for a change that benefits deadly fingertips or other highsec deccer after he rather lost my 28bmonth than let others have a piece of the cake
vote for tora because he really enjoys eve content and doesnt care about 25 billion isk a month when it comes to making the right decision gevlon no worries mate i understand your frustration its not easy to deal with people who cant be bought edit  in case you have no idea what this is about 
marmite collective  the only mercenaries that cant be boughtnice catchphrase you got there
i would like every csm candidate to confirm or reject support of the idea of applying the following statement to all future proposed changes to eve mechanicsif the proposed change to game mechanics is expected to reduce conflict it should be rejected if the proposed change will increase conflict it should be embracedsimple yes or no without equivocation or weasel words with that one answer voters can have revealed to them who will truly protect the sandbox and who will let one slip past the goalie one day and harm ittora f

ive visited your fair shores several times now most recently for eve vegas and ill be coming back again in 2015 because freedomsnip please refrain from posting ascii art within a forum post isd ezwaledit also i really like your outfit 32nd edit fyi hendrick this is the ascii pic that was removedeve down under  a community for players in the autz
thanks for the substantial reply i would object to nothing you have suggested there
whhaascribbles notes furiouslythats an awesome idea that id never thought of before
that is pretty insightful snip please refrain from personal attacks isd ezwal
corbexx here is a soft ball for you to hit please link me the best piece of writing that you feel refutes the argument worm holes are isk faucets whether you or some one else wrote it does not matter
not only is isk faucet poorly defined in your question but youre also working on the assumption that wormholes shouldnt be isk faucets why shouldnt they pay out more than other areas of space with more risk comes more rewarda better question would be corbexx do you feel that isk generating activities in wormholes are too lucrative which is a question for may as well answer corbexx
jenshae is actually working on the assumption that they are currently not isk faucets regardless of whether or not they should be i would counter that they are isk faucets as is easily demonstrated by the loot they provide which is turned in directly to npc agencies in known space in unlimited quantities for a flat rate isk value as to their significance in comparison to other isk faucets there are charts for that unfortunately i cannot find one at the moment but ask ccp and they can tell you exactly how much isk comes from wormhole space relative to other sources they track this info
apologises for late replyin regards to should wormholes be made easier if t3s do get nerfed i dont think its needed all the sites can be done in ships other than t3 caps and rapiers easily do c5 and c6 cap escalations marauders can handle c5 and down a couple guards and hacs will also easily do most stuff i dont think a new ship class would be needed at all to do sleeper sitesi think its fine for a group of 1 month old newbros to survive and thrive in a c1  i moved in to a c3 1 week old with some mates it might not be the easiest thing fair play if they can grow and move up to higher class wormholes should they wishi dont think surviving in w space should need 6 months experience in k space what i will say is while i do like new people in w space im not to keen on trying to force 1 day old new people in more for the fact that w space isnt the safest or easiest place to survive in without a decent group to help support these playersmy alt is actually in the brave wormhole newbro corp catastrophic overview failure and they got a couple of really new players 2 or 3 day old and brought them in to the wormhole and ive been chatting to them about how they are finding it without the corp helping theyd really struggle
i would love to see 1 but as malc says there would have to be an entire structure of an enforcement arm financial concord or there would be no accountability without accountability a stock market is waaaaay too hazardous for all but the most wildcat investors as for antipiracy are you talking about takingmaking concord contracts maybe a mission hub that notices the bad standing folks in the region and offers you a chance to hunt and shoot first without concord slapping your hand or even higher level ones that send you into low to hunt them down on their own turf and what do you mean core gamecomics have a phrase too soon i am not sure if we have crossed that line with incarna yet i would settle for a licencing of unreal engine if carbon makes graphics cards cry and die would i like to see stations a living environment yes am i going to promise it no does ccp have other things on its plate right now yupas for 4 and 5 lordy i am looking forward to those games but they are games not under the purview of the csm we are the council for the space side eve and not an overwatch of all of ccps licences if the games have a direct linkage then it will come into our wheelhouse but as of now there is nothing to lobby about dust will become legion and i assume that it will continue with the cpm i have not heard anybody mention a council in connection with valkyrie although they have let the council try it in the years gone bymmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
mike has my vote and probably the number 1 spot
mikethanks for these answersfor point 4 and 5 they have an important impact on eve online regarding new coming games like scfor this reason to protect from members escape i think even csm members should speak about this impact on our gameccp makes a good jobbut sometimes i am not so sure that market decisions are the bestdust or world of darkness could be some relevant examplesits probably exciting to play with oculus but for a space shooter we dont really wait for eve valkyrie there are a lot of other games for thislinking eve valkyrie to eve is a strategic decision against sc and much more for eve onlineas csm member try to do your best to show it up to ccpit could also be a good future program for a candidatebest regards

some comments for you and whether you would support something like this1 the new player experience needs to be tweaked and it can be by just doing a few things could you bring up to ccp to map wasd to directional as default for every new eve installation its silly to make people map out those keys just to figure out movement its being hidden from them requiring them to hit escape and map 2 the default ccp overview is crap while we can now transfer overviews the default needs a total remake basically have ccp come out with a viable default for every new game installation pick the best and that becomes the new default for players until they make their own theres no need to handcuff a new player and to tell them get a ui from someone else who you cant trust3 a test should be run regarding voting for csm so can an incentive be given to the player to get them to vote something like you vote and receive 5 geicos or a gnosis or a free ingame frigate skin exclusive to that vote year it would kick the whole its worthless to vote for csm if the players receive something to vote i wouldnt do skill points but something like a ship or a skin or some geicos might work it should be tried this year and if it doesnt work no need to do it if it does though just some thoughts

i agree with your quote with only very minor reservations mainly that i see a purpose for rookie systems remaining basically free of conflict but also free of valuable resources
i personally like to ask in fleet x up if you are afk then when no one xs up those few who are there undock and die hasnt failed yetother games do have a pop up ready check that group leaders in eves case fcs can run and it tells them how many said ready how may said not ready and how many didnt respond something similar should be fairly easily implemented and could be useful in fleets it wouldnt affect local obviously but it could be useful in corp chat
thats an incredibly simple view to take on complex issues ideas should be looked at for their individual positives and negatives even if it reduces conflict following your idea some pretty important changes would not have been made not least of which the recent jump changes which most certainly reduced conflict sorry but views like that are as likely to spell the end of eve as the completely opposite view where any change that increases conflict should be rejected
i forgot about the wow raid ready checks that would be obscenely useful for standing fleets
correction overall the jump changes will over time contribute to increased conflict not reduced the reduction in the ability to escalate a conflict means more fights will be committed to instead of standing down out of fear of a counter drop the conflicts will be smaller in scale naturally but there should be more of them
have i mentioned that this idiot is the day to day leadership of my corp as someone that briefly played wow i can confirm that this feature is useful in groups that are both voluntary to join and expected to remain consistently active so useful for fleets but not corpalliance wide as corpsalliances often have people who are online dockedpossed and afkthe wow feature in question is very obtrusive it takes your clients focus and must be clicked through to move on it would need to be unobtrusive in eve otherwise spies in blob fights will spam it at bad times such as 0252 seconds after someone broadcasts for reps and screams in voice break break my nyx is at 15 structure im for spies having disruptive tools to use in fights but they should not be based upon restricting the abilities of other players to communicate with their game client
i agree with tengu here removing the spectre of massive counterdrops makes fielding capital fleets in combat more viable in the game the game was on a trajectory toward total stagnation prior to phoebe that might have seen one or two more very large set piece battles like br5 but wouldnt have seen the loss of ten carriers here six dreads there one supercapital here etc in terms of driving conflict however the most successful change in nullsec in recent years was the moongoo reshuffle which led to a nasty breakup between goons and test and content that even spread into highsec
confirmingi agree that if anyone can start it it would need to be unobtrusive however i was thinking and forgot to mention that really the fc is the only person who needs to be able to do this well fc or fleet boss in the event they are not the same person
true and if your fcs a spy you have bigger problems than spammed checks
1 sugar kyle i can confirm from personal experience that she listens to the player base and transmits our feedback and suggestions to ccp

as someone said in another campaign thread its not that simple ive murdered people in an instalocking hic in low sec gate camps and in that sense i was driving conflict i also got killed doing that when the bigger fish arrived so still driving conflict if i was able to do that with impunity on the jita 44 undock it would drive conflict but not necessarily be good for the game
i cannot answer yes or no and you do not want any other words about it
that reminds me of an experience i had in a small scifi pvp mud years agonew players started on earth in order to do anything you had to launch off earth and travel to other planets however the moment you reached earth orbit a camping battleship immediately blew up your ship i tried several times over the next few days to leave including pooling my money with other players to buy a better ship and got blown up every time checking the games forums i wasnt the only one with this problem apparently the players spent 10 hours every day just camping earth orbit and blowing up new players trying to leave just for the lulz the games developers said the game was workingasintended and that they wouldnt act against the camper the popular theory among the forum populace was the camper was close friends with the developers i quit a few days later and moved on to greener pasturesthere was plenty of conflict there it was just horrendously onesided and caught new players in a catch22 loop of needing a more expensive ship to leave earth but being unable to make money without leaving earthnot all conflict is the same there are certain types of conflict we want to encourage and other types of conflict we want to avoid like the plague in addition there needs to be downtimes between conflict an ebb and flow between conflict and peace etc if for example all of nullsec was locked into sov war and fighting over timers every day there would be obscene burnout amongst the nullsec coalitions
apologies i have been sick as a dog and really got behind on my posting ill pm you to find out what dates suit you
apologies for the delay responding to you i blame h3n2 variant flufirst i should say that i am part of the supercapital problem i have a titan and a supercarrier of my own and have encouraged people in my corporation to get into supercaps to the extent that bat country a small corp at the best of times have the fifth or sixth most supers in the whole cfc so iUFFFDm not coming to this from the point of view of a supercaphating goon with a lingering inferiority complexccp had the chance to do something radical about supercaps years ago but the genie is out of the bottle now i have heard figures mentioned that suggest that there is now a substantial fivefigure total of supercapitals in the game even assuming that only six or seven thousand of those are subscribed ccp do not strike me as being in the sort of position where they can afford to have those accounts unsub let alone the associated subcap accountsbut i feel that they have to do something groups like brave newbies have amazed me with how far they have come in the past year but the fact is that they cannot hope to compete with older groups like ncdot pl or us in a serious sov war without essentially standing behind the shield of one of those groups i am sure that i am far from alone in having newer players despondently mention that they feel it is impossible ever to catch upi donUFFFDt have a simple solution because i believe there is no longer a simple solution perhaps a specialised role can be found within the new sov revamp perhaps the longsuggested solution of UFFFDchoose a station ok here are the relevant number of capital componentsUFFFD is not yet impossible but i donUFFFDt want to play a game where serious warfare is predicated upon only one class of ships even if we have the most of those ships
re your second question as it was we were stood on and shovedaround by the major powers in 2006 and the disparity we faced back then was only one of being in cruisers while facing hacs and battleships we didnUFFFDt succeed because of ability or ships i suspect that the leadership and the resilient culture that saw us through would probably have had a chance today too but it would have been desperately hard and we would have been faced with paying rent or protection money to one of the hegemons not a glorious storyi think that adding more conventional kspace systems would be inviting more renting by the same dominant blocs who would snap it up in a matter of days i suggested on my blog that the solution was to make groups require less space to allow for more dense occupation of space and to make it far harder to hold large tracts of space i think that the phoebe changes although a trifle cartbeforehorse in implementing the power projection changes before the profitablenullsec changes were at least a step in that directiontechnically we rented some belts in a system in syndicate as it was
a more balkanised eve absolutely implies an eve in which the cfc and n3 cease to exist in their current vast unwieldy forms frankly i would like to see an eve in which even an alliance the size of goonswarm is seen as unnecessary this should be done as i suggested in my blog not with the stick but with the carrot once people no longer feel the need to huddle up into megacoalitions then those vast blocs will drift or fly apart as the centripetal forces of fear that hold them together no longer counterbalances the centrifugal forces of drama and independentminded leadersas to how this is achieved i will spare people the need to read the vast tracts i wrote on the subject at endienet in the summer of last year but it is all there
i wish that i had put it this concisely
is it easy to take sov though i have taken part in sovwar small scale and it didnt seem easy what with the endless timers i guess its easy to take sov with lots of supers with subcaps not so muchill read your articles on sov and nullsec
it is easy for the established powers to take sov from younger powers the most recent example i can cite is the recent pl vs hero war in which pl managed to take a halfdozen systems from us threatened an important gateway system and nearly aborted one of our supers now note that all that was them playing with us if they really wanted to they wouldve held a halfweek bashathon and conquered all of catch driving out the several thousand active brave players once they did they could essentially control catch without actually living there they could just fall back to npc nullsec and just show up for timers to dissuade us from recapturing catch and essentially turn it into a ghost regionthought experiment if pl cfc or nc wanted to they could form a marauding band of supers smash into every younger nullsec coalition that couldnt fight back drive them from sov they had occupied for several months and immediately move on leaving desolated nullsec in their wake it is feasible the supergroups could depopulate vast swaths of nullsec albeit not practical because they could make more isk from renting it out without putting a dent in their own resourcesthe chances of them falling into a vietnam warlike situation where a superior force takes expensive losses trying to conquer territory from inferiorbutpersistent defenders is very slim it is far more likely the defenders in this situation take crippling isk losses while a moreexpensive attacking force takes almost none because the defenders cant break through their repshere i will reference the december 5th battle for hedgp which in my opinion should be mandatory study for anyone interested in supers vs subcaps balance or the power struggles between older and newer coalitions there pls subcap fleet got wiped out leaving a few dozen capitals  supers at the mercy of 800 bloodthirsty brave defenders brave had enough firepower to wipe out the capitals drones effectively neutering them in response pls capitals turtled up repping each other brave couldnt break through the reps so what followed was a 2hour fight to keep pls supers tackled while we batphoned black legion to bring enough firepower to crack through their reps in the end we only managed to kill 1 super before nc warped in its own group of supers to reinforce pls fleet once again making them nighunbreakableactually endie i would like to hear your thoughts on that battle for hedgp since it is in my opinion the best example of an allout supers vs subcaps brawl in the game thus far in addition what other fights over the past year do you think should be studied by the csm
this is where i believe eve needs a new class of ship a subcap designed to kill caps and supercaps
isnt that what battleships are meant to be well perhaps could be i know theyve fallen out of favor in the current meta and itd be nice to give them a bit more lovebut there is still the underlying problem of breaking through capital reps the biggest issue with supers isnt the dps its the reps because once you reach a critical mass of supers repping each other you can survive forever against most fleets players will argue capacitor draining is the solution to that but since you can install capitalgrade remote cap transmitters that is no longer a problem once you reach a critical mass as well wed need to make it so if you field a group of x supers you could still lose a few to a slightly inferior force rather than forcing your opponent to bring x10 supers just to put a dent in your reps but that would probably require redoing reps entirelysadly the only experience i have with capitals is on the frustrating receiving end so i mainly know them as these nighunstoppable juggernauts rather than being familiar with what weaknesses they already have
a dark newbro jokeq whats the best advice you can give to a new eve playera start 8 years agobut yes i realize hero started similarly to goonswarm years ago ive also heard plenty of taunts and insults that we do not belong in nullsec because were not powerful enough or that we are only alive because the superpowers view us as pets or entertainment if either are true i think their truth would speak more about problems with nullsec currently than a fatal flaw in hero itself namely that our biggest problem is we didnt start 8 years ago
you should have seen some of the things that were said about goonswarm when they were at a similar stage in their evolution
granted we havent had leadership of a rival alliance state we didnt deserve to play the game yet
i would like every csm candidate to confirm or reject support of the idea of applying the following statement to all future proposed changes to eve mechanicsif the proposed change to game mechanics is expected to reduce conflict it should be rejected if the proposed change will increase conflict it should be embracedsimple yes or no without equivocation or weasel words with that one answer voters can have revealed to them who will truly protect the sandbox and who will let one slip past the goalie one day and harm itmanfred f
just to make sure im reading this correctly it sounds like youre saying that what hero needs is basically 10 trillion isk to buy a supercapital fleet and pilots for it im figuring that would buy you 1200 supercapitals distributed somehow between titans and supercarriers and alts to fly themim not trying to belittle this im just trying to confirm if youre basically saying that asset and skill point disparities are the main things that were highlighted and that those are pretty fixable
glad to see you are running again manny ive always had a ton of respect for you and your knowledge of the game best of luck to you
you mentioned i believe on  on zulu that you were against changes that put a limiting factor on the social behavior amongst the playerswhat are your thoughts on the concept of a no intra corp violence feature ccp punkturis announced that her and the team she is a part of are looking at from the csm 9 winter summit dev blog these changes are already being worked on what are your thoughts on them do you feel intra corp aggression is something that should be limited in places like hisec for the benefit of the newer players as ccp stated on the o7 show
i apologize for not reading the csm 9 summer minutes blog for information on the polices for the csm x candidate qualifications silly me
i know actually informing yourself about csm stuff when discussing csm stuff how crazy is leeloo
responses as promised now that im back on a normal schedule there are a couple of metaissues going on here as someone who blobs rather filthily on a regular basis the number one thing that enables us to make solo pvpers miserable is the fact that there is an intel inbalance between us and the people that we kill this is a problem which can somewhat be solved by the players rather than by the developers  in particular
this is an earnest and thoughtful man and the csm would be well served by having him on board has my top vote
iUFFFDm alyxportur i live in delve sovereign space and i fly dpslogistics characters under the kadeshi i grew up and out of highsec nearly four years ago and iUFFFDve been flying pilots in nullsec sov alliances for nearly three years now i never plan on quitting eve until i either die or iceland gets covered by lavarising atlantic wateras i promised last year i will promise again whether you vote for me or not if i win i will still represent all of you as best as i can we all want to see eve continue to survive as a game we love but also thrivesince my last campaign ccp has improved upon two issues corporate bookmarks and power projection the corp bookmark limit has increased but for nullsec groups this is insufficient without alliance bookmarks corporations have identical bookmarks to locations like jump bridges alliances may have been the band aid to early corporations banding together based on standings but it isnt a temporary fix anymore alliances continue to need their own bookmarks upping the maximum size for corporations means that nullsec groups can then increase the number of duplicates when a single set controlled by the holding corp of an alliance would be far more useful to a member of any alliance regardless of whether they live in wormholes nullsec lowsec or highsec ccp has said in the past they plan on changing corp management as a whole in a few years but perhaps that could be fasttracked since making the social aspect of eve intuitive logical and useful encourages more gameplay capital power projection has been nerfed both in range and time it takes more time and more jumps for a capital to go anywhere without the additional changes to sovereignty mechanics and structures nullsec since phoebe doesnt seem to have had any increase in sov warfare its as stagnant as it was before if not more so though congrats to the neutrals who managed to freeport some systems in regard to the expected changes im not sure how occupancybased nullsec does anything but encourage renter alliances protected by the pvpalliances who control them sov structure changes may enable more border fighting and changes though and i look forward to those patch notes other topics sentry drone scan resolution nerf to ishtars cloaks ended up not being changed cloaky camping seems to be less of a problem than last year but maybe thatUFFFDs just because plex prices are too high to keep a toon camping for weeks at a time cloaks could still be tweaked perhaps as part of the ongoing module tiericide so that they provide more and different options of how to fly ships rather than just what you can fly with them players still deserve killmails for all anchorable units that they kill the only ones that they donUFFFDt get credit for mobile warp disruptors expanding the ingame information on killmails to include useful data such as damage over time charts time to kill eg from first pvp timer initiation on killed player up until shippod death adding logistics to killmails etc when it comes to logistics being on killmails if we participate in a fight and gain an aggression timer why not award us a killmail recognition for the similar hard work that our dps brothers and sisters did if you cut us do we not bleed as a logi pilot iUFFFDll admit iUFFFDm biased on this topic the new crest api system shows a lot of promise and sitting in on a thirdparty developer discussion at eve vegas 2014 made me more excited for the future of it and its usefulness within eve continuing to release parts of what it can do should encourage a lot of the current and new applications popping up for everyone to use like seat while i may have been one of the few players who used the industrial teams ccp took an interesting step in removing them from the game rather than leaving them for the usage minority from my nullsec perspective the bounty and kill right systems could benefit from changes most players donUFFFDt seem to hunt via either systems but benefit from the bounty or activate the rights as they stumble upon someone ccp recently changed the rules for some mobile structures so that players only gained a suspect timer for shooting them iUFFFDd like to see this extended to more structures the last change that i can remember to implants was just in how they were obtained ie increasing availability and lowering costs for some but not all of the mindlink implants it would be nice to see more changes that encourage the use of them pilots may no longer need to worry about losing skills with their pod losses but implants donUFFFDt dropand iUFFFDm sure iUFFFDm not the only corpse collector hoping for the day when i can salvage the bodies for random implant drops encounter surveillance systems esses theyUFFFDre nice and they provide some interesting content when an enemy interceptor comes into system but pirate faction ess units would provide more content in both the short and longterm as well as break some of the regional holds on factionspecific ships tldr  i want to see boring stagnant and unused things change without becoming broken or worse than they were im not a conspiracy theorist i live in nullsec i like the taste of blueberry donuts
following my interview with cap stable i thought more on the utility of being able to save and reuse structure layouts for planetary interaction being able to share these layouts between players would be remarkable and turn an activity normally left to the individual into one that is a bit more sociala similar mechanism for pos modules would be as useful and likely used more poses are designed for their purpose just like ships saving module positions relative to the tower location and then using the mechanic to place the same numbertype of modules on another pos serves a common need however the modules should only be placed as unanchored leaving it to the player still to anchor and online the modules individually i recognize that ccp has existing issues related to the pos code and rewriting it but perhaps this feature which ive only spoken to wormhole and nullsec players about so far could be added to the game without complications from the existing code also being able to share these pos plans on a corporate level rather than a personal one would make sense as poses are owned and controlled by corporate rolesmy campaign is officially endorsed by eveskunk
where do i vote  i agree that most of these proposed things need improvementabout the capital travel nerf ccp managed to nerf the massive power projection of swarms of slowcats and mountains of titans and supers but in the same time also destroyed the ability of small groups to use those said capitalsand same jump range for all ships is boring and dumbeve is and has always about choices now theres no choice you jump you wait endwell pretty much like the new interface icons all gray and boring for some strange reason ccp is heading toward making everything the same in all latest patches game becomes more and more boring 
as you seem to be running a very nullsec focused campaign im going to ask you the followingif you could only change one thing from each of the other areas of space  lowsec highsec and wormhole space  what would you choose to focus on and why what part of these areas of space need the most attention from ccp and help from the csm
to answer the first question highsec kill rights no longer expire why does your desire for revenge end after 30 days no lowsec additional lowsectolowsec direct connection wormholes with much shorter lifetimes why pvp opportunities between more than just you and your neighbors or random visitors to your constellation id be interested in faction warfare pilots view on it wormholes tutorial missions for new players which shows them how to find wormholes and in brief explains the benefitshazards my suggestion would be a frigatesized wormhole signature connecting a system a few jumps away with the agent system and the signature only being scannableuseable by the new player to discourage exploits a civilian scan probe launcher  civilian scan probes wouldnt take much skill but could encourage injection of the astrometrics skill book why so new players have an ingame tutorial on how to find wormholes and the basics on what they can doto answer your second question on what needs the most attention from ccp id have to say that i think corp management needs updated the most as it affects everyone regardless of where they live unless they live in an npc corp sure ceos and directors work around and with the current system but its a mess with odd limitations and vulnerabilities i learned it through trial and error over my first two years playingwhat needs the most help from the csm everything if something is an issue for players its our job to tell our elected representatives and its their job to put pressure on ccp to change and hopefully improve on the mechanic in questionto give a more regionalbased answer id like to see nullsec sov changes finished in a way that discourages stagnation while still being the fields from which capital and supercapital fleets are grown and then killed i miss the big battles and it saddens me to think that they may not happen againlowsec is by virtue of its physical geography a patchwork of systems spread throughout highsec id like to say its overlooked as much as wormhole space but now we have new wormhole space more space but not more players is my assumptionthera may be popular with pilots already familiar with wormholes but how many characters ever ventured into a wormhole before they were three months old ive had wormhole friends comment on how dead nullsec is when they roam through it and theyre partly rightwith fewer players in the game that means fewer residents everywhereincluding nullsec bittervets unsubbing or just growing up and getting busy with real life the game needs to be enjoyable for current players but not have such a steep learning curvethanks for the questions
i have flown with alyxportur for several years as a member of kadeshi he is steady and reliable he always was there to help i believe he has the time and energy to be an excellent csm
what are your thoughts on account shared supers should it be allowed and if a account shared super or titan is lost by the person borrowing it like say for a drive by doomsday with out a out cyno should ccp do anything about it or was it just a risk of account charing and nothing more
hello alli would like to let everyone know that i will be placing my name in for csm x this is the first year that i run an alliance as exec but i bring a lot of years in eve to the table i always tried to listen to the needs and concerns that most players in eve have and i want to be able to make these voices of eve pilots heardwho am i you askim a veteran with over 10 years of experience in eve more sov space than any other area i have lived in every region in the game and have seen and been apart of most coalitions i understand the needs and wants of most pilots in eve and the changes we all desire to happen in the gamei am the current exec of skeleton crew alliance and n3 coalition  i got quite accustomed to newer players and see the potential in taking care of and teaching them with respect without looking down on themwe are at a point in this game where people need to stand up and make sure that the new incoming players are more taken care of as well as making sure veterans are not forgotten they are the players who can keep this game playing on and we need to start looking at them more than we have been i tried to help players for years in eve with my own isk and assets to make sure that everyone i talk to isnt in need of anythingi want to be a csm who is known for helping the players in the game as much as possible cares about the needs and concerns of each pilot carries the torch of all players choices and ideas talks to everyday players in eve and not forget who they are like most ex csms have done in the past after election bring more and fair content to the game if possible fair content is where there are not 1000 vs 1000 every time and the tidi becomes so bad that you cant even enjoy the large scale fightsi am not here because i think i am better than anyone but because i want to be everyones voice from brand new players to 12 year veteransso please when time comes elect me to be your voice as csm x memberthank youonly endorsements not negative feed back pleasepantsufan army exec

known pants for a long time and i strongly endorse his ass to be csm
ive been playing with pantsufan only for a month now and i have never met someone who is as passionate about eve online its gameplay and mechanicshe has helped me and my corp adapt to null sec large scale pvp and has been very understanding when me or my corp mates have made a mistake or two nd took the time to explain why what we did was wrong and how we can improve our gamei will endorse him and i look forward to flying with him for the future too
on one hand great a vet who has alot of experienceone the other if we really elect somebody called pantsufan can we really claim to be a mature gaming community anymore
i endorse because he paid me to do so
pantsufan is a player with passion and loves green killboards
how many endorsements from your line members did you demand before they can rat with out a fc also serious question how do you feel about the null sec meta with huge amounts of space being rented out to alliances that dont want to do anything other rat mine build supers and claim to be part of major coalitions is that what you want null to be also if ccp wanted to add a new tutorial and asked the csm for suggestion what would you say the tutorial should cover
given your history of flying off the handle at your own members when they behave in ways that you disapprove of see eveskunk how do you intend to be a productive member of a group of players from diverse backgrounds that will likely have very different opinions on what eves key objectives for the coming year are
i have been flying with pantsufan since around november of 2014 and over all he is a good guy he values his player base and our opinions unlike some of the other people i have flown with in the past is he perfect you might ask and the answer is no there isnt one of us that is in my honest opinion does he learn from mistakes made and continue to get support from his player base  yes he very much does and his passion for keeping eve alive keeps me logging in day after to reach out to new bros to teach this is what makes him different at least in my eyes from the majority of eve playerspants like myself is a firm believer in building relationships with those pilots he flies with inside and outside of eve this is what keeps me and mine around this alliance pants you have my endorsement and any way i can help you to achieve this goal of csm i will do my best to be there helpingsincerelydgsix kado
what will you do on the csm that means you can represent null sec blocks better than manny sion or hell god forbid even sort dragon also since i am quite familiar with the way you manage your alliance thanks eveskunk how would you defend against the accusation that you are in fact completely incompetent
cut ratting privileges until enough people pile in to defend him for these accusations while never acknowledging them himself also remember that he doesnt want any negative feedback
historical context for my question your previous alliance also called skeleton crew ref
hello as a former member of skeleton crew i will say that pants has done rather well to get where he is but behind all the fun and games you see above using currrent members to endorse him its rather different i was on the leadership in skelly and its no fun place evey little structure and when you try and bring up some issues pants will just sweep it under the carpet also new members that would join the alliance with out any checks would instantly be put in leadership positions with out meetings with current leadership about them sadly i would not want him on the csm because his tendancy to fly off the handle and not listen to people and a key role of a csm member is to be able to listen
as far as the accusations that i am an incompetent leader are untrue and i know i do things differently than most execs i have done somethings wrong ratting stuff  and other silly mistakes everyone makes but i have learned from those experiences and grown more into the leader that i shouldve started out to be i know that manny sion and sort are great guys in this well respected and i have much respect for them as well sort has taught me a lot of things about how to run a successful alliance and become a better leader i am glad that i have learned so much from him this campaign is for something that i feel i can bring diversely to the table and be more bias than most people can be i am not running a large alliance or coalition so i see what the basic players are wanting and i want to be a voice for themas for jaakjaaks statement i will only offer factual information about how your corporation only wanted to harm allies in our current coalition every person has a path they choose in the game you and your guys choose a path that wasnt about the growth within our current coalition so yes i made a change to the leadership structure after listening to your version of plans based off of you and your corporations statements about our coalition mates i picked someone who had a cool head has built successful relationships in his past and is a well respected member among his fellow alliance mateslast i have never offered or paid anyone in my alliance or any associates of mine to post on here as each of them support this decision to become a voice for the new players in eve onlinethankspantsufanU200Fpantsufan army exec
from my experience a new tutorial explaining how to correctly use the fleet tool would be most useful most new players do not even know what it is or why they should use it combat is not covered and can empower the new players to achieve more things in this game it would also be nice to see a tutorial explaining how to correctly setup and utilize the overviewpantsufan army exec
im happy for pants focus on basic players and if he wishes to become a csm member that being said i am here to provide factual information regarding his willingness to listen to his leadership i am a retired admiral of skeleton crewi resigned myself i was not removed to commit to piracy because of situations inside skeletoncrew but to the point he is unwilling to listen to his own alliance over his affiliation with n3 his current endorsements come from his own newly appointed leadership asfar as accusing the corporation he mentioned earlier when they resigned from his alliance they walked away and let them be that being said they are pirates now if this csm candidate is willing to learn from his mistakes and listen to the people he claims to represent perhaps he might get elected in the next csm but as for now i as an eve player have stated my peace and why i believe you should think before voting for pantsufan this csm electionmy apologizes negative but clean
i have been in a leadership command for almost all of the alliances and coalitions pantsufan has been the leader of and ive been flying with him for over 6 years with that being said he does listen to leadership and always takes our views into account however he is the exec of the alliance therefore the decision will ultimately rest on his shoulders furthermore he has always kept the players in the alliance as top priority in regards to keeping everyone happy
why do they assume we all want a standard bed either i want a huge 12 person spinning circular bed you never know when youre gonna need an orgy
what is the best part of the jump fatigue change is ita smaller alliances being able to finally use their capital ships without a 910 chance of being dropped by a larger forceb aforementioned larger force crying for 8 pages because they cant hotdrop a drake with 50 pilots through a bridge
i think its a good idea sloppily put  i like corebloodbrothers idea of same region no fatigue
to fill in a little detail its not really evelopedia as a whole its things like the item database thats embedded in it for things like the chronicles it serves a very good purpose
often the community reads the minutes from these summits quiet sometime after the event so thanks for the speed in getting these minutes outbut what id like to know is thisobviously there is some sort of an agenda prepared by ccp in advance of the summit taking place for example day 1agendaUF0B7 roadmap  release cadenceUF0B7 new player experienceUF0B7 web teamUF0B7 team size mattersUF0B7 corporations  alliancesUF0B7 team homegrownUF0B7 team securityi know items on it could change as need be  yes somethings may well be under nda but would it be possible for the proposed agendaoutline for these summits be released to the community  say a week in advance of the summits taking place this would allow the community time to contact our csm representitives in advance of these meetings to raise with them any specific issues  points of concern or interests that we may want the csm to constructively  directly raise with ccp at the upcoming summit
the csm then proposed adding hats to the game  seriouslymore seriously i really hope we are going to see some action on the impersonation clause in the next 3 days its still hanging about the eula like a dead woodchuck under the porch the last time i can find it mentioned in the minutes it seemed the then csm rightly said it should go but nothing has changed
hats make me happy i dont want them personally but its clothing and csm support of clothing is excellent imo
audio recordings of the summit are also being created if long form minutes are needed for a session that creates controversy right
twitch
so nothing constructive to add at the moment but i am cuirous about the last bit of the reportinstead of detailed minutes for this session please find below a recepie for slow cookedchilli provided by our resident cooking instructor steve ronukentexans please avert your eyes and do not read furtherim from louisiana myself and have lived in texas for the better part of a decade im curious why texans would want to avert their eyes from the recipe as besides the amount of beans used looks pretty darn good though admittedly that might be my cajun flare speaking a bit due to the amount of seasoning used
it could be a mystery maybe the recipe is opsec for some chili artists in the know orok as a texan it is actually immediately obvious to me but i would be betraying the republic by telling you
remove attributes  make them flat  yes remove learning implants  no 1 this would make pod death worthless 2 reduced value of higsec fw lp stores  those implants provide basic income for many players3 removed player interaction   people need to haul them around  some hunt for people hauling them  people trade them 4 remove of very important isk sink can someone from ccp tell us how much isk they remove from game each month you need to pay isk to get them from lp store is this blocking pvpyes  but removing cost of clone upgrade already solved many issues for old players implants should be additionally enhanced to help new players while at the same time not providing any significant boost to older players lets just assume that they provide additional skill hardwiringfor example alimited memory  boosts caldari frigate to level 4 light missiles to level 4b full limited set provides  additional boost to engineering if someone already have those skills he get nothing but if new player install those it will get big bonus for the first weeks this bonus is of course not permanent  and you need to train those skills up even when you have those implants
we had to wait far too long cant you just stream the summit with a minute delay to censor any nipple slips or vulgaritieseven the minutes switched to a new release cycle giving us small updates instead of one big pile of text 
very dissapointed in the section describing alliance logos
there was a features and ideas thread about learning implants the short version of my conclusion after chewing on that thread was make jump cloning within the same station zerocooldown that way you can maintain a learning clone and a pvp clone implants should not be removed for the reason of gameplay for people who collect them
i also suggested this some time ago this solves more than issue we are currently facing give players ability to have 20 or more clones but they can be stored only in 2 locations to jump between them you need to use your jump timer  but when you want to exchange clones on station you are docked instead of this you can pay 5 or 10 mil just for instant clone changing 2 stations tons of clones in there but jumping clone from 3rd location destroys this clone
mind blown on meeting minutes delay this timei think the evilopedia is awesome with loads of info and the search feature works much better than in these forums where only single keyword searches seem to work for most forum searching i have to go to evesearch please overhaul the mail client evegate and ingame search in there is needed id like table support tooor contract it out to an external mail provider that will add some minimal crest integration where the wheel is already invented so we can have rich formatting migrate user data and give all players an account there character nameeveonlineexternal provider name
lifting the station limit of 1 jump clone was another part of my conclusion but the current limit is ok with a nil timer
nopevideo which makes life easier with refering the presentations we get
hey quick question what would be the benefit of checkboxing a society to secret
the ingredients of the recipe should be trade items
i think mostly its to keep the list in check
and who doesnt want to be a member of a secret societymmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
as far as the removal of attributes so a players will not be locked in to a slow train of skills eve is hard and that is apart on why its fun unlike other games eve is real when i started playing i didnt know how much i would grow up in 3 years a lot of it was due to screwing up my attributes 3 times lol but i knew what i wanted to do in eve and i think im pretty good at it so no i dont think its a good idea to remove it but have a better guide for it in some way still keeps the ability to screw it up also really liked that the lachesis has 4 lows and now that ive played with the fit not having the hac resists are ok the pilgrim feels a bit weaker then it should be by a hair my need a look at but the reason im saying it here is i like that the feedback from players and devs were fast and were heard and the changes with the new releases are nice i think a lot of players like it and some miss the old way where there were climactic videos about them
i see you covered skins already but no mention was made of what people think of the mechanic of how they are applied to your character versus being an item that blows updropsetc from the ships themselvestheres a very lively discussion that ccp stopped participating in over in the thread discussing skins once we asked why they arent fittings on shipshow about the csm represents this a little bit more for us players wanting to know whyi dont judge people by their race religion color size age gender or ethnicity i judge them by their grammar spelling syntax punctuation clarity of expression and logical consistency
i endorse this message and early csm minutes regards a freelancer
there is a potential danger herein the future aurum could become part of the cost to manufacture or acquire ingame items that do not currently use auruma nice way to circumvent current ingame items and associated costs is to rebalance them including naming in the futureorin the future aurum will become a timebased currency in that it can be obtained from certain missions added to the bounty system or tied into factional warfare and it then can fall under player manipulation like the plex market which ccp confirmed as happening just like any other item in game
if its for something which has an in game mechanics effect cosmetic doesnt count it will not be sold for aurum
i agree removing attributes is a good idea and it also removes any possibility for ccp to one day sell neural remaps for aurumsource plex for neural remaps a possibility againalso one reason for using player appointed attribute points is to give the player a sense of control over their character and hisher development and forces them to make decisions about where to spend themremoving attributes from skill training time helps both new players and vets who fly in nullwh space
if ccp wants more players then they need to get serious about a more simple and attractive uimy sister walks into my room as i am playing evesister what are you doingme playing a gamesister thats a game i dont understandme im a spaceship pilotsister wheres the spaceshipme pans the camera in close so that the ship can be seen in the little block of space left that isnt plastered with ui windowssister oh ok im taking the dogs to the river wanna comeme yep

disable it by default and lets see how it goes then
two things you should look at regarding the npe1 map wasd to movement by default having a new player having to map it themselves is confusing and does not help s new player make it the default setting upon eve online installation2 the default overviews need to be better ccp needs to redo their defaults to be more functional also by default all 5 tabs should be used vs the current 1
misquote tickets we get  safety in highsec afk cloakers bumpingoh surprise people are upset about people cloaking and being afk so scary a player who is afk is going to kill me oh noesif we hange that then those who dock and go afk we need to change toounproductive rant
hmm wormhole fine mining should be both anomalies and sigs good proposalthe shattered wormholes need a little something actual loot i know they are still a little under developed atm
you no tell ccp make dark opaque theme bad csm you very bador is maybe something similar
its what i was getting at withgiven contrasting themes thing ill bring it up again when we hear more about that
day 2 seemed to have a lot of good talking about wspace im a bit sad to see that only pve content in wspace was addressed with a short mention of therawhich shouldnt even be considered a wspace system imo how is the current status of wormhole pvp how is the current state of capital fights in wspace has the amount of wspace carriers fighting in ns changed due to the jump changes the minuts are discussing mining pve kills and jumps but it looks like the summit just skipped one of the major concerns of hyperionless capital fights and one of the major concerns of wspace in generalmissing pvp content was this stuff discussed and just left out in the minuts and if so why or was this not discussed at all and if so whythanks a lot for the fast minuts 3  steven 
we did ask minutes arent a transcrip just a summary
thank you very much for typing the minutes ccp logibro source
thanks for the text version this is exactly right imhoi think achievements would be a useful addition
my cruiser team will beat your burner cruiser teams fozzie if you do this youd better make them scaryccp bettik best ccppve and missions its the right type of interaction with the game for people who havent decided on a group to join its also a placeholder  holding pattern activity while players level up their raven in an attempt to make themselves worthy before seeking to join a bigger group the content is stale right now but somehow i think its still enough to keep the occasionallogin players interest it fits in as a minigame while skill queuing i ran level 1 and 2 missions for my first two years just for something to do while offdutythats kind of cool i 1 this as a way of indicating game life in the players vicinity feedback for actions the rate might be similar to jita local but if its important information it is possible for it to capture the players attention like a stock ticker if it announces rulebreaking thats a bit better to interested parties than a relatively mild blinking square in localthe ui plans are not hopeful still failing to assimilate and interpret your own game
id really like it if chat channels had some kind of sound notification of new messages so for example have the sound team create 34 chimes and let us chose which channel we want which chime to play on if we want chimes to play at all
he ccp tomb noted that the npc creation system had essentially not been changed since eve has started however now a new template system has been created streamlining the process considerably this allows a game designer to select a ship hull and fit it with premade attribute setsgoing with the whole dynamic world based idea over instance type model wouldnt it make more sense for npc creation and mechanics to be the exact same as fitting a player ship where random utility slots could produce variations according to the npc type but still using real word modules and whatever is fitted drops as though it were a pvp killthe remaining attributes to fill out would be the blackboard behaviors mentioned earlier defining how they behave and organize to do stuffs blackboard  a blackboard is a way for them to share their intentions with each other they have a shared blackboard where if one of the npcs posts a location or primary target they will behave like a well organised fleet following their fcs commandsonce tweaked the blackboard modeling of npcs can reduce the numbers required for them to be effective and could eliminate the bloat and oddity of killing cores and scores of red crosses in a mining like fashion bounties could be raised and npc farming can more closely simulate normal pvp and create dynamic content at the same time might as well even have them have to hold sov like we do and attack and defend in a similar fashiontalk about dynamic content they could have to mine and defend against those pod pilot rats that keep trying to kill their miners etc etc etcjust sayin
forgot to mention this as part of the above logicccp affinity brought up that no game has really been able to create enough content to keep players engaged over a very long period of time ccp frellicus also added that with a new mission system they would look more at being able to generateconstant dynamic world content rather than just static missions
oh yeah and thisccp affinity asked the csm to let them know if they had ideas to try out with the new behaviour trees corbexx brought up them speaking in local sugar kyle brought up random small events going on in the world such as npc pirates fighting npc faction police in locationsmy earlier post in regards to the blackboard would fall into the behavior trees as well
ccp arrow talked about how the controls for your ship are next in line to be worked on by the teamoohhplease see this
heres something that should of been talked about with team pirate unicorns concerning the new player experience  retention of these playersthe fact that many of these players are getting frustrated with what content is offered to them  how they can achieve a sustainable source of incomeonce players get past the tutorial missions  progress to low level missions they soon find the rewards they can receive from completing these missions are hopelessly out dated in comparison to modern day market prices they might of been fine when eve first started but they are pathetic by todays market standards new players get frustrated from having to go through numerous repetitions of running the same set of missions for a agent over and over again whilst trying to make isk even if they do decide to go to another high sec region and try missions for a different agent of the same type they find that there is still little to no difference in the storyline the objectives or the rewards on offer to complete the missions this creates a barrier for some who dont want wait for their skills to improve sufficently to a point where they feel comfortable with moving out of empire to either low sec or nul sec where the rewards from missions  anoms are much much better so in the end they get bored  frustrated with eve fast  end up leavingthere has to be a way to improve  make the missions each agent offers more unique  immersive as well as improving the rewards on offer for missions so these players dont feel like they are wasting their time and getting nowhere fasta new story line mission idea that might help in opening their eyes to whats possible could be something likefor a 72hr time periodthe npe finds they have been somehow conscripted into an empire navy they see short video of their ship being magically titan bridged to a non player accessible area of low or nul sec where they see themselves docking at a station  they are given a number of prefitted ships together with the skills to fly them they receive a list of objectives from an npc fc that they must attempt to complete the idea behind the tasks is to show off whats on offer in this type of space as they patrol it ideally it should show them the difference in risk vs reward from empire thru to nul sec  also serve as a kind of tutorial for fleet opsit could also give npes chance to actually see a variety of ships like frigates thru to battleships carriers rorquals supers  titans in an ingame enviroment that they might not otherwise get to see if they up  quit evehopefully more dynamic missions in conjunction with a rebalance of mission rewards could serve as a possible means of an improved source of income  provide them with inspiration  drive to set lofty goals of being apart of the low  nul sec communities should they choose to do so whereby they could someday obtain  fly their own copy of the ships they saw out there in their mission
sion then talked about something along the lines of a rotating corporate task list that players could complete and get a reward ccp rise liked the idea and had previously been talking about stuff and had been thinking of the opportunities for corporations to use this tracking system to organize themselves and reward their playersomg this all day yes this would help greatly getting corp stuff done one could argue that contracts can do this but they are a peta and having a dedicated task list has so much more potential
 pvpers earn their isk typically by having to do pve yes but pve uses the skills theyve already trained for pvp rattingdedingincursions an industrialistminer will not have combat skills so they must do what 1 train as a combat pilot first bef
yes google doesbut some sort of tagsystem could clean it up even morespecially if when your creating your post that you had to tag it first and it would bring up a list of post already on that topicthe lord loosed upon them his fierce anger all of his fury and rage he dispatched against them a band of avenging angels  the scriptures book ii apocalypse 101 npclivesmatter freetheboobs
because we need less hot drops and more ratting carriers
actually smallerslower hotdrops will lead to more ratting carriers which will lead to more in total hotdrops
i tackle your carrier in one ship light a cyno 5 guys jump through each one has a cyno 25 guys jump in each one has a cyno 125 guys jump inso its a bad idea but also a bad idea that wouldnt work
31 weaker enemies on the field
theres already jump fatigue why not just make all of eve highsec 
i am in nullwhen i see reds coming on intel channels  know what i doi dock upyup i dock right upthen i undock in a covert ship why being in a covert cloak ship is better than being in a stationeveryone knows it is over powered it needs to change
what thats a horrible argument and who is everyone
try take those sunglasses off and think a bit before you argue so blindly refute the reasons why i prefer a covert ship over a station
because you can get eyes on your enemy so what thats overpowered
again a quick reply with very little thinking and only one benefit or use mentioned
its not my job to list every single way that you think cloaks are overpowered its yours its called your campaign because its yours
already done multiple times in multiple places and multiple times with you is your goal in life to waste peoples time
from here even a goon is not so blind
then clearly your issue is the cyno not the cloak how can you complain about what intel a cloaked ship can gain when you have local as the perfect intel toolwith all do respect youre a pver a miner an industrialists etc and thats fine but it really sounds like youre trying to bring a little too much highsec into my nulllowsec if you have a problem with afk cloakers and cynoswhy not just play in highsecfor you to claim that the mechanic is over powered youd actually have to show some strong stats back when drakes and hurricanes were the ships to fly in 00 there was real stats backing up why they were over powered when every capital fight summoned everyone with a cyno from literally all over new eden you could see that was a game breaking problem even isthars today are a bit of an issue but as far as cloaky ship and hot dropping goes theres no stats backing this up miners arent dying in droves people are still doing their ratting just finehere lets see if you can answer this question for every 10 ratting or mining ships out there flying in a non hs area of eve how many get hot dropped if its such an issue you need to actually back up your argument with some statistics or something because right now it honestly just looks like someone that does pve complaining about someone doing pvp
it is too logically evident to me to believe it needs that effort so counter argument disprove it give me stats on how many hours miners and ratters dont stay docked up move to another system or are playing another game when there is an afk cloaker in their home system
once again i would respectfully remind you that the burden of proof is on you as a csm candidate to prove your point
thats the tldr of their entire post history dude playing the wrong game has rarely fit anyone better
easy solution delay before you can light a cyno after jumping to onebefore you say something cant work stop and ask yourself if you have closed off all of the possibilities if you dont have special training in this field of mental brainstorming work youre probably better off with the simple mantra never say its impossible
perhaps not everyone per se but id figure a large percentage of the pvpers i know who have flown a covert ship would agree to thisperhaps if you had been reading jenshaes posting history youd notice shes come a long way where i once saw a lot of blind hatred toward nullsec i now see a much more informed view jenshae was once a rookie but will perhaps someday be a bitter vet i think you spend too much time assuming people never change and should perhaps check back once in a while before you make accusations about someone that might no longer be true also constructive criticism is always many times more helpful than destructive criticism
the wheel is round no no no i demand you waste your time to do a three year investigation with proof of it rolling down different hills that you find a new way to calculate pi and then prove to me how round it is compared to a squarethat is how absurd this seems to me i must hold onto the hate it is the best tool for channeling my energies and controlling the force seriously though if i end up being one of the csm i need to hold onto a little bit of everything i can confusion indignation and that annoyance that took me to the brink of deleting eve forever are some of the tools to empathise with newbies for examplemaybe ccp should make some innuendo statement such as do not worry it hurts the most the first time but soon you will enjoy it as a pop up when someone dies to another player for the first time
i think this also applies actually there is a pretty simple solution to what seraph believes would happen of exponential cynos  cool down timer before someone that just jumped until they can generate a point for someone to jump to them
cloaked inte gatherer is rare wheres the proof and how is someone who is actually afk going to hurt you i dont see the argument here we are arguing what ifs the afk cloaky camper argument is like arguing with code over ganking if your scared to play because someone is cloaked then he is doing his job
congrats youve just ruined a mechanic completely youll find no one to support this except other carebears by all means go ask literally any 00 nullsec candidate or current csm member since you have special training in the field of mental brainstorming work go on ill waitare most of them in test alliance if its so easy to do as proving the wheel is round surely even you can do that its not a crazy idea to back up your statements with actual facts
i only want a pilot jump limit and recyno delay on covert cynos but thats beside the point i was pointing out that you were being to quick to seal the idea off as not possibly working go ahead and disagree with it or pick out problems with it but you should slow down a bit before dropping accusations that its illconceived from the ground up and couldnt possibly be further balanced to work decently i hope not most of us are able to find ways to die even while cloakedthe burden of proof always lies on the one making an extraordinary claim regardless of political position sourceim not really sure who was making extraordinary claims as i cant really tell what you guys were going on about for sure
if anyone needs local numerical superiority its covert cyno ships that are much less tanky than conventional ships it isnt that i didnt think through the possibilities its that i did and still saw how bad they weresince the current game mechanics are the norm and jen wants to change them id imagine hes making the extraordinary claims when slowcats were rebalanced when blaptitans were rebalanced when drakes and canes were rebalanaced people provided stats to back their argument
i think we are getting away from jens campaign
no need for me to have original thought when i can just add to kaarous cant speak for the rest of the pve community but 1 from this one as well
wow well saidwant to find all the podcasts around eve online visit
not empty quoting
id like to officaly support tora for csm for mercs n pirates everywhere a vote for tora is a vote for content
if you vote for me you vote for content and conflict yes 
added my twitter account to the op  blowfish70 want a fast answer to a question send a twit i read it 247
i removed a reply to an edited out part of the quoted postisd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls
cool i edited my post to add a link to the pic i wanted hendrick to see instead so that it makes sense hopefully that doesnt constitute trying to evade an isd edit or anythingeve down under  a community for players in the autz
i mean all the candidates have great ideas
listened to your interview with capstable youre very well spoken and made your point well 1
oh wow wasnt expecting that to be ready so quickly thanks to the folks at cap stable for both putting up with me and being so quick at posting it
thats yet to be evidenced as true as it stand it looks like conflict wont actually be introduced until they change the way sov is taken and held in an ideal world yes removing jumping will create conflict but in realism its just making people not bother to travel long distances to fight while still leaving the threat that if you attack someone on their home turf they will drop capital fleets on your head just now you cant call in backup from another group its certainly not a conflict driverthat said its secondary to the main point which is that automatically accepting and rejecting changes based purely on whether or not they are thought to increase or decrease conflict respectively is far too simple an idea and certainly not a healthy view for a csm member to take a good idea is still a good idea even if it reduces conflict retaining conflict is definitely something that should be considered but its not the sole factor in a good idea
its yet to be evidenced that the changes will lead to an increase in conflict although judging by my personal sales of ships that are heavily exported to nullsec for fleet warfare specifically ishtars and oneiroses at least one large null bloc believes it will drive dconflicthowever the status quo was going to stifle conflict over time the ability of apex forces to appear in any fleet fight and whelp it unless another larger apex force arrived was going to lead to a protracted cold war which is imo not a healthy situationin a choice between an uncertain future and a clearly bad one id go with uncertainty had i been on csm 9 my feedback for the phoebe changes would have been broadly positive this isnt claiming that they are perfect just that they were better than inaction
while feyd is being a little dogmatic on purpose to highlight the many recent changes to the game that have indeed reduced conflict and therefore content and have made the game more boring his core point is correct  changes to the game should be considered primarily as to whether to promote conflict perhaps i might qualify this as entertaining conflict sure there are some changes that do nothing to change the conflict in the game  reskinning a ship for example and there are other changes to the game where two reasonable people can disagree on whether the net effect will be more conflict or not  like the force projection changes but at its core this game is primarily only interesting because of the direct conflict against or competition with other players you say a good idea is a still a good idea but good is a meaningless term unless you define what you are trying to achieve can you actually name a change to this game that most people consider good but that actually decreased conflict between players because this is a complex game sometimes a change can rebalance conflict or reduce it in one place but increase it elsewhere but i think all the changes to the game considered good by most players have driven conflict overall not reduced it there are many ways to play eve but almost all of them are only interesting because you live in a sandbox with other players carebears can play on the test server and mine and build whatever they want in 100 safety but none of them do this because these activities are meaningless in the absence of the competitive sandbox around you there is no actual use for your goods not to mention no risk so therefore there is no sense of accomplishment conflict between players drives everything in this game and therefore every change to game mechanics should be primarily considered as to whether it increases conflict or not because otherwise the game becomes more boring and people will stop playing if there is no contentconflict to be had
pedro is enlightened in his commentary he gets it both the spirit of the question and of evethe problem is that ccp itself has lost the plot here and in blind pursuit of moar subs have clearly shown with each newly proposed nerf like giving corps a no awoxing switch and social corporations that cannot be wardeccedwtf they are willing to sell their souls to the devil for a quick fix to achieve thatnot achieved through more compelling content not through a better new player experience not through better education of newbros on the realities of eve life when they join no ccp has decided to just turn off aggression in hisec in slow paper cuts so people dont notice over time do we contentcreators just keep assuaging ourselves that this is just another small papercut infringement on our freedoms we can live with it we can just lay low and ride it outafter all we still have ganking as if suicide ganking is the one and only measure of htfu and sandbox we weigh hisec contentcreation bywe are going to wake up one day and realize hisec is a separate nopvp shard of eve online and every csm who should have been guarding against that over the years was asleep at the fcking switch the battle for eves very soul is being waged now but our existing csms and most players arent even showing up to fight carebears cheer in shortsightedness nullbears cry tears that toras guys are murdering them in hisec while claiming l33tness for being in a null alliancewhat we need is more sabriz and tora on the csm and less mike asariah  sugar kyle i submit we dont need more trainedseal clapping applause to ccp nerfing and pansifying eve for the fapping pleasure of wowrejects we need sabriz and tora as counterpoint to those intentions and hold the linef
in response to the suggestions for a halfway house between a player corp and an npc corp because this seems to be a recurring thread and im someone that has a history of nonstandard use of the corporation tools for instance for a long time i was an active supporter of code alliance without being a memberfirstly its my view that outside fw an npc corp is nothing but the absence of a player corporation this is mainly because you have no control over which npc corp you wind up in except for a decision you make before creating your character the functionality of the proposed corp lite is really the same as the minerbumping chat channel in game a moderated chat channel except that a corp lite would exclude people who are members of traditional player corps joining unless they are willing to leave their real corpthis would allow someone interested in two or more activities to connect with other players and still make their own decision about whether to be in a player corp or not rather than having to commit to a corp or corplite that specialises in only one of those activitiesthere are benefits to making it easier to find other players with similar interests  but this should be done through improving and publicizing chat channels not through reducing the consequences of corp membership in particular it should be easier to find chat channels aimed at an activity you are interested in lots of channels exist  some are secret others are open but just very hard to find out about some are well known the minerbumping channel for example or whatever replaced the haulers channel after the original one changed ownership and others are set up by ccp the mining or recruitment channel
this is pretty far off what is currently being proposed and discussed by the csm page 16 of the day 1 minutes speaks more about this subject i recommend you give it a look iot familiarize yourself
you mention in your capstable interview that people over the last 18 months have been leaving c1 to c5 to go to run incursions could you provide some more info on these numbers facts that sort of thingyou mention that the corp on corp change will be a huge detriment to w space since they will all move to hisec and run incursion if this was the case they would just do incursions in a npc so this change wouldnt effect them in anywaycould you give me a bit more info on how you think w space is doing its obviously going badly as you saydo you honestly think the corp on corp agression will totally ruin w spaceyou mention that you heavily endorsed funkybacon how do you think he has done this year
sabriz how would you feel about having a channel advertisement system similar to the corporation advertisements as a follow up how would you feel about seeing corporation advertisements on in game billboards and on the big screen in the captains quarters the what thats a thing i never go there
i just reread it the social groupsocieties functionality in the minutes is something more in line with the minerbumping channel but with improved features mailing list fleet finder etc thats fine as it doesnt really compete with or interact with the corporation function thats quite different to a lot of the corp lite proposals that have been made independently of the csm which are for corporations with immunity to wardecs and friendly fire and with no rights to anchor structures that idea would actively harm the game by reducing conflict drivers
firstly the only evidence i have as to the state of wh space is annecdotal from my own visits there from information from corp thieves that prey on wormholers and the like everyone ive spoken to indicates that c1 to c3 holes are quieter than they used to be without having had any major mechanical changes c4s are quieter although they have also seen mechanical changes that make them harder to defend c5c6 cap esc fleet whelps tend to be big enough news to get an article on eve sites and these articles are becoming less commonim confident that this annecdotal evidence is sufficient to say that wh space is presently in a decline that is neither at nor near crisis proportions and c6 holes are somewhat insulated for players that use game theoretical methods to balance risk and reward to optimize returns immunity to awox predation is another factor pulling them toward highsec mission andor incursion grinding at the expense of wormhole pve its not clear if this is the tipping point or if the actual tipping point will be another future change to highsec safety but the single most viable way to kill marauders in highsec just disappeared from the gamei dont claim that large numbers will move out of wormholes on day 1 or that everyone will abandon wormholes over time but the prevailing wisdom among pve players will shift over time in favor of running multiple accounts grinding incursions or missions in high rather than running a smaller number of accounts running wormhole pve reduce the number of prey and you will reduce the viabiltiy of predators  just look at the mess nonfw lowsec is in if you want to see what happens to space when for a long period of time it offers little to incentivise preysome people will of course ignore any changes to the prevailing wisdom and will act in a game theoretically incorrect way due to their personal preference just as some people continue to grind missions in dodixie 920 rather than the optimal approach of doing missions for the sisters these people might be enough to sustain an ecosystem in wormholes time will tellas for incursion runners in singleplayer or npc corps  i consider this a serious issue that needs fixing and have proposals that would rebalance incursions payouts to make fielding a single corporation fleet and possibly defending it from hostiles viable

thank you ezwal 1
it might have been nice if the part where i actually asked a question about smallgang had stuck aroundto paraphrase it sounds like jayne sees small gang as a state of mind containing less in the way of dedicated support ships and probably more in the way of ships that could fight reasonably on their own but fight better in a group does that sound right
nailed it
i think thats the sort of vagueness that im finding issue with small gang being a state of mind is wishy washy up in the air nonsense does that mean i can roll around with 500 zealots but as long as my state of mind is small gang than it is soif the concept is so relative as personal perspective how can you even begin to address any of the issues presented i mean you cant even pin down the fundamental definition about the concept let alone improve on it youre just agreeing with whatever ranamar said

23 years from now at that point i feel its reasonable to assume that corporation and alliance mechanics have been completely overhauled and the sovereignty warfare redesign has been completed as well  which would have been my focus if the items in my platform were brought to a point where they could no longer be improved upon what i would focus on after all of these things are completely done and perfected would be wardecs although you could consider this to be a part of the corporation and alliance mechanics i doubt itll receive the proper attention during the current development roadmapi dont feel that there are enough highsec corporations and alliances that operate and compete with one another exclusively in highsec and i blame this entirely on the current wardec system highsec will be in a good place imho when the same depth of conflict competition and narrative can be seen in highsec as can be seen in sov null allowing player run groups in highsec to form empires and encouraging them to compete with one another is extremely important to me and will do wonders to improve the health of the game take the money and say welcome to eve  real talk tho money should never be the root incentive for people to help players  just putting that out thereanyway the one thing about new players that frustrates me is that they dont know enough about the sandbox to know what theyre going to enjoy in the sandbox this is partly why it irritates me that people are so quick to encourage new players to join groups like brave newbies  not that bni isnt a wonderful group and has a lot of systems in place to help new players  but that people are pigeonholing these new players into sov nullsec which many consider to be the least fun part of the sandboxif i were to have three days with a newbro id show them as many different parts of the game world as i could take them wormhole diving try and fight fw plexers gank a few miners run a few mission show them the depth of the game and let them decide where they want to set up camp and thrive within the sandbox to this end euni does a great job and after the 3 days id recommend the new player go there until theyve found themselves you would think this comes with a rather complicated answer but its really quite simplein ccp seagulls keynote speech she discussed designing for unintended consequences within new eden saying that if we can predict what is going to happen the players can predict whats going to happen  and the players are smarter than usthe playerbase is extremely intelligent the bloggers are outspoken and knowledgeable and the subreddit and news sites allow for both discussion and dissemination of information in a situation where there is a controversy regarding a change to the game  or anything really  its important to make sure that constructive discussion is taking place and that the community knows whats happening and why regardless of whether or not i agree with a controversial change its the csms job to represent the players that means facilitating the discussion within the playerbase correcting any misunderstandings and taking that feedback to ccp
the pointyour headplease stop trying to get senpais approval
offline pos towers are a menace to all security levels of spacethe amount of offline pos structures that can be found in all corners of highsec space alone can be annoying to any pilot wanting to throw down their own tenti think this is one of the important issue that needs to be discussed with ccp this is easily in my top 5
share your ideas about updating combat boosters and what you would do to make them a bigger part of eve
vic came into my home system yesterday just to campaign his ideas even though we dont get along in game all to frequently  but his ideas i believe are spot on and taking the time to respond to everyone who has questions just shows dedication that is needed in a csm member i am tres pein and i support this message
grrr goons grrr goons you are adopted and nobody loves you sorry had to say something negative before i can give him a positive as much as it pains me to say this ill vote for you i think generating content for systems other then high sec will bring lots of fun into the game i also agree that the systems we base out of for the risk dont generate as much isk as they should we have brawls with these boys all the time and i dont think he is pushing for things that only benefit his alliance more content is a win in my book
just for crits interview
other orgs cant even fathom the possibility of one of their rookies running for csm
haha i can only hope
i have only know pants for a short period of time however on behalf of jpeg i would be honored to endorse his candidacy we came to this alliance only a few months ago after folding our corp for a couple of years since coming here i have watched pants turn what was a pretty fail alliance when we got here into what is becoming a very respectable pvp alliance he has a very competent leadership style and will be a strong voice for all parts of eve especially for the smaller alliances whose concerns are different than some of the larger blocks he will bring a balanced viewpoint to the csm and not always side with the big alliances pants is his own man and he has my respect which does not come easilygive him your vote and you will not be disappointed0aruthaceo jian products engineering group
in response to several items anyone knows me in our out of game knows i do what i want when i wantpoint 1skelly leadership being forced or asked to help with positive feedbacki do not as a general practice speak or give opinions on players publicly as a part of skeleton crew leadership i have not received anything more than a notice that pants was running for csm nothing more to my knowledge he has not asked one person within the alliance to help with his candidacy in anyway point 2 flying of the handle at players is not a disqualification for csm two names should sum this up progodledgend sort dragon point 3 i do not have personal first hand knowledge of what transpired in pantsu fans previous alliances i do know that quite a few of the pilots that got scammed lost their stuff ect are flying with him again i am sure there are those who are still bitter point 4 i think pants does listen he just does not try to keep everyone happy just because you tell him something does not mean he has to or even needs to follow it up he is very passionate he is one of the few leaders who have stepped up to help make content he is striving to make a difference that passion inspires mewhy would i think he would make a good csm his passion for the game and his stubbornness will give him that standpoint of not going with the flow just because it is flowing i do not think he will go with popular opinion just because it is the popular opinion is pants the perfect candidate no none of them are i do think he is better than average person running
1 to pantsufanhe is a very kind manhe cares peoples need whathe loves help people
i endorse pants on this he will represent nullsec players well
removed some off topic posts
i figured what the heckgreetings alli have decided to throw my hat into the ring for csm x im not going to make any random promises that i know i have no power to do but i figured i should tell you all why you should vote for meim a near 11 year vet of eve came here from another game earth and beyond and have not lefti have ran two alliances lived in hs ls null and wspace i have been an alliance head and diplomat as well as a line man for one of the first alliances in eve ascn with that said my expertise falls in the following categoriescorp and alliances management recruitment etcposs setting up running defending fueling and losingand miningthings im not an expert in but can do consist ofwormholesindustrymissionsexplorationsov warfarethings i mmm suck inpvpmy main goals as a csm is to represent the all around player small corps and alliances but mostly miners i think the mining mechanic and game play has plenty of room for improvements and id love to see it get some love mining was the things that got me hooked on eve nearly 11 years ago and i think its high time it got a bit more then just polish mining could be improved by adding new game play elements such as comet mining ring mining and making moon mining into an active mining feature as opposed to the passive mining it is now this would be done by removing all moon goo from moons and placing them in comets as well as new ring mining locations in addition the rorq should gain new abilities and become more of a capital mining platform and flag ship for large mining fleetspos should become more like the old module pos idea form a few years ago and more like mini stationsso ama
never mined in my life but i think having someone that can focus on the backbone of all industry would be extremely helpful
im a long shot but i figured i might as well try and well mining really does need some love it has not changed much in a long time
why does it matter if hes amarr fw
not wishing to derail the thread too much it is a question of soft poweri always enjoy reading your articles seraph its a shame you dont discuss low sec much you know that wars are not won by pilot skill and military might alone my question is what is md offering as an agenda for faction warfare and low sec that would make minnie militia pilots vote for him despite the assumed downsides of an amarr representative being on csm for usnamely1 amarr militia having a direct advocate with the devs2 amarr militia gaining more publicity from a successful election campaign presumably boosting their recruitment3 amarr militia having the opportunity to lobby for issues that may influence our warzones little ecosystem in their favour and by definition to minni militias disadvantage4 all the reasons why cfc pilots are unlikely to pick an ncdot candidate as their first choice and vice versain summary what is mds election platform is he representing the interests of amarr militia or fw in general if fw in general what would md say to any tlf pilots who may be turned off voting for him due to his faction allegiance
what possible solutions do you see to get new players out to nullsec quicker
as i said above wormholeselaborating on that i think newbros dont get out to nullsec because they think its too dangerous for them they dont know anyone out there its too far away from their homebase if the constant gatecamps in hedgp are anything to go by gates between losec and nullsec are popular camping grounds encouraging  teaching them how to use wormholes early on takes care of problems 3  4 solving problem 1 would require some prodding such as a hisec mission that requires them to get a sample of arkanor or spodumain from nullsec thus showing them they can survive long enough to swipe some valuables if theyre careful that encourages them to visit nullsec through wormholes whenever they feel daring problem 2 is solved with a mixture of active newbro recruitment by nullsec coalitions and the organic process of attackers chatting you up after they explode your t1 frigate for trespassing
fixed that for youim always interested in supporting new players as ive said elsewhere i ask questions less to get answers and more to see how candidates think sohave you seen ccp rises presentation on a tentative new approach to the npe if not i highly recommend it especially as background for the dev blog that the justpublished minutes advertise as forthcominghow does this approach strike you if asked for feedback as a csm what would you sayagain im more interested in your thinking aloud than in answers i expect answers to change in light of newer and better information than ccp makes public

well i had the 2nd part of this written up and accidently forceclosed the window which means its now time for the ultracompact hopefullycomplete too longdidnt post versionthe emphasis on planets reminded me of how much work it was for me to set up my efficient pi chains which is probably not what you want for a system thats great for providing newbros cheap isk instead of forcing players to haul out a command center in an industrial why not just have them pay the customs office x amount of isk to establish one on the planet belowi also want a way to simplify setting up the pis like automatically filling out routes if theres only one link connected to an extractor odds are the resources are going down it and providing charts of what builds into what i personally jotted down notes on several sheets of grid paper figuring that all out ill admit that was probably a tad overboarddiscussion of wasd space travel and doubleclicking in space made me realize i want a line showing my path to show up when i click on a destination like that this led to thinking about how unwieldy the current orbiting mechanic is and how nice itd be if it displayed your orbit and its angle and then let you tweak your trajectory into orbitid also like it if collision spheres could be displayed stupid asteroidspermadeath scares me but after listening to his explanation of its mechanics im beginning to come around on itas for my opinion on their proposed path for improving the game for newbros i wholeheartedly approve it sounds like they have a good idea how they want to improve it yet are doing enough testing to make sure its actually working if anything id say they arent shooting high enough yet i want to see opportunities concerning pi faction warfare and wormholes as wella tad more concise than i originally planned but its getting late here and i need to crash for the night hopefully that answers your questions
yes that is a humongous barrier to newbros getting out of hisec and into lowsecnullsec if brave had gamblers wed probably put the odds of a newbro successfully surviving the trip from hisec to catch in a ship that isnt a travel inty at 1in15 its even sadder when the newbros themselves dont realize how dangerous it is and it takes me 5 minutes of flailing my arms and shouting stop for them to realize that making the trip in a cruiser they spent all their isk on is not the best ideathe early plethora of rewards newbros get from the tutorials is also an issue as it gives them stuff that ties them to their starting system right off the bat that makes it extremely hard to convince them to restation themselves well anywhere else ive talked about 12 newbros through moving from hisec to catch and 10 of those times involved a conversation along these linesalright first you should sell everything you have no dont panic its not actually that much no 3 million isk is not a lot of money just calm down you can buy all that stuff out here no dont try to fly it all out here youll lose it for sure look theres these things called gatecampsin addition to emphasizing the use of wormholes to go to lowsecnullsec it might be nice if the tutorial gave you coupons you could redeem at any timestation later for the modulesships rather than automatically delivering them to your starting station that would keep newbros less tied to their starting station and hisec in general encouraging them to explore and welp rookie ships more oftenactually as i ponder welping rookie ships and how often i welped in my first week of playing i think the best reward for completing the initial tutorialopportunities would be unlimited t1 shipsmodules to welp for a week it would be difficult to make it so people couldnt exploit that to flood the market but i think that would encourage the kind of reckless abandon and experimentation newbros need to try everything the sandbox has to offer and start finding out what they likeon second thought it wouldnt be that difficult ccp would just have to treat it more like other mmos respawn systems than eves usual die and lose all your stuff process attempts to get rich off exploiting the constant replacement could be stymied with these 2 mechanics your replacement ship is exactly the same as the ship you lost filled with rigs and modules theyre all there completely empty because you soldstripped all your modules your replacement ship is empty too everything on the ship is destroyed along with the ship itself rather than some of it being lootable this prevents people from having a friend blow them up and splitting the profits from selling the reimbursed modules not sure how much extra coding that would involve or how much that would break players immersion in the game but i definitely think a period of reckless abandon for new players starting out would be useful for getting them to experiment explore and find their niche rather than settling into the comfortable riskaverse rut of earning isk from hisec missions
i dont fatigue is fatigue it should be a simple specific rule set you jump you get fatigue no buts afterand i personally cant wait for more nullsec changes and the eventual removalnerf of the jfetc fatigue bonuses
except that idea leaves anyone who lives on the regional borders being shat on from two sides entities that live further into the region can simply drop whenever they want just like the old times and the guys on the other side of the border just jump up to the line and step acrossit ensures that each region has one and only one power bloc living in it and noone else can get a foothold
start fleet on far side of region a fatigue  zerocyno jump right across region a to the gate to region b no fatiguejump through gate to region b cyno jump right across region b to the gate to region c no fatiguearrive in region z with no jump fatigue
wormholes please do so it isnt just new players that need it there is allot of older players as well that would benefit from it too ui modernization projectfor the love of god please increase the maximum number of ship fittings in the fitting management window also please increase the maximum number of in game mails that you can trashdelete at a single time customer supporti think its pretty obvious that the whole petition ticket system needs to be better explained to players  expanded onoften players are confused about what catergory there problem should be filed under  they file under the wrong optionit not only leads to delays in the player getting a response from the gm but also has to frustrate the gms as wellplease expand the support ticket window and give it the ability to createinsert a linksometimes a screen shot speaks a thousand words if the player just happened to be frapsing at time a short replay of what happened as seen by the player could be handythanks
i cant help thinking part of the disconnect is the constant referral to 10000 foot view user statistics how often do devs have to start new characters to experience everything over again sure most of a devs energy is devoted to dev work rather than playing for the countless hours like the player base but shouldnt there be more of an emphasis on repeated firsthand npe experience rather than trying to balance by broad statistics that arent really indicative of a specific player story
they do also do user testing generally not with ccp devs as a dev is the worst person to test their own code as they know how it workstesting with gamers who havent played eve before
theres no shortage of frustration for me especially having done things several times so i hope thats not a no i dont know how to argue against theres a stat for that when a player story is the most important thing
would love to see those numbers how many wspace residents we currently have 
dear ccp dear csmyou spoke about social clubs or societies page 17simplier i would suggest to speak about organizationswe have players or non players corporations or alliancesthere are non players organizations soe for example but no players organizationsthey would allow to gather players who have a same objective without breaking their freedom to be in a corporation or to be soloand we would use like this a concept that already exists in eve but not available for playerswhy shouldnt we be able to build a soe type organization in game good summit and best regards
that is what the societies are player made groupings and tools to facilitate themmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
can you explain the difference you see between what youre suggesting and the social clubs that have been talked aboutthe idea has always been that theyre for organisation of players across corporation lines like rvb ganked spectre fleet and so on
dear mike dear stevei agree that what you proposed as social clubs or societies correspond to what i call organizationsi was just suggesting not to use another name for something that already exists in game but for np onlyeve is enough complicated so that we shouldnt use another wordmoreover today the corporations alliances  organizations discussions forum is forbidden for non alliancecorporation members if we give the name organizations to what you call societies or social clubs i see no reason not to open it now we should call a spade a spadebest regards and thanks for your work
o hooray for raw text on phones
i think he just wants to say that organisations is a better term than societies or social clubs
the word society might make some folks think of high society a place where tea and cakes are served at noon and everyone has to wear nice clothes words like club group organization dont carry that possible connotation
but the name does offer up the potential for secret societies no cake there cake is a lie

nice any new pve content is welcome
this is awesome to see the minutes come out so fast this shows me that ccp thinks the csm is important i hope this trend continuesi am really liking the new ccp
there is an elegant alternative for fleet warp that i think most people will like but sikrit for now because reasons
the csm did a wonderful job and credit to ccp too for the last minutesi do love the near instant minutes though whilst they are not as complete i look forward each day with great interestah choices do i want instant gratification or detailed reportingboth is too much to hope for maybe a more detailed version could be a forum thread dripped in over the next few monthsnope that is asking for our csm to do just too much they are already doing trojan workbut maybe when nda is removed from sections they could be reported in fullthanks all
this sentence made me actually laugh out loudalso why the fear of changing ishtars what makes sentry ishtars so different that they have to be treated so carefully other things seem to be nerfedbuffed without this level of trepidation
reviewing the forums in general wouldnt be a bad idea granted the resources may not be available for a broader forum overhaul but having 38 subforums purely for eve not counting dustvalkforeign language seems a bit excessive they might need to be consolidatedmerged rather than expanded further its not new player friendly and its marginalising certain subforums and topics because casual users cant be arsed rummaging through so many different areasif you are monitoring specific threads in fi an option might be to allow you to create your own folder headers within favourites no idea how the techy side works but quick fixes are probably more viable than large scale implementations
yeah she used to hate nullsec now she hates pvp of any kind i have seen her recently speak out against several things and the only thing they had in common is that they all enable pvp of some kindi see no merit whatsoever in their candidacy so heres my endorsement if you dont hate pvp of every kind dont vote for the op and i think a good player can never grow out of a bad attitude and i still see that in spadesbut so much less fun nevermind that this is not an fi suggestion no matter how much it looks like one this is the csm campaign constructive criticism is quite simply not called for here especially towards someone who rabidly refuses to answer any criticism with anything other than summary dismissals
correction not required but it is recommendedbut im tired of dealing with ignorant folks and you have no excuse as weve been down this road enough times before you and i so ill suffice to say that your accusations of jenshae are in fact factually inaccurate as is demonstrated by her more recent posts as well as her edits to the original csm 10 candidacy platform which you would know if you had read any of it
but they can warp while cloaked main reason i think covert cyno hotdrops should be limited in size is because they so easily evade intel that you never know if theyre coming except when the system is completely free of nonblues it seems unreasonable to me that one red in local could potentially turn into 250 reds in an instant and not at a gate or other beacon visible on the overview and theres no way for you to calculate the probability with available inteli would have limited the size to 10 ships per covert cyno which is plenty enough for a good gank and to hold ground while waiting out a brief timer of say 1 minute until they can light a regular cyno or more covert cynos also easy way around the limitation is to bring multiple covert ops ships through the gates in the first place depending on how that pans out might have to limit to 5 per covert cyno after all but im optimistic about ita brief summary of views expressed in this thread for comparisonjenshae chiroptera the ease of forcing pvp upon an unwilling participant should be balanced with the unwilling participants ability to prevent pvp both parties should have to work toward their goal and both should be given the tools to do somost responders we dont want you on csm because you are antipvp and you want themepark gameplay but this is a pvp game and themepark gameplay should be marginalized to a strong degreemost supporters themepark gameplay is currently overmarginalized and while pvp is acceptable we want enough safety to make pve activities outside of highsec even viable at allreaver glitterstim jenshaes proposals have undergone many edits and reiterations since the original and i recommend you all to take a look at what has changed while i am only partially in support of jenshaes candidacy platform that support is growing quickly and i am eager to see what she comes up with next i suspect jenshae will make an excellent csm candidate in a later election
activity draws attention and helps spread the campaign thread and message the afk cloaker  is perfectly safe has the potential to drop at any moment can not be evicted or hunted even in your home systemi am looking for ways that they need to play actively to get the benefits of what they do they shouldnt get a free lunch in our homeother posts i will read fully and respond after some sleep
i did i also reported her posting here in the first place since she was doing this as a deliberate farce to advocate for the dissolution of the csmand since you went ahead and reposted a tldr it turns out i was rightmy rebuttalgo back to wow pvp is a fundamental part of eve non consensual pvp included there exist already more than enough means for prevention of pvp in all areas of space well that is if you use your whole assthe ops candidacy exists solely to campaign for the right of people to play the game deliberately incorrectly and still be safe from harmif you want a themepark go play one stop trying to shove that distasteful thing into my sandbox game it is most unwelcome
well said an excellent example of some of the hypocrisy we see in common viewpoints about themepark gameplay if it is wrong for pveers to avoid pvp with no ability to be pursued then it is wrong for pvpers to avoid pvp with no ability to be pursued
its an excellent example of an obvious strawman anywaya pve player can just as easily cloak in a safe nothing prevents them from doing this it is not some exclusive activity nor do you make money while doing so in fact you cant do a whole lot of anythingwhat pve players want on the other hand is to be safe while performing lucrative activities that is 100 unacceptable
this caught my eye before i closed the threadreaver waste no more time energy or your finely crafted words on kaarous i have his posts hidden told him openly that he is just a waste of my time and asked him to stop following me around the forums like a sulky child because i got his coup de grUFFFDcereversedby his own admission he is here for forum pvp he does nothing to forward ideas develop them or try and take eve as a whole forward
here i will heed your wishes but my normal response is to adamantly continue to treat all criticisms with a serious honest and direct tone and give them reasonable attention as if they were meaningful posts whether or not i suspect them to be
which is why you of the two have my respect the person youre adhering to on the other hand displays astonishing intellectual dishonesty even dinsdale was better than this
and the defender can do the same fit his own cyno lay his trapthe type of gameplay you advocate gives less power to small groups furthers a carebear mentality and cements the strength of powerblocs even more i dont speak as a goon or an n3 member but as someone that flies in groups of 25 often dealing with enemies that are better equipped and numerically superiormy mind is eased knowing for certain such a mentality will never have a relevant voice in affecting eves gameplay
after reading the first page i had the impression that the op was a troll on steroids and stopped reading the rest so any good points you might have made after page 1 are wasted on me if you want people to listen to you you might want to consider making a more serious op
im not convinced that is the case an aggressor is not limited to ten covert aggressors total but rather is limited to ten covert aggressors per covert cyno per minute the major thing i see coming out of this is a small window to react to a covert hotdrop anyone who wants to bypass it can merely use a noncovert hotdropthis will make it easier to fly capital ships in small groups which may or may not be used more by large alliances probably will this in turn will lead to capital deaths which will make it easier for small groups to roam free im speculating here im uncertain of the effects and i really do support anything that gives large blocs like test less power we have plenty to share
nether could a station docker everywhere but your home system and if i really dont want u to remove me from your home system you never will remove the cyno from everything smaller than a cruiser
docking is not like cloaking because a cloaked pilot in a covert ops ship can roam about and watch whats going on gather intel relay intel set up for an ambush and make plans a docked player can only do what doesnt include gathering intel or moving into a strategic position
i can from dock see whos in systems cross check their kill boards to see what ships they most offten use from there i can tell when these players gather they most offten do this flying this so now i know a fleet is being form ok why would the form a fleet well i know this timer here and here is about to pop now i know if they are going for this timer they will have to travel here to get to the timer ambush set intel gathered
if you consider that intel to be on par with intel gathered from and strategic placement of ships in covert cloak then youre just bad at using intel and strategic placement options
not as good yesbut when the cloak gets nerfed it will be the next thing you will be crying about
are you sure about that whats the last nerf i ever cried aboutedit startling realization on my part i dont think i have ever disliked any nerfs thus far in eve
you was being used in the communal sense suh as you all sry i wasnt cleari dont personaly follow your every post
i dont think most of jenshaes supporters will complain about covert cloak nerfs
rephrase when cloaking gets nerfed  dock campers will be the next thing you will cry about
im interested to learn how dock campers are really all that scary
i feel the same way about cloakers
heres what youre having problems understanding though both the attacker and the defender can use cloaked ships if there is a tool in the game and i use it better than you thats not the tools fault its yours
the way that the op responds to comments whether he agrees with them or disagrees shows me that he would be terrible member of the csm summary dismissal of people without views other than your own is the exact opposite of what a good csm candidate needs to demonstrate seeing how the op seems to think the csm should be dissolved anyways i think that anyone who is considering voting for him should seriously reconsider there are other people who hold similar views who would actually be useful contributors to the game and its developmenti urge everyone to not vote for the op
wrong a planned attack can heavily involve covert ops ships but it is not nearly as possible to respond to a covert ops attack with covert ops ships because the defenders did not have enough warning time to suspect a covert ops attackmy problem with the current cloaking mechanic is not that it hurts some people more than others it doesnt but that it stagnates pvp in general and leads to fewer kills due to increased danger due to decreased intel
your campaign post is really short and limited being someone who did csm interviews for csm9 ive been able to get a better perspective on the process and the internal workings in the csm and i just have to disagree with a lot of what you saysecondly i know your name from somewhere but i just cant remember from whatit would be very nice to write up a bit of background information about yourself what you do in eve online are you active in the meta game what is your current ingame activity just basic informationi am not voting for someone who is a blank person i would like to know a bit more about you
i wonder how many players have no idea what the csm stands for and who never voted before any good suggestions how to get in touch with them and make them care  would be nice if we could use the in game billboards for this
when i first heard that bam was running  thanks to his presence on twitter  i was very surprised then i pretty much forgot about it and got on with my vacationhowever now i have been back a few days i have had plenty of time to read and review his platform i can firmly say that i endorse bam as a social player and one of the front guys of several ingame communities it would be wrong not toohaving met bam and heard his love for the community and seen all that he does on your behalf i find myself sold even more with a true community representative such as bam on the csm the future of eve will be bright indeed
my only complaint was that evemeetcom wasnt up in time for our mn meet up to usewhen it comes to community i dont think anyone can argue that bam isnt in one of the top representative positions for the eve community and to the eve community1 sirhost of high drag podcast
first as has been stated thats a year old but i can happily answer the questions yes its to mean we still have to rely on other areas of space having said that there is now ice in the shattered wormholes you cant mine the ice in the small ones mindim all for any extra content in w space not just harder to run c6 sites without the cap escalation some t3 and guardains or rr tengus with cap escalation 2 carriers 2 dreads and some webbersid be happy with more effects anything that adds interest is good not really sure what tbh id love more people in w space so yeah at the moment i feel its low and hope that it will increaseyou can get market data now from crest which is really up to date i dont have any concern with itthe next bit is a interesting idea if you want to expand on it feel free to mail anything to mepos gunning could use a total overhaul to make it much more interesting its horrid to do at the moment pos guns could also probably use a look at as well since most ships have been buffed but pos stuff hasnt
what do you think of the idea of buffing pos gun damage while making them automatically spread fire out to different targetsgiving the defensive advantage to a medium fleet even before logiand allowing crewed pos guns to be focused on individual targets allowing easy blapping of softer subcaps or significant assistance to blap even the tough ones when coordinating with a defense fleet
oopsforget to post a link to corbexxs cap stable interviewill just leave this here
1 i agree with prelocking the wasd 2 i am trying to see who to talk to about making a semi official library of overviews with commentary funny thing most players protect their overviews like it was the recipe for coke cola i personally use a modified sarashawa3 this i cannot comment upon which should tell you somethingmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i have captains quarters turned off as i sacrifice the game looking pretty for the game running as smoothly as possible i also operate on the absolute minimum graphics settings despite having a middle of the range computer so id never notice them there and am not qualified to answer if that would be a useful place billboards i would endorse a channel advertisement system either one where channels optin or optout as long as it was not mandatory for all channels to be there but i do so with one important caveatit is important to recognise that experienced players can both train and mistrain rookies it is necessary to convey to new players that they can matter in pvp before they have ten million sp and im concerned that rookies might gravitate toward mining or missioning channels where they would receive actively bad advice i did after all begin eve believing that i needed to both field a lot of isk and have a lot of sp to pvp at all and this is the prevailing wisdom amongst many carebears
thats some really bold statements to make on annecdotal evidence all the people i have spoken to seem to say the opposite that c1 to c4 are doing really well i wonder whos right  you can find alot of the info in the wormhole winter summit minutesby not having any major changes you mean things like a huge increase in pay outs for c1 to c4 the fact relic and data sites from k space have been addedyou do also realise that finding specific c6 whs are also by far the easiest wormholes to find id hardly call them insulatedfirst its not awoxing you mean corp on corp and if people want immunity they can do it right now just by being in a npc corp if this was as much of a issue as you say people would have been leaving w space ages ago to run incursions in npc corps so your arguement really falls down here
cap stable interview
this is arguable its only interesting to you because of conflict some players are quite happy without it there are all types in this game and everyone should get a say not just your guys there are numerous reasons not to play on the test server  no social interaction potential resets more downtime people pay to play this sandbox game in whatever way they see fit and thats what they do ccp support that you supporting only conflict driven content makes you no better than someone supporting only nonconflict combat if you cant understand that there should be a balance between the two theres no talking to you
i and many others agree with those changes you dont like it because it takes away easy awoxing but im more of the opinion that if newbies get recruited more and more into the game when you and your ilk inevitably try to gank them theyll stick with the game rather than leaving you can whine all you want about how it should be done in other ways but those other ways require players to change their ways to actually teach newbies instead of just ganking and trolling them well thats not going to happen ccp cant patch players behaviours so they patch what they can to steer it perhaps you should have thought of the consequences of targeting people who are primarily newer while you think you are a content creator youre not really you create content only for yourself denying content for your targets you do this under the impression that ccp value what you do more well wake up ccp are running a business and they will act in whatever way they see fit to ensure the health of that buesiness if that means changing direction a bit to accommodate more players thats where they will goi doubt highsec will ever be completely safe but highsec is a place where pvp is done in a different way a lot of pvp doesnt take place with turretsnull bears generally have no issues with the worst offenders in their alliances being taught by someone else the only thing they have issue with is when its alluded to that its elite combat the primary issue i have with wardeccers is the sheer number of wardecs able to be performed it was all designed so you have a grudge with someone theres a way to be able to fight with them what its used for instead is to farm kills with smaller independent corps being the ones that suffer the most from iteven if they do get on theyll quickly realise that their opinions wont suddenly hold more power when ccp want to do something to aid player retention no kicking or screaming about the spirit of eve will make them jeopardise their company they certainly arent going to get listened to if their primary decision is based on extra conflict  automatically good less conflict  automatically bad
if i buy call of duty and then go on their forums and complain that other people are allowed to shoot me i would probably be banned for trolling and rightfully soeve online is no less a pvp game whether you partake of that or not you should still recognize and accept it if your say consists of what other people like about the game should be deleted then no you really shouldntsee the call of duty example above you dont get to have a say when it comprises complete opposition to the spirit of the game if you hate it that much why are you playing it in the first placeread the faq it says in no uncertain terms eve online is a pvp game if you cant understand that then you cant be redeemed as a player
i pref the market to be floaded and to pay ccp 20 and they would give me 15 billion isk so i can get some cheap stuff to lose since i have no time to grind then to buy a plex and sell it on the market to greedy isk people who play 247 and only think of themselfs everything expensive to fly even a firgate makes playing eve for those who cant play 247 unplayable its not verry fun to pay sub and need to buy plex to sell for 800million wich makes playing eve and have some fun cost 40 to lose expensive t1 frigs cruisers and modules to feed isk whores pockets again everything cheap in eve would make losing ships in low sec fights more fun
i dont get where these people claiming that ccp are changing awoxing to protect newbiesi do not advocate this but if you wanted to make a change to pvp to protect newbies you would prevent lowsec gatecamping that is where newbies lose ships to mistakes all the time particularly in lowsec systems that sell skillbooks removing awoxing is nothing but a change to protect career highsec players and to reward recklessness competently led corporations were seldom infiltrated and if a disloyal member got in they seldom did damage with blue on blue highsec attacks  the disloyal member might land tackle but other loyal members would arrive on grid before anyone was killed
eve online is a sandbox virtual world the appeal is that you can do what you want sure all actions affect other players and in that sense its pvp but that doesnt mean that every change must generate conflictits a balance you want to have more conflict which takes away their ability to play while being relatively safe they want to play in safety while you are unable to shoot them ccp finds a balance between the two whats funny is that your quote of what other people like about the game should be deleted is exactly the same from the other side there are plenty of people that want more conflict in high sec by removing opportunities to play pve safely or want changes like 05s to be concordfree or level 4 missions to only appear in lowsecreferring to the call of duty strawman again doesnt make it any more relevant call of dutys primary gameplay is based around guns and shooting removing that would be like removing spaceships from eve which is what eve is built around shooting people is just a part of the game just like pve is to make you analogy more correct changes to one or the other are like changes to team based mechanics like ctf or deathmatch mechanics both of which are valid styles of play in codand yes i get to have a say i also play this game and have don for a long time what you think is not automatically correct until the day that ccp decides to delete pve from the game it will remain a completely valid playstyle and should also receive as much attention as any other part if improving that gameplay upset yours and ccp still decide to go ahead then tough luck buddy thats what happens when you play a game with more than one playstyle being catered to if you dont like it you have as much right to quit as anyone elsepvp as in what you do affects other players not as in the game is only about shooting other people eve is a lot more complex that that hence my claim that ideas should be judged on their individual merits and not automatically accepted and rejected based on how much conflict they create and until you run ccp you have no say in whether or not im redeemed as a player
its not to protect newbies in that way its not to stop newbies being shot its to encourage people to recruit newbies by removing one of the major risks with recruiting newbies if a newbie cant be a corp attacker i use this term as awoxing covers other activities still allowed it means theres no problem in giving a newbie a chance in a corp career highsec players already have protection they can be in npc corps or in corps of just their alts which protect them as much as this change does a lot of people are simply blowing this change way out of proportion so they can make their objections sound more grand
after listening to the interview on capstable i have a few questions1 you stated there that you would like to see industryhighsec corps fight back against organisations such as your own  how would you say the effects of highsec warfare neutral scouts logistics and the like influences this ability i have been in mercenary high sec corps before and what we were hearing from our targets was mostly we cant fight you anyway as youll have a horde of neutral chars backing you up  any ideas on that problem2 you are very actively talking about the end of awoxing and the likesdo you have any ideas of how big the contribution of highsec incorp kills has been any numbers on that because the way you talk about this change one gets the impression this is a huge topicfollow up on this  how is your oppinion on the thesis that more intracorp conflicts will make more people stay in npc or singleplayer cops3 during your interview i kind of felt that you were promoting a point of play the game the way i enjoy to play it in highsec or dont play it  any comments on thatas someone who runs highsec activities to participate in the markets and industry but lives in wspace im curious to why i should be considered a risk averse carebear while on my highsec characters4 regarding freighter ganking  is it ok from your point of view that you currently can not even fill a freighter with max cargo fitting with tritanium without beeing a somewhat worthy gank target 700m cargo with trit about twice that much on pyerite what is in your oppinion the job of ships like freighters if you cant even move cheap basic materials with them without bringing a webber along5 regarding wspace i can only agree with corbexx  please get some data before you make bold assumptions and statements on annecdotal evidence
eves biggest strength is the depth of player interaction that is undeniable changes dont have to generate conflict but changes that take away from conflict by definition take away player interactionthat is not a good thingexcept that i am not advocating that missions be deleted i dont want their playstyle to go away entirelythey do want the elimination of mine that has been made clear many many times over the years theres a good indicator of that going on right now in fact with awoxing being deleteddont try to pretend like there is any moral equivalency between the two sides because there is not and if i go there and hatefully demand that my playstyle involves walking around in that game being immune to bullets people will laugh at methats exactly what we have here when you have someone demanding something entirely contrary to the reality of the gamewhy that is even being entertained i cannot imagineand if you havent figured it out yet i am not talking about pve which although i truly despise it has a place in this game i am talking about the kind of people who insist that they should be immune to the actions of other people the people who want to pretend like an mmo is a single player gamethe last thing this game needs is more safety it has too much already thats why everything is so inflated compared to a few years ago
that entirely depends on the change and thats my point a blanket statement of that is obviously bad because it reduces conflict isnt a good way to look at ideas a csm member should be able to look at the individual merits of an idea and not rules them out based on such a simplistic viewand most dont want ganking to go away entirely either sure some people do but some people also want concord completely gone too if youre only going to take the most extreme opinions you have to do the same for both sides if you want to look at it realistically some people want more safety some people want less thats all neither is categorically right or wrong and balance needs to be foundand awoxing isnt being deleted corp aggression  the easiest form or an awox  is being removed to give highsec corps more freedom to recruit newbies its not the end of the world so stop trying to play it up like it is sure its negative to your playstyle but then change always are negative to someone when they released the refining changes a whole category of pve players was nerfed and they got over it so just htfu and get on with itexcept thats not a valid playstyle in cod while it is in eve you can avoid being killed hell my traders have a 0 chance of being killed since they never leave stations and they make orders of magnitude more isk than other forms of pvethats not what we have here what we have here is someone of the opinion that any change that reduces conflict is automatically bad youre the one then dragging that into being against an argument that isnt being put forward its a common thing for you these days anytime anyone says anything that suggests a that pve players deserve some effort from ccp is instantly met with you arguing against the idea that pvp should be removed that argument is in your headmy statement was incredibly simple any idea regardless of whether it increase or decreased conflict should be looked at for its own merits any csm candidate who will automatically disregard ideas because they reduce conflict without giving them a second look is not a good candidate
thats the whole point there is no merit to ideas that reduce player interaction none they should be dismissed out of hand
you sir are incorrect there is more to eve than the specific way you play it and to improve some styles of play requires some changes which reduce interaction in one way or another you obviously cant look objectively at these things so good day to you
well  kaarous in what category would the jump fatigue changes fallmore interaction because of less risk involved to get hotdropped thereby promoting more smallmedscale fightsless interaction because of slower movement there reducing the number of players at battlesyou cant put every change into a category like increases or decreases interaction  it doesnt work that way
if you read what i mentioned above it is possible for a change to be a net neutral i firmly believe that the jump range changes were such but promoted a greater increase in small scale conflicts particularly subcapital fights than it did to discourage capital fightsso id say it ended up as a net positive for wider spread conflict but that was just one of those well have to wait and see kinds of things a change that on its outset clearly detracts from potential player interaction is a different matter entirely
then they shouldnt be improved in that way there are plenty of ways to improve this games pve without crippling player interactionpersonally i think they were on the right track with burner rats and that more missions should involve elite enemies instead of blowing away wave after wave of zerging ratsyoure trying to claim that the only way pve can be improved is at my expense and that just exposes it for what it really isits not about improving your gameplay and it never was its about hurting mine and thats why people like sabriz need to be elected because ccp needs to hear my voice and the voice of people who care about pvp and the sandbox all over eve
again you seem to have no concept of a minor change a change to improve pve which is detrimental to interaction is not necessarily going to cripple player interaction you have a very extreme view of changes against player interaction but not so the other wayno im claiming that some ways will affect your gameplay all changes will affect someone negatively no matter what that change is you have no problem with other peoples gameplay getting affected by positive changes to yours but when the shoe is on the other foot you scream blue murderits got absolutely nothing to do with hurting your gameplay everyones opinions need to be listened to not just your select group of players your happy to go on about how the carebears shouldnt have a say yet you act the exact same way from the opposite side of the fence and your opinion is supposed t be listened to insteadyou are not better or more important than any other player and other peoples opinions are valid too a csm representative should represent the needs of the community as a whole not just one subset of players sabriz complained that toras campaign is geared around benefiting himself and his friends and thats exactly the same if sabriz agrees to automatically reject any idea which decreases conflict without consideration and lets face it if a csm member becomes known for rejecting ideas without consideration they are less likely to be the ones listened to when ccp makes a decision sabriz would serve his players better by taking on board the ideas put forward and giving solid reasons why they should not be implemented rather than rejecting them out of hand but then again players from your camp never have been very good at reasoning just exploding into zomg you want total safety im paying it forward waah waah why u nerf me ccp every time a minor change is suggested
you seem to have a very limited view of player interaction i would think that corporations not being as at risk from a newbie recruit might well increase player interaction by reducing the level of trust required for players to cooperate
deletion of an entire playstyle is not a minor change so knock off the lies and obfuscation if ccp proposed tomorrow that missions be deleted i would be right up there with the mission runners demanding it be overturned because whether i like something or not and i despise eves pve content with all my heart does not merit its deletionyour side on the other hand is not capable of being impartial or fair you just want pvp deleted as often and as thoroughly as possible
why do you keep avoiding him shouldnt a csm listen to everyone and not just the players who agree with you dont you think its arrogant to tell people not to post any more on the public eveo forum 
forum rules prevent me from answering this question fullyin short seraph is neither interested in a productive discussion about the csm nor in my platform as a whole we have a history together that dates back over two years to when we were in the same corp together him as the ceo and myself as the director we did not part amicably  that much im sure is obvious i engaged with him during my csm9 campaign but the aftermath of that nonsense proved to me that simply ignoring him is the best course of actionim all for discussions about the game debating conflicting ideas and defending both my position and opinions but im not going to humor someone who harbors nothing but malicious intent towards me
would you say thats something common with you i cant say that sugar kyle or fuzzy steve have people that have such feelings towards them it wouldnt be a good quality in a csm to cause such feelings from the player body at the end of the day we all know this is a game but if youre the type of person that elicits that response from people it would be detrimentalto all of us to have you presenting our problems to ccp
i apologize in advance for using argument ad absurdum but by this logic any cfc candidate  even the mittani himself  would have been a detriment to the csm since they have enemies in a game of conflict its impossible to constantly fight and compete with others without making enemies let alone having everyone still like youas for people like fuzzy mike et al they do not engage in adversarial play styles so the comparison is mootthere are many candidates who can present your problems to ccp and in your specific case sugar is probably the best one for the job that being said the people who i compete against or who am hostile with would never find themselves without a voice on the csm due to my inclusion on the council i would never purposefully oppose change or try to silence those who i dislike simply because i dislike them or because in game they are my enemy this is no different than cfc candidates advocating for the health of the game as a whole rather than the health of their specific coalition
i have removed a rule breaking postalso as i have stated earlier please refrain from stating the same counter arguments or personal opinions over and over againthis is a csm campaign thread please keep it civilthe rules2 be respectful toward others at all times the purpose of the eve online forums is to provide a platform for exchange of ideas and a venue for the discussion of eve online occasionally there will be conflicts that arise when people voice opinions forum users are expected to be courteous when disagreeing with others 4 personal attacks are prohibited commonly known as flaming personal attacks are posts that are designed to personally berate or insult another forum user posts of this nature are not beneficial to the community spirit that ccp promote and as such they will not be tolerated13 spamming is prohibited spam is defined as the repetitive posting of the same topic or nonsensical post that has no substance and is often designed to annoy other forum users this can include the words UFFFDfirstUFFFD UFFFDgo back to insert other game nameUFFFD and other such posts that contribute no value to forum discussion spamming also includes the posting of ascii art within a forum post isd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls

i would like your honest opinion on fw missions their affect and influence in being able to singlehandedly swing and sustain one factions hold over warzone dominance ie see amarrminnie wz past 6 years and the impact nonpvp pilots have in this regardi would like you to look past yourself and your own interests in isk generation when i propose the possible mission acceleration gate restriction to tech 2 and tech 3 hulls from entering them and your thoughts on it thank you muad may you be worth your waterpolish comes from the cities wisdom from the desert
sadly too many people blame incarna rather than ccps management

exactly even outside of roleplay i will bring up the swg situation every time until it sticksswg had cantinas usually big buildings that made it a pain in the butt to get around town because youd have to go around them they served no practical purpose in 90 of circumstances however they were regularly filled with a couple hundred people whybecause even if it serves no gameplay purpose people like to socialize sitting down next to someone in a bar is a classic awkward way to force interactiondiscussion people like face2face time putting an avatar they can actually see to the voice they hear or the text they see wis to start with doesnt have to have some amazing oh my god feature right off the bat it can and should start simply as a way for players to physically associate mingle etc
it isnt just a game about blowing up spaceships its a game about space yes with ships yes conflict yes but only about 10 of the game is actual fighting the other 90 of that game is all the different functions and events that enable that pvp the people meeting and forming friendships rivalries the spys saboteurs and usurpers collapsing empires or emptying wallets the little groups uniting against common enemiesif eve is about anything is social interaction and politics because these are the reasons we have pvp if we didnt have these the only pvp that would be in the game is the occasional lowsec gank and not much else and if you think thats all that matters then i assume youd be fine if they just removed the entire game and replaced it with matchmakingincarna has a purpose to enable more personal social interaction as well as a little bit of scenery for people to hang out and leave running on their computer while they do other stuff social interaction is just as valid a reason to play eve as mindless pvp so theres nothing wrong with catering to that crowdalso lol at second life which was neither the first most recent or most significant game to have avatars most games do nowadays weird huh
theres something fundamentally wrong with analyzing the current player base and i think basically were not a valid or ideal data group weve proved that were accepting of bad gameplay my opinion is that eve seems to filter most players it encounters down to those of us who continue to play for reasons other than fun for me i was introduced to eve just prior to joining the army and entering flight school so it was my plan to continue training but not experience gameplay for what ended up being 3 years other players will stay for irl friendships and other reasons that arent related to the conventional goal of fun so studying us for some insight into what might make eve wildly popular is very offcourseif you continue catering to players like me its pretty much a waste of effort i think all those players who leave are far more valuable for studying their behavior with the goal of making eve wildly popularanother reason i am not a good candidate for study is because i am a tinkerer and i like projects and taking apart broken electronics to see how they work and then put them back together im not here because im having fun im here because i am obsessed with problems and i want to figure out what is wrong with this broken thing  eve there are some basic conventional expectations that eve does not meet and i think theyre crucial to the type of recreational experience people expect from a video game one of them is a gradual rampup in training times and the other one is range of performance in shipsi think people are accepting of the idea that an item in a video game has a range of performance and can be improved overtime two of the worst disconnects between game structure and player expectations of improvement over time are role bonuses and level v requirements of base hull skills of t2 ships role bonuses are a poof magic effect that is granted as soon as the item is obtained this presents a few problems starting with betraying the players expectation of gradual improvement with skills  a concept we can all accept  poof magic also a big part of the reason for the outcry when i suggest making t2 ships more accessible to players at lower skill levels when such a big portion of a ships capability exists automagically perhaps the naysayers are correct for disagreeing with my proposals of rearranging skill requirements linear progression should appease the naysayers i would imagine t2 ships are not linear enough in their improvement in their current formt2 ships also receive a set of bonuses based on the base hull skill which is required at level v at the same time in effect this results in an additional poof magic set of bonuses that are applied at fullstrength upon obtaining the item again this is a betrayal of a players expectation that there will be gradual improvement of an item over time it also contributes to the apprehensiveness of players who attempt to imagine a linear proliferation of t2 shipsbase hull skill requirements at level v and role bonuses are huge failures in providing linear gameplaythere is a longheld convention in eve that specialization means that skills should be required upfront i agree that specialization refers to the range of performance in an item and that it should involve several levels of focused skill training however the requirement of level v skills is not justified in my opinioncompared to allowing players to obtain t2 ships and improve them gradually i struggle to find reasons why they should have their current arrangement base ship skills at level v presents a time wall and a subscription barrier that makes sense from a profit standpoint but it holds gameplay hostage for financial gain the other possibility that disturbs me is that someone holds the basic sentiment that specialization should be uncomfortable and painful because eve is hardcore the bad news is this form of hardcore is not fun and it drives people away who expect a logical satisfying gaming experienceits impossible to know for sure because the reasons for the current convention of specialization are basically because specializationideally i think t2 ship progression should allow all level v skills to be grouped at the end of the skill queue with base hull bonuses available to fly at level i and role bonuses being unlocked in a linear manner such as on a permastery level basis this way the endgoal of a fullyskilled perfect specialized ship is possible with a wider range of performance and linear progression for players
awsome to see you guys like the quick minutes makr sure u give everyone at ccp involved a big cheer and some of us that type proper english edit them until really late to ensure u all get them quick and rightfrom mu point of view too see a ccp this engaged moving forward with putting players first and encorporating players and players actions into areas that are traditionally theirs is amazing too see ccp take control of their and our game in a year and turn the release cadence into something you all love is even more wooopie doopie we have been welcomed talked too presented listened feedbackerdedefd and explained so many things some guy tweeted ccp has to many white collars i can tell you i havent seen one well tbh on sions shirt one day bit tired but thnx all involved wow
this is the idea more information will come in the form of dev blogs once were in a position to announce features and work thats moved beyond the design phase and is in productionstuff will come in time we just cant talk about some of it yet ccp falcon  eve universe community manager  ccpfalcon
its all about fun baby
many of us have bent eve to our will through time and experience and wits but this type of painful unsatisfying experience is not what popular games are made of if you tell me the goal is to maintain a cult following i will give up my hopes of eve becoming something more
it isnt the goal for me mmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
o
curious dose ccp sees any issues with people fly smart bombing machariels to kill npc rats in anoms as something of a issue why wasnt there any discussion about the progress of the dogma code rewrite  its larger implications for completion of the ship tiercide project there has been a number of times it has been given as the reason as to why capitals supers  titans cant be rebalanced yet not to mention its been used as justification as to delays in ccps ability to do work on poss and other thingswould of thought this would of been a high priority when will we be able to change rigs on ships without them having to be destroyed  that would be a significant change that would open up allot of options for use of ships across the board instead of looking to nerf tengus why not fix the other t3s so they are on par with the tengu  answer is it isnt the ship its self thats the issue its the medium sized weapons platforms their range and fall offs the weapons on the others cant do what you can do with a tengu in fleets so fix that instead of just nerfing a single t3 because people take advantage of what it can be done with it if ccp revisited cynos and made the skill requirements lower for covert cynos and allowed it to be fitted to more ships you would see an increase in the use of ships that can use them to jump but at the sametime you have to address the fatigue issue around using covert cyno jumps as well jumping to covert cynos should not incur as much fatigue as jumping to a normal cyno battleships  these ships have been almost outclassed by cruisers to a point whereby they arent used anywhere near what they were go back 4yrs ago are there any plans on revisiting them so they dont get get consigned to the waste bin  localizationid really like to know if ccp would look at making buying plex available in more currencies other than usd or gbpcurrency conversion rates hurt allot of people and are a barrier for many people that pay for their game time with rl money rather than in game isk for example personally i resent paying up to 1000 more than the usd1995  transaction fees on top to buy a single plex besides buying plex  buying other eve merchandise is also an issue for people with currency conversion rates which often makes it too expensive and out of reach for peoples affordability sovereignty  nullsec show us the statistics pleasealso show us stats showing a comparison of wormhole travel usage before and after the changesalso will ccp look at introducing something more than the risk vs reward system that would encourage more players to move from high sec in to low  nul sec something else that hasnt been mentioned is the availability or drop rate of certain faction navy types ammo  dead space items has stopped and disappeared from the markets generic faction ammo can be purchased via loyalty points but things like dg ts db ammo types cant be again there is a range of dead space items that in the last 12 months have become unavailable are they being removed from the game or has something brokenlastly and it hasnt been covered anywhere so far in the summit would ccp look at rotating downtime so that a single time zone is not solely affected 
generally speaking i suspect the time to bring up a stack of fresh questions is not after the 3rd day of 4 or during the csm summit at allbut areen didnt you ask about the impersonation clause after day 1 er yes sorrybut to this one i cant speak for ccp but i suspect it is not a coincidence that downtime is during the icelandic working day with the whole afternoon left to respond to any immediate crises and as such it seems unlikely it would be at a radically different time
the problem here is that the community isnt advise of what the agenda for the summit is in advance so we can only respond as the minutes are released and the topics are shown if we knew the agenda in advance we could send evemails to the csm representatives beforehand and ask them to speak for us on points of our concern  to ask our questions rather than relying on them being guided solely by their own experiences
4th day summit has endedmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i for one was on at least three podcasts and blogged asking for issues to bring forward ccp chose to keep the agenda close to their chest but a simple examination of the last three would have lead you to fairly accurately predict the big onesmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i am in eve cause its a kick ass ride tbh i te a game that has captivated me in a way i never thought possible considering i am crazy enough apperenlty about it that i am typing this ina icelandic hotellobby aftehr a week of back to back meetings to see eve has a future a direction and a plan that guides the big thing of things and is in a healthy state to put it out there is one of the thingsi take home with me others are dedicated and talented people engaged players and the beatu of eve in its play grapics emergent addictive elements and the social community around itcall me a eve junkie
on the issue of battleships one thing that stands out to me is the marauder ability of functioning as a miniature dread with bastion mode it isnt a complete redefinition of battleships but i consider the addition of bastion mode a significant gesture toward making battleships more interestingi think the answer lies in raising the dps ceiling of battleships and battlecruisers by 50 mostly due to their signature radius being disproportionately big compared to their current dps figures as well as every other factor of their classes the basic idea is bringing battleships and battlecruisers closer to bridging the gap between subcapitals and dreadso7 to the csms for your service
good work on the fast relese of the minutesstrange picture of the cat though is that schrUFFFDdingers cat like the nda topic it stands in i am geussing it is both dead and alive untill we open the sandbox eve 
this is ccp kitteh he belongs to ccp falcon and me 3

and the circle is completeenjoy folks    we worked hard whether it shows or notmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
dthanks for the swift posting leeloo i was wondering if you all would be working on this on saturday thanks much for getting it up and hope you get to properly enjoy the weekend 
i want you to know that im mighty mad about this sudden and unexpected namechange to the best ship in eve i hope ccp will fix this great error in no time
good job all thanks for the effort and top marks on the minutes
balancing meeting was the one of most interest too me i wonder if there was more said in detail and more ships discussedsome things i would like too see addressed are t3 ships having t2 resists removed it should be the domain of t2 ships only having inbuilt t2 resists a hull advantage removing rigs is the favoured option for sure on t3s less expense also less hp trimarksextenders good thing i would like a stronger discussion on subs and t3 hulls they are hugely expensive now and any nerfs would need price reductions here for sub switching too happen they need too be cheap too even consider buying stacks of the different subs either for in station changes or for putting in cargo for switching during fleet roams moving too hunt a targetremove sp loss  its a pointless punitive mechanic build in fittinghp etc into the hull so swapping subs is easier too do slots being removed and the mods stripped every time you change a sub is unnecessary time wasting and it would be easier for comparisons being able too look at the ships attributes rather than the 10s of subs there areon combat bcs  i would like the current abcs talos etc moved to a t2 hull as they are specialist ships using oversized guns this would allow some of the current cbcs moved into the attack section thus allowing more mobility on those that need iton capitals removing logi bonuses links from basic carriers would allow supers too have that as their domain instead giving them a use add supercarrier skillbook too further separate them from carriers also remove sentries heavies from carriersremove dronefighter assist
i would suggest the dps ceiling needs to be put on cruisers the dps of things like gilasvnisishtars and a few others are what makes bcs and battleships less useful aswell as bcs excessive sig radius and fitting needs a bit of a raise on bcs aswell as making t1 links more accessible too younger players in these shipsa combination of overbuffing cruisers and overnerfing bcs and some battleships being left neglected plus warp speed changes
ishtars need to achieve at least 50 of all pvp damage to get touched upon
on day 4has either ccp andor csm talked about promoting voting for csm xor did that not make the minutes or is ndaed 
it is no fun being targeted by a huge alliance of many corps combined if you are a small corp of only several members it takes all the fun out of the game if you are primarily industrialists miners and mission runners against those that are pvprs first and foremost i always thought low sec was the place for such as these so they could pummel each other into pieces to their hearts content there is nothing wrong with hi sec being a theme park those that are there are happy with it they do not like being repeatedly ganked and war deced low is the place for that it needs fixing
eve is a competitive sandbox game not a mining simulator or spacethemed version of farmville your industrial operation affects the rest of us so why should you be isolated from the actions of your competitorsif you dont want to compete with the other corporations then just stay in an npc corp and you are immune to wardecs its not ideal and ccp is working on a social system for you but for now make a chat channel for the people you want to mine mission or build stuff with and you are 100 immune from wardecs you thought wrong highsec is not nor ever has been a riskfree place to do industry highsec has some unique mechanisms to control the types of engagements but it has always been intended as a place where players and corporations can compete with each other both directly through ship pvp and indirectly through the multitude of competitive actions that all players engage in everyday there is much wrong with a highsec theme park it would break a great many things and even further draw players away from the other spaces highsec will always be a place of sucide ganks and wardecs  these are things that have been put into highsec on purpose by ccp for good reason sure wardecs have some problems and could be made better but they have always been a part of the design of highsec this is a pvp game you can do only industry or pve and never ship combat but you better make arrangements for your own defense with pvpers you cannot extract the benefits of living in a competitive world while expecting to be immune from the touch of others you are competing with
i love that my detractors are from code and marmite it tells me i am on the right course a few tactics i have seen recently with afk cloakers every system camped two cloakers one sneaks up and tackles the other cynos at range they hit score and mjd away counter drop lands on nothing afk cloaker sits around for ages people decide to fly some cheap stuff to make some isk a loan saber rushes up the systems or logs on warps to the cloaker at range which lands him on the targets and tackles a few ratters working together or a mining fleet then the cyno goes up at range for an mjd escapet3s under most situations cant be killed before the blop gets in as far as i know there is also no way to jam a covert cyno with say a scrambler or neuting the cyno ship
look if youre gonna brag about how big your pens is let me just say that i dont really care no one really caresi think this alpha male crap is bad for your campaign if people make childish comments about wow or what ever else they throw at you you should just let them bethe better man knows when to not respond to such childish comments
ive listened to your interview on cap stable and i was stunned by the amount of trouble you were envolved in to be fair how can you ask people to trust you after all that stuff 
i wasnt involved in any of it when the monument was vandalized i was not even in the countrythe interviewer misidentified me as the person who leaked apis and as i said in that recorded that wasnt me perhaps you should listen to the interview again
okay lets ignore all the bullshit and long past incidences for a whileanswer me this xenuria as most csm members are either very active forum goers who contribute to many discussions or politcally savvy and wellfollowed ingame players why should i vote for you when i rarely hear of you ingame doing much of anything until its mentioned perhaps offhand long after the incident and as far as january is concerned you havent really posted outside of your own csm candicacy threadyou just dont seem very active within the community in any leadershipsignificant role ingame or forums and a csm member should be somebody whos not only an enabler someone who allowsmakes things happen but somebody others want to talk to and frankly i cant really think of alot of people who would consider you in their top 10 of people ithey could go to for help
did you have a question i am not being snide i just see a long statement ended with a  if you have a specific question i will answer it
shortened to reveal the question
basically why do you feel qualified or that youll bring players interests to the board as a member of the csm when you do not or rarely participate in the community you wish to representbasically if you want my vote i want a good reason why i should when i hardly ever see you join in on community discussions or even just the standard shitpost thread your never there as evident of your forum history in the month of january youve not really posted outside this thread at allyour not an active member of this community so why should you represent it
i am an active member of the community the eve online official forums are not the only place players share their ideas i regularly convo and chat publicly with my constituency in eve online
so much this and so much more but you cannot force education i know ive triedmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
resistance is futile  you shall vote bushido its not that you need to force people as i agree that wont work but some just didnt really give it much attention if there is a way to let them know why its important they might give it a couple of minutes more i hope
switch a few words and oh the irony here
my habit of not reading who made the post made the last comment a bit of a puzzle i agree that it does have the seeds of irony but i have supported a few changes that abdicated gameply yes if you asked me i would even make an argument against fleet warp so i did support the move against multicasting for the same reason players are what makes this game great not subbed accounts playersmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
nah i was just remembering a conversation you had with a group of friends and i regarding censorship and nerfs based solely on the idea that wah theyre doing something differently at the time you were 100 in favor of restricting gameplay and player choices because someone minmaxed harder than someone else
mike isnt in my 2 spot hes actually in my 1 spot sabriz is in my 0 spot for being stunningly excellent
an once again im not stating your playstyle should be deleted very few people are once again youd rather argue against that strawman than the actual point which is that stating that any change which reduces conflict should be rejected out of hand is far too simplistic a view for a csm candidate to take yet again you seem to read whats written then automatically assume that between the lines it says delete entire playstyle and you choose to argue about that its pointless even trying to have a rational discussion with someone like you as you have absolutely no intention of comprehending what is said in your mind everyones out to get you i say ideas should be considered on their own merits and somehow you read that as pvp should be removed from the game time and again with you ive seen the same thing someone suggests a tiny change you freak out like theyve just asked ccp to remove guns and yet you expect ccp to take your protests seriously
just listened to your cap stable interview and i found it very thought provoking and interesting that said i dont really agree on much you say  i want high sec abolished apart from a few nursery systems for new players and anything else is just a waste of dev time imo high sec doesnt make sense at least to most players ive talked to yet most eve players chose to live there even with the best and more rewarding content elsewhere why the answer is quite simple isnt it you cant trust anyone in eve but you can trust npcs to protect you in high sec which for me is a rather terrible situation for eve to be inive just taken a year or so break from eve and i made a new character to see whether i wanted to come back or not and managed to watch enough predatory high sec players doing their thing with my new character that i came to the following conclusion the longer that gankersgriefers operate with impunity and complete safety in high sec buzzing around in their pods the more ccp will be pushed to act by those on the receiving end of the gank i personally dont think buffing things for carebears or continuing to allow the gankers to operate as they do now as good for the game in the long term i know a lot of players who have gone full turtle after a high sec wardec including myself and i know lots of people who quit altogether but i dont blame gankers of high sec wardeccers for eves problems i blame high sec mechanicsso because i see high sec as the cancer slowly killing off eve subscribers and i want the vast majority of high sec to be abolished i obviously wont be voting for you as your manifesto stands however i would really appreciate it if you could answer a question  do you think that the likes of yourself marmite and code would adapt and find enjoyable content in eve if high sec was downgraded to low or null sec i know this may seem like a strange question but i honestly think that high secs days are numberedthis character is currently my main and in an npc corp because ive not decided on the area he is going to operate in yet and there will be a lot of lossmails on my way there i expect since im rusty
then you need to stop acting like people are upset about a minor change its dismissive and dishonesti expect ccp to take my statements equally as seriously as those on the opposing side the problem is that theyre only listening to one side of the argument and it damn sure isnt my sidewhich is precisely why people like sabriz must be elected to the csm
except you are at this point you are upset at the idea of giving ideas that reduce conflict a reasonable look before rejecting them so youre in fact upset at nonexistent changes you repeatedly harp on about the removal of your playstyle to people who have not stated thats what they want if you have a problem with other peoples ideas tell them dont tell me when were talking about something differenteven with sabriz on your side if you repeatedly screech about every single tiny change as if its the end of the world you wont be taken seriously and if sabriz repeatedly raises it he also wont be taken seriously as it is his entire campaign seems to be based around forcing other people to generate content for code regardless of their playstyle so even if he gets in i doubt hell be a major voice on the csm
i think you are under a bit of a misapprehension about the reason for the change to intracorp aggression actually is ccp has indicated that it is actually to increase interaction and therefore conflict by getting more new players into highsec corporations where thy will compete with other corps for resources and market share or directly using the wardec mechanics ccp is not implementing this proposal to reduce conflict the problem i have with the changes are twofold first it is unlikely to work as new players that actually want to already have no problem finding a corp so this will not influence the players behaviour but it will protect and stabilize poor corps and downright exploitive corps and allow them to abuse newbies there is no guarantee that this change will get newbies into actually good corps that will increase their chances of staying in the game second in order to try to get highsec corps to accept more new players ccp is essentially bribing them with a flag to turn of a major risk to the established players in the corp this is actually a significant reduction in risk to these players and will reduce conflict in the sandbox ccp is betting that the net increase in player retentioninteraction with highsec corps will offset this loss in content i think they are wrongso no ideas that are designed to specifically reduce content should and are usually are rejected out of hand by ccp csm members also should reject any change to the sandbox that the primary outcome will reduce interaction or content  that is selfevident the problem arises when ccp and the csm hopes that certain changes like increasing the safety of highsec will result in more player interaction or retention and when that doesnt materialize such changes really just diminish conflict in the sandbox and the game is worse off than before we need insistent voices on the csm to point out to ccp when they are in danger of doing this first being vocal about change that removes your previous playstyle or perhaps more accurately in this case strongly nerfs should not be characterized as screeching  that is condescending to the concerns of a fellow player these changes to intracorp aggression mechanics do exactly that to the niche group of players that participated in these corporate infiltration escapades a fundamental part of their gameplay haswill be altered by these changes and they should be hearddj funkybacon a csm member made an impassioned plea for the value of intracorp aggression during the summer csm meeting starting on page 77 of course i cant know for sure but i give him and his defense of intracorp agression much credit for the toning down of the proposal from the complete removal of intracorp aggression to the optional flag we have now so your hypothesis that csm members that support a proconflict view of highsec will be ignored by ccp or the csm seems rather weakin fact ccp seagull has made it clear that her vision of eve is one where players are always in grand conflict with each other  everything will be destroyable she says it was also made clear at last years fanfest that players in social groups stay with the game much longer therefore development resources are not going to be spent on changes to the game that reduce conflict or interaction or at least that will not be the intention unless there is a major change in direction there will be no significant new pve content  that ship has sailed further the importance of highsec will be minimized when the new player built stargates come online as a necessity to justify the current direction she is taking the game representatives that get that eve is about conflict  candidates like sabriz  are exactly what is needed on the csm as we move forward into the new golden age of this game
edited my bad post made when extremely drunk
cap stable interview
snip removed a reply to a deleted post isd ezwaledit  to stay on topic jayne what are your thoughts on the new player experience in eve what do you think can be improved upon and adjusted to better incentivize players into subscribing etc
just woke up hendrick ill respond to your questions after breakfast seems there is a lot to catch up on p
good interview with capstable at least the first 34i liked your npsi part and  totally disagree on the major of nerfing highsec why because you do not think about both sides and focus purely on the carebears highsec has been  up enough the last few years youre saying you want to remove all war decs from highsec thats like me saying i want to remove all npsi groups from eve because they are shooting people who have done nothing to them have you any idea how stupid that sounds metagaming 1 ps youve got a new war
will you pay for my sec tags so i can fight you or will you be coming to lowsec
i have removed some rule breaking posts and those quoting them the rules27 offtopic posting is prohibited offtopic posting is permitted within reason as sometimes a single comment may color or lighten the tone of discussion however excessive posting of offtopic remarks in an attempt to derail a thread may result in the thread being locked or a forum warning being issued to the offtopic poster isd ezwal
thats not representative of what i said in the interview wars have their place in highsec as i statededit on the same note as koz if youd actually like to fight just let me know and id love to organize something itll have to be in lowsec tho since the majority of us are pirates and cant even go to highsec in the first placethat is what wars are about right fights
i have another question about how you would handle a problem if it was harder or things turned badly to give some back story when you were in overload everything sash managed our syndicate moons when things got tough instead of working with us you turned tail sold the moons to nocturnal romance and falsely blamed it on a rogue director so instead of dealing with the problem you took the easy way out is this representative of how you would act as a csm rep or was it all a con from the start and it was the long game with meticulous planning that which while dirty and eve related might be a decent way to present it for your csm campaign as having the ability to execute such a difficult plan is almost in line with seeing a plan from start to finish as a csm repso the tldr is are you willing to see difficult problems from start to finish working with those that are with you or will you take the easy way out and find a scapegoat
and thats exactly my point you are clueless when it comes to highsec but still want to destroy it how about you stick with something you do know like the npsi fleets that part i did like about your interview as it was based on facts not feelings
manny is a good man ill be voting for the first time this yearfor those that dont know or have contact with him he genuinely cares about the game as a whole and has the ability to look at the grander picture and see how each piece of the game interacts and affects the various end game routes that players strive to move towardswhether you are a casual player who mines or does missions after work a part time pvper who enjoys fw and the occasional low sec roams or the more hardcore player who pvps daily station trades into the 10s of billions or have a pi empire hell consider how your enjoyment and contribution to the game will impact those on the opposite side of the mapas someone who has played this game since about a month after release in 03 i can honestly say ccp has delivered its best content at a consistent rate over this past year moreso than any previous year without a doubt and i believe with people like manny he can help guide ccp to make sure the right areas are targeted to keep the game fun healthy and in a state of growth
just completed an interview by the lowsecfocused site justforcritschance ravinne quizzedthanks to scaurus for this opportunity
i think the legality of boosters needs to be revisited there is no smuggler concept in the game might be cool if there was but it does not really exist i think the diversity in boosters should be increased for combat since there are only a handful currently if boosters become more used  in turn it becomes a bigger more used market this could open up more profitable pathways for players interested in making these combat boosters with the possibility of the legalities being revisited easier to transport to potential markets as welli would be very open to suggestions from people of what kind of boosters they would like to see and to which extent you can take the boosters ie increased booster effectiveness at a higher level  higher risks of penalty to other ship functions like tracking capacitor level etci am open to hear any opinions on this especially from those who use combat boosters frequently or would like to use them if circumstances were different

hello readers of eve sand box the jump fatigue is here to stay sorry but on the flip side lets talk about the timers a bit more hereto start the carrier supers jump fatigue is a bit high for the first jumpi would like to see the timer get nerf down to size a little bit here current time is 57 minutesreduce down to 27 minutesblack ops and jump bridgesthis adds good game content in the game for sub caps not capital ships herei think both should only be hit at 10 of the jump fatigue thats all for now enjoy
dear friendsno one is upset by the fatigue generated by small ships using jbs the home terrain advantage created by the jb in 00 space is now close to nothing due to fatigue the whole point of the pheobe changes was to generate more fights but after a few months we can see that all the jumpchanges killed the 00 warfare this was a clear mistake a lot of 00 members are against that but i did not see any mention about that at csm lvl every time ccp is hitting with the nerf bat a ship or a ship class players find another ship or ship class to use for large pvp warfare and then the ccp will eventually nerf that ship or ship class balance seems the word ccp does not understand when changing ships interceptors with too much dps some destroyers doing more dps than a cruiser many cruisers doing more dps than all the t1 bc battleships outgunned and undertanked  we see less and less bs fleets except a few faction ones the carrier was the capital ship helping a player to move his ships and assets and now is just a drone boat
so were talking about ditching offgrid fighter assignment you want to take the last useful thing about carriers away from them toois it a broken mechanic definitely how broken is easily illustrated by this kill 
hey i remember this from 2011i fought the secondtolast boss in a coercer i had to ask rookie help chat the prophecy is shooting a wavy red thing at me and my capacitors gone whats going on and how do i stop it because of course i was completely out of cap coercer crippled i eventually killed it solo after fitting my own vampire but it took a long time these days i guess the vamp effectd appear near the capacitor readouti had to ask for help for the last boss and helped out someone else sometime after id done it i dont think its a bad thing that the boss requires teamwork but yeah making it clear that teamwork is desirable is a good movei still dont like that the tutorials and the quest lead newbies into mission running because level onestwos are tedious have zero interaction with others and pay ridicuously poorly im convinced this leads to poor retention my first few months were spent being bored running the same bloody missions until i got a battleship
kinda curious as to where the  that question came from and what would make someone even consider this oo i dont think there has ever been an instance in the entire history of eve that an entire hull was removed from the game and i hope that this was never even considered by ccp
i think xanders question comes from the fact that these ships havent been rebalanced as yet and there is no firm indication from ccp as to when they will be looked atccp has in the past said they want to and that they want to redefine the roles of carriers supers as well as titans from what they currently are but that the devs are prohibited from doing what they want to do to rebalance  redefine them due to the code rewrite being incomplete hence limiting what they can and cant do with them so ccp wants to wait until the code is finished and they can change these ships to new and different roles from what they currently fillon communication and before fanfest happens this year i wish that ccp would stop coming out at fanfest and telling us stuff they have no intention of following thru withwe have heard in the past about tessellation ring moon mining  just to name a few  many many more things all of which seems to have been ditched just give us the facts  tell us what your going to actually follow thru on rather than pie in the sky ideas that sadly might never happen
this dovetails into something that came to mind instead of the active clone doing the learning how about the clone in station be the one actually doing the learning from a loreish point of view this appears to be more plausible  why tax a mind that is already dealing with an active day in the pod when the resting clone isnt getting anything done i was stuck on the cool down issue but making it zero makes it all work
so a highly requested tweak is asked about but no one bothers to write it down what else important had been dropped on the floor
mike is just looking to attend a red hat society ball in drag
we really shouldnt be worried about it being a turn off society is just code for where the high falootin do the dirty doins
clownelegant solution exists will make my suggestion later after ui modernization part iinot even eve players like watching dotswikis are meant to be crowdsourced if you dont unlock the official ccp eve wiki players should make their own no are you kidding cruisers are already the sweet spot that other ship classes need to be balanced to meet
csm thanks guys  for doing that unpaid time and energy sucking jobccp what can i do to have a timeline on the alliance logo thing then seems like a thing that could be done easely in a release cycle  if only youd get the right persons in the sam
also nondisclosed sov changes what could possibly go wrong if we hear the terrible things that you are planning
having heard the plan i think life in sov null is going to be interesting i dont think any of us disagreed with the whole plan just some people disagreeing with certain different parts of it its still in development though
excellent work everyone
or theres the whole rest of the year to use the assembly hall or the how to get in touch post
csm candidate in nda break scandal upcoming feature described as interesting evidence of corruption page 2e information continues to leak on nullsec iteration anonymous source says its okay i guess csm implicated
questionis the pos rework considered to be apart of this or is it separate from it as i didnt see it mentioned at all in the summit minutesi think allot of people would like to see some sort of solution to the 1000s of anchored offline poss that are lying around new eden the solution to which dosent even have to be included in any over all fixes but could be just part of the rapid release cycle ie offline poss could be made hackable which would allow whoever hacked them to be able to unanchor take and use them as they see fit
iirc there was talk of possibly having an external titan docking upgrade for outposts where each upgrade allows 1 titan to be docked externaly per upgrade p to some undetermined max amount so the starbase shield is extended around the titan and is made targetable once the starbase shields are down and can be blown up once that happens
its nobodys fault but your own if you are defenseless in this game last time i checked newbie accounts still had guns trained by defaultno eve is a pvp game and pvp belongs everywhere that includes highsec whether you like it or not aside from the fact that this is a sandbox game not a theme park if you want a theme park go play star trek online stop trying to ruin what i like about this game simply because you refuse to deal with reality
everyone seems to agree that null is broken but can we step back and say for sure how we know thisto my mind we know it is broken because  wait for it nothing ever happens in nulli mean rightnull has become empty of content and the same power players are holding the same positions null has stagnatedin simple terms null is a chat room for friends of ccp big deals who have always been big deals get to sit in space and be big dealswe need to confront the psychology and leadership being displayed here this is not a broken mechanic in fact it is working perfectly well ccp want a chat room for their buddies somewhere they can be big deals best friends forever so ccp made that we call it nulland what is wrong with thatseriously what right do you or i have to tell the good old buddies of ccp that they ought not be big deals do they hurt us do we really need to rain on their private chat room and smear envy everywherewhat about loyalty as a virtuewhat about looking after your good old friends arent these virtues when they apply to usso there is a lot of hypocrisy on display here we all like our own friends we all want to be big deals with our friendsbe fair and be reasonable it is ccps game and their employees look after their friends no harm no foul indeed the joy of special friendships is one of the things that separates us from say plantsfurthermore high sec is full of fun you can gank bears or run missions so it is not like null is some big chat room and the rest of us cant play eve we can play we can enjoy the joy of life in empire spacedo not throw out the good in search of the perfect is my adviceeve is loads of fun and full of happy times for interesting people who are prepared to just get on with it and have fundo not let that go because ccp and special friends want to sit in a massive chat room and have everyone look up to them in awe of their giant shipsmost of all do not expect from a pig but a gruntif there were to be real strategy in eve null the fundamental premise would be an entirely different game wars would be fought for strategic locations and npc events would constantly confound the best strategies of the best playerswhen you see a chat room where nothing changes and the same people are sitting in the same places forever that is no accident that is stasis a condition very difficult to achieve in any dynamic organisation you could even call it a culture
if the culture were to change then whateve null as a strategy game involving wars is not something that is easy to conceivenone of us least of all ccp have any idea how that might look or how it would be to playif we are prepared to wonder we might state some fundamentals and go from therejust to start the conversation consider the following realities of war and strategy1 npc empires would behave as empires2 war targets could be forced to move to undock and fight in order to hold key locations at key times in key places3 great wealth and power would attract those seeking it for themselves including npc empires of course4 those who hold power would not be consulted regarding how others might play the gamein the end null is a chat room because ccp chat to players and listen to them chatthere are a thousand ways eve could be made a strategy war game including increased npc empire actions and reactions to player stagnationthe idea of a pure sandbox where players generate content is both idealistic and vain it pretends that ccp doesnt listen to player chat yet simultaneously pretends players will do interesting things rather than follow narrow predictable avenues of self interestif ccp want a strategy game in null they need to make one they need to do that work to create the npc agendas that drive new strategic challengeswithout this work the traditional work of the dd dungeon master null will only ever be a chat roomwith titans
maybe you should chill and understand peoples concerns your name comes up in multiple things and non of which are taken lightly when it comes to trusting someoneyour attitude just sucks sorry if that hurts your feelings but you seem to have an arrogance about you you vibe wrong your aura is the wrong color take your pick
i am sorry if i offended you i have unfortunately become accustomed to people falsely accusing me of stuff its a sore subject for me
this isnt my campaign i am simply a voter looking to get information on who i am voting for like i do every yearthere are a few things i agree with you on but i simply do not know enough about you and the things you have allowed yourself to be involved in is just very concerning when it comes to trusting someone with my voteyou have yet to answer any of my questions
i am reticent to answer your questions when you keep accusing me of being involved in events i clearly wasnt i was not in iceland when the monument was vandalizedi was not in iceland when mynnna accused me of following him aroundplease stop attacking me for stuff i had no part in if you have questions about my platform or my ideas for eve than i will be happy to answer those
you cant just settle with the belief that everyone is targeting you specifically more than others for no reason at all there has to be a reason for it easiest way to discover the reason behind a string of similar occurrences is to find the common denominator
if you dont have any questions about my platform or csm candidacy than we have nothing to talk about
so we shouldnt condo you in game and talk about anything ok we condo condo you in game and ask about eve related subjects since you obviously hate answering questions
so far the only actual question you have answered was mine and it was i dont participate in any way with the larger community and instead avoid the forums and only talk with my own small group of friendsso again ill ask the second question why does that kind of community interaction and experience qualify you for a seat on the csm
um whatremember my advise about thinking before you postyeah
xenuria you say you lead a large wow guild however your eve corp history reads like a i dont fit in anywhere
you are entitled to your opinion
id still like an answer to my secondfollowup question especially regarding the comment you jsut replied toyou admitted you dont post at all really on the forums by this we can at least infer you dont really read the forums much you also stated that you dont speak with much of anyone ingame outside people who are already your followers basically which i can guess numbers somewhere around 100 or lessso on to the question despite having no real forum presence and no greater eve community presence ingame whyhow do you think you are qualified for a csm position
if you would stop shitting up other candidates threads it would be a lot easier to vote for for you i agree with most of your ideas but dude seriously stand on your own merits and quit trying to knock the the other guys down you are coming off as a bloody politician
you can call it anyway you like it but when a i see a post i do not agree with i will speak up would you rather have a csm member who only agrees with everyone 
i have removed some rule breaking posts and those quoting them as always i let some edge cases stayplease people keep it on topic and above all civilthe rules4 personal attacks are prohibited commonly known as flaming personal attacks are posts that are designed to personally berate or insult another forum user posts of this nature are not beneficial to the community spirit that ccp promote and as such they will not be tolerated5 trolling is prohibited trolling is a defined as a post that is deliberately designed for the purpose of angering and insulting other players in an attempt to incite retaliation or an emotional response posts of this nature are disruptive often abusive and do not contribute to the sense of community that ccp promoteisd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls
ok less a question and more random thoughts on war decsis it not better to give the defenders a reason to fight back maybe give them a reason to come out of there stations or log on and fight back as at the moment there is nothing to actualy make people want to fight back vs war decersgreifers maybe if the defenders win the war they cant get decd for a week by anyone else or maybe concord pay the corp all the isk killed obv if they have been decd by two corps and they win 1 loss 1 they should still get the shield for there winit saves big merc allaincescorps having to have 100s of wars active to get a rookie ship kill on the undock off jita and it actualy makes content rather than something people try to avoid and maybe a isk reward for the attackers if they win funds you spent on the war get returned or something similer which can also lead to the cost of wars being increased so greiferswar dec alliances actualy have to pick targets rather than the dec all button which we see at the moment bountys could be payed at a larger  while at war to the attackers as well draws should literaly be no one gets anything and the defenders dont get there shield bit of a wall of text but what are your thoughts on this as it is in no way a nerf and does not require any new mods to be made for content to actualy happenok question time1 i would suggest double the war dec costs for the first group up to 50 players and let the rest as it isby let the rest as it is i assume you mean leave it at basic cost but should it not be the other way round make the first war cheaper and all wars after it more would this not mean getting the most out of your isk as you are actualy having to hunt that set allaincecorp rather than sitting on undocks all day as the more groups you dec the more you have to pay so the less isk back in kills you get2 im a bit behind on all the cool kid school yard lingo but what does htfu mean and why is it so important to you3 cookies or ice cream and what type
the reason to fight back is to keep the corp  alliance alive that alone should be a good reason if people cant fight themselves they could hire mercenaries or call in help from friends what marmites does isnt any difference then what npsi fleets do the biggest difference is we have to pay a lot of isks for it no isks rewards needed if it is a paid war dec they get isks from the client if it is a fun war rewards will only make the attacking side richer and we would have even more wars i can only speak for myself but sometimes it takes hours to pick targets looking at past results have we decced them recently do we really need to dec them a 3rd time are they big enough we prefer 25 member corpsalliances etc etc and yes we do have a lot of wars then again we also pay for it if you want a lof of shiny ships you also pay for it my point if people are willing to pay the price why shouldnt they be able to do it if for example code wants to gank with battleships and pay for them i say let them who are we to decide what is good or bad when it comes to people spending their isks  1 no by making the first war more expensive you avoid getting to many smaller corps decced the bigger corpsalliances should be able to handle a war the smaller are still in the proces of setting up things resources recruitment etc2 htfu  harden the  up we have seen so many nerfes in highsec the last two years and no buffs to evilness its time we stop this process and even reverse things if people complain about how hard it is in highsec now you should have been here 2 years ago3 ice cream lemon  red berries
the reason to fight back is to keep the corp  alliance alive that alone should be a good reason if people cant fight themselves they could hire mercenaries or call in help from friends what marmites does isnt any difference then what npsi fleets do the biggest difference is we have to pay a lot of isks for it  i suck at this quote milarky and hate fourms well not really war decs dont kill off corpsalliances they just dont bother logging in or undocking or they just on play on a alt when dec ends they can just go back to normal surely giving the defenders a reason to fight back which is more than ehonour would give the attackers more content more than camping undocks and trade routes anyway and just killing off the daft or ignorantand as far as im aware npsi does not need to wait 24hrs to start shooting people nor does it need to pay anything to do so and happily i was there 2 years ago and as far as i can tell its not that much differant than it was back then execpt wars are cheaper now and you have the option for suspect baiting everyone rather than single corps which is a big  in my mind though dec shield being removed was slightly anoying as the tears were great
that happens too and in most cases mercs avoid these corps it is one of the things i look at before we decide to war dec them but most alliancescorps we war dec do have things to lose yeh we might want to nerf that a bit then its so unfair to the players they blob
mercenary corps are generally more able to win a war than the targets they pick both because they train specifically for tht type of combat and because they pick targets they have a high chance to win against the reason people dont fight is because theres nothing to gain from fighting a battle you are going to lose that wont change if mechanics force people to fight then they will find other ways to avoid it they arent going to submit to being fodderand yeah the big question are we at least 95 certain to win this warit really depends on if your gameplay mechanics are too easily at the expense of others as it is wardecs are relatively easy and cheap to run you have hundreds of wardecs yet the fees you pay are low enough that a solo player could pay for them thats ludicrously cheap sure you should be able to do what you want but it should be balancedno by making the start war cost more expensive you make it more difficult for a small corp to dec another small corp larger corps would still be able to dec whoever they want as you stated above many of your wardecs are paid for by the client so if the cost to you went up the cost to them would too if they werent paid for by a client im sure the income you have would cover the additional cost
yes we would like to win all wars we declare are you saying that any other corpsalliance in eve picks battles so they could lose them  if thats true they are doing it wrongpicking new targets brings the risk of not winning a war which is way more fun we sometimes go after targets we know are going to hurt u hint hintincreasing the base price will hurt bigger mercenaries like marmites as 150 x 50m extra is a lot of isks we have to work for first we are not an isksprinter 80 of our wars are not contracts so we can not just increase a contract priceonly thing i do agree with you is that doubling the base price from 50m to 100m could be bad for smaller merc corps maybe we could only increase it for corpsalliance who have more then an x amount of players  this way the bigger alliances like marmites pay more and the smaller merc corps who probably do less damage to a target pay less
try reading no thats not what im saying of course you will aim to win but when your targets realise they cant win and decided to take the action to reduce the impact of their loss the cried go up about how hey should be encouraged to actively defend themselves and by encouraged of course we really mean forcedyou just stated above we would like to win all wars we declare so which is it either you declare wars with the intention of winning or you find it more fun to lose wars and therefore are choosing the wrong targetslets be honest for a moment since csm candidates should be honest above all else you want to beat the enemy so you pick targets you have the highest chances of success against suggesting that you like the risk of not winning is just trying to make yourselves look more honourable than you really are its fine to attack easy targets hell its expected but lets frop the pretenceits 75b which can be nearpassively made through t1 production on a single account or made through trading on a single character on top of that you make isk through loot and through contracts and i also understand that many of your wars are paid for by your members too i dont believe youd honestly struggle to meet the extra cash which is why youre comfortable making the suggestionpersonally i believe war costs should ramp up considerably more as you start more wars so that after making 10  20 wars are so they start to become insanely expensive and 30 would make most groups bustthe reason for that is that groups like your own that simply farm wars dont really add engaging content for smaller groups youd likely stick with having a bunch of nullsec wars your contract wars and a few adhoc wars smaller groups would be unaffected as they would be unlikely to have vast quantities of aggressive wars and overall mercenary groups would be encouraged to either work on a smaller set of corps or break down into specialised corps with that change id be happy for people to be pushed out of npc corps quite heavily if people were just forced out as is groups like yours would just wardec them and wed just see players dropping out as they are forced to not play or submit to being killed endlessly
lucas if you are telling me i am a liar then this is the end of our discussion there is nothing in my replies to you which isnt true and please stop the industrial trading comments i aint a carebear  caps for drama effects 
bam im asking this of most of the candidates whom i support so i wanted to get your feelings on itas someone who has played the game for as long as you have and worked on building communities what are your thoughts on the new player experience in eve what do you think can be improved upon and adjusted to better incentivize players into subscribing etcone point of contention i have with it is it does a very poor job introducing and preparing players for the concept of permanent loss when undocked and attacked by other players or when their ship is destroyed by npcs there is also the problem regularly stated that a new player has no clue what there is to do when starting out it could be said this is because the sandbox gameplay doesnt open up for the player until several hours into the game and beginners tutorial is completed

perhaps youve not been reading this thread since its not discussing the awox changes the point made was that feyd wanted csm members to state that they would automatically reject any change which reduced interaction which i pointed out as an overly simplistic view to take kaarous then decided to once again turn it into a massive thread about him whining on about how people want to remove his playstyleno ccp take on board ideas and consider them for their merits if an idea is good for the game but reduces conflict that may be a cost they are willing to pay csm members should do the same in essences an idea isnt automatically bad because you wouldnt like it a variety of people play this game and ccp knows and accepts thisit wouldnt be if thats what actually was happening realistically this discussion has nothing to do with awox changes and even if it were its at most a part of a gameplay style not an entire style in itself much like how reprocessing was a part of and industry playstyle and that was nuked the fact that kaarous jumps in pretty much any times anyone mentions the word risk jumping up and down and going on about everything as if its a suggestion to remove all risk that is in fact screechingtheres a fairly significant group of people who are unable to have a reasonable discussion around risk in eve as soon as someone suggest something that would reduce risk this group throws up the usual strawman about how removing all risk is a terrible idea and they argue at that for eternityactually if you read what hes written in there he missed the point as many people have on the forums he looked at it from the point of view of protect the newbies from being shot which is not the focus of the change sure hes probably the reason its a toggle but that argument was because there are legitimate use cases for corp aggression not because having a toggle is a lesser changeof course thats what seagull has in mind for eve but that doesnt mean everything should be based around generating conflict on all levels and is certainly based around the understanding that conflict is more than just shooting people if the entire game was supposed to be people shooting each other pve would be removed and it would be converted into a space moba it hasnt though because eve is a sandbox where a variety of people play with different stylesand i get that you want sabriz i strongly disagree that people like him are needed though his campaing in very selfserving listen to his capstable interview and you get the understanding that a lot of the changes being suggested are to force people to have to be content for code
time to catch up on replies starting with the most interesting one imho then the hostile onesi want to address the highsec should be nothing more than a kiddie pool argumenteach category of space has game mechanics that define an identity for that space and in doing so promote a type of gameplaylowsec for instance features game rules preventing bubbles and sharply hurting interceptor gatecamps as a consequence its identity is that its the freefire space where escape is easiest where supercapitals are at their most powerful and rookie systems have their identity set by the rules against nonconsensual pvp and the total lack of attractive resources level 4 mission agents high end exploration sites good asteroids etc this is what make them the kiddie poolhighsecs identity is set by concord concord create an environment where more neutral players can coexist in a system than is possible in any other area of space outside high its not possible to have dozens of neutrals in a system except in unusual circumstances this leads to an environment where a lot of people are willing to undock and act in a system at one time in a way thats just not going to happen outside of cynojammed systems deep in sovereign nullits also space that allows players to operate when they do not have the capacity to escalate fights outside highsec the correct action to take when you spot an opposing force you cannot defeat is to go into lockdown in highsec you have the very real option of using the advantages concord provide the defender in engagements to try to deter a superior force from attacking this makes it conducive to solo play in a way that other areas of space are notfinally you cant trust concord with your safety only with retribution retribution for illegal aggression is certain your survival is up to your choicesi do not feel that the removal of nonrookie system highsec will ever occur nor would i advocate it much as nonsov null provides a competitive environment that is different to sovereign nullsec highsec provides a competitive environment that is different to both  supercapitals are of course seldom worth fielding in lowsec because outside fw which isnt really all that conducive to capitals lowsec offers nothing worth fighting for thats another issue
tim timpson wroteperhaps youve not been reading this thread since its not discussing the awox changes the point made was that feyd wanted csm members to state that they would automatically reject any change which reduced interaction which i pointed out as an overly simplistic view to takeand i pointed out that is not increasing conflict and interaction is exactly what ccp and the csm is trying to do with practically all changes the intracorp agression changes is one example where reasonable people disagree on the outcome of the changes  ccp fozzie and co hope it will get more people into highsec corps to compete with or fight each other and have decided that that is worth the reduction in real existing conflict by strongly nerfing a current mechanism used by corporate infiltrators to attack highsec corps i think and as with all of my posts in this thread i present my views not sabrizs that ccp is wrong to chase the faint hope that increased highsec safety will increase retention rates or get players into good highsec corps where they are more likely to stay with the game the net result of this change is just a clear reduction of conflict and thus content and more csm members than dj funkybacon and ali aras should have taken a stand against it the rest of your post is getting so far off topic i am not comfortable discussing it in this thread which is suppose to be about sabrizs csm campaign and platform although i would be happy to discuss feyds views in a more appropriate forumtim timpson wroteand i get that you want sabriz i strongly disagree that people like him are needed though his campaing in very selfserving listen to his capstable interview and you get the understanding that a lot of the changes being suggested are to force people to have to be content for codeyou are welcome to strongly disagree with a csm candiate and her views that is the whole point of the voting of csm members  so that there is a collection of members that covers the diverse player base but it is ungentlemanly to belittle a fellow player for objecting to a particular change especially one that directly and significantly impacts what they do in the game or other players for supporting any particular csm candidate just vote for who will represent you best ccp seagull is taking the game towards one more full of conflict and interaction not less i think that sabriz is uniquely qualified to provide feedback not only on the insandouts of highsec conflict  wardecs suicide ganking and the like  but he also has a complete knowledge of industry and corporation mechanics that will be invaluable for assessing the strengths and weaknesses of the changes that are coming you can disagree or put your head in the sand and think that changes that reduce interaction are going to be implemented but we are entering a time of reduced influence of the empires and increased conflict aka hard core pvp action in new edenccp seagull wrote eve online is not just a game  its one of the worlds most ambitious living works of science fiction the eve universe is a canvas for some of the most hard core pvp action in the gaming world player driven stories of epic dimensions that mirror humanity in both amazing and disturbing ways and individual stories of exploring this world and achieving personal goalsas we take the next steps on our journey with eve online we will continue to create an amazing demanding game experience that challenges intelligent people to master what the universe offers but now we are also questioning old truths and the rules that govern the new eden universe and we are doing it in line with the vision we presented at fanfest 2013 in reykjavik that vision is about giving players in the form of their immortal capsuleer representations more power over this universe than ever before this journey starts with eve online rubicon and will unfold over the next several expansions to eve online
as for tims commentsfirstly the removal of awoxing isnt something that can be compared to the reprocessing changes im aware of people who used the old reprocessing system for two things1 exporting minerals from highsec to null via module compression i did this and own several blueprints that were acquired solely for this reason that are no longer being used and2 reprocessing arbitrage  buying up meta items that have littleno merit as modules and melting them into minerals1 was replaced with ore compression different system same overall result a few losses were suffered as a result including me getting stuck with a bunch of now worthless blueprints but its not a playstyle being removed2 remains viable the prices of the modules where supply exceeds demand have just fallen to a new price point driven by the new reprocessing valuesso that playstyle remains viable its just a bit less profitable than previously awoxing is probably not viable at all although i certainly have ideas to sow terror among corp recruiters unfortunately these are less viable for new players than the ten hour hero wasnow to address the claims that new players will benefit from increased trust from recruitersmost career awoxers will likely change their playstyle to become corp thieves which means that new players will be less trusted in corp applications than they are now it was easy to defend yourself from an awoxer  you only needed to carry ecm drones on noncombat ships in corporations with open recruiting corp thieves are more dangerous and much harder to defend againstother career awoxers will engage in various methods to get blues shot in highsec ive devised a few these will catch a lot more newbies in the crossfire than awoxing ever did expect a lot of newbies to lose ships as a result of the actions of disloyal corp members over the next few months than happens nowthe ability to be a disloyal corp member is a key drawcard of eve the guiding hand social club heist was the first time i heard of eve the recent all reps on cain incident bad bobbys fraud  events like those drive interest in the game and as long as disloyal members of a corp can do damage any sensible recruiter will take precautions to be as certain as possible that the new player they recruit is not a veteran masquerading as a newbie and they will take actions to mitigate the damage a disloyal member can do finally whats been ignored by ccp mostly is the farreaching implications of increased safety for career highsec players because the current csm either dont understand the issues or dont care about them as awoxing was pretty much the only viable way to kill a mission marauder its a dramatic increase in safety for that type of player the csm needs people that can pick apart proposed changes to see what the unintended consequences of them will be not people that accept or worse push for every change that claims to be intended to benefit new players but that actually is aimed at benefiting a specific subset of veterans
jen is running his own thing for me there is more to the subject as a short answer i would say i would say i wouodnt mind if a cloack burned fuel or would be more vulnerable over time too probing or landing closer on grid with i dont see putting afk cloackers over a region with accounts that are active 2357 as a emerging gameplayon the other hand cloacking i often use for intelligence gathering i have guys twich streaming me undocks as fc and support pur amazing italian ossim bomber wing which use cloackscynos are for me in a ok place the serve a utility purpose and i dont see any game play or vast improvements ofc u can invent silly mods that cycke faster or more pricy ships where normal is quicker and so on but woudont be high on my priority
could you comment on this please
cagali not only knows newbies and how to teach them he knows how to get others excited about newbies and how to teach them  as evidenced by players like myself who devote their playtime to teaching newbies as wellthe new player experience is easily the single area of eve with the most potential for growth and improvement in all my travels ive never met a man more suited to this monumental task than cagali he taught me he taught me to teach others and im confident that on the csm hell be able to teach ccp a thing or two thousand
cap stable interview
thanks for the opportunity to speak
trying to tar others of an organisations because someone else from that organisation was not able to fulfill their obligations is kind of stupid 1 cag
endie ive asked this question of other candidates so i feel its only fair to ask youas someone who hails from a community that lauds itself as pronewbie with its members and developed its own newbie education program internally what are your thoughts on the new player experience in eve in general what do you think can be improved upon and adjusted to better incentivize players into subscribing etcone point of contention i have with it is it does a very poor job introducing and preparing players for the concept of permanent loss when undocked and attacked by other players or when their ship is destroyed by npcs there is also the problem regularly stated that a new player has no clue what there is to do when starting out it could be said this is because the sandbox gameplay doesnt open up for the player until several hours into the game and beginners tutorial is completed
apparently you dont like jokes but you do liking helping me make my point
i think there is something very telling about the way you phrase this question when you say instead of dealing with the problem you are referring to the problem as it was defined in game we were consistently losing fights and were bleeding towers the problem  from my perspective  was that the members of my corporation were not enjoying flying with the alliance and thats putting it nicely what you see as avoiding the problem and taking the easy way out i see as dealing with our problem in the most immediate way possible  that is the problem of my corpmates not enjoying the game i enjoyed flying with oe while it lasted but my loyalty remains to those who fly with me in sashwe were not the first to leave and you were compensated appropriately im fine with being the scapegoat for the current state of your alliance but you should temper your disdain yeseve is a game that we play to enjoy and no one is under any obligation to do anything at anytime for anyonecsm on the other hand is a serious undertaking that was purpose built to solve difficult problems im not running for the csm because i want trip to iceland or because i think it will be fun to sit in meetings during my free time im running for the csm because i truly believe i can make this game bettercsm members have a responsibility to those who vote for them and i will fulfil that responsibility
doom made me change it 
removed an off topic post
do you think shitting up other candidates threads is the the best way to get elected
i want to preface my questions by saying that i was in sash for 2 months with jayne as the ceo my questions will relate to his actions during this time and how they apply to his csm candidacywhile i was in sash jayne you were absent for long periods of time and basically the directors were forced to do much of the day to day running of the corp if you cannot commit time to running a corp how can you have time to take on the second job that is csm please dont quote some mittani style delegation responsewill you be as poor the facts in your statements while you are a member of the csm for example  after stealing and selling approximately 13 cadmiumsr32 moons and 1 dyspror64 moons do you really consider 5 billion to be compensated appropriately to hide your theft that funded your recently acquired titan you have tried to paint overload everything as a dying and bitter alliance however dotlan 
ali aras was ranked higher than jayne on the cfcs ballot last year per noisygamer who is rather trustworthy with his statistics and analysis of numbers she is also not part of the cfc due to being in noir and then suddenly spaceships so jayne wasnt the top ranked noncfc member on the cfc ballothis comment with the ranking the blogspotcom account directs to his blog in case you cared to verify
i dont see the humor in destroying a part of eve and if you want to make a point you might want to explain it to the readers otherwise its pointless you are like the baker telling the butcher how to do his work without even knowing how to handle a knife just think about this and youll understand why i think you are clueless when its comes to highsec focus on npsi you at least have some experience with that
i am not shitting up someone elses post i have an opinion and i am not afraid to tell others about it just because you do not agree doesnt make it bad a good csm will speak up even if others dont agree if you want someone who will only say ok ok ok ok  dont vote for me
jaynecongratulations on what i consider among the top three interviews so far on cap stable it was good enough that from not knowing you at all ive just gone through your whole campaign thread finishing up with impressive thoughtsyou are well spoken logical and you present your ideas well some of those ideas are completely new to me before your interview my entire knowledge of the npsi community was being able to parse the name now i can see npsi as a possible alternative constructive gaming style that can stand on its own or be an interesting adjunct to regular corpstyle play enabling you to have your cake and eat it toowe very much agree that the wardec mechanic is broken and why although youre the first person ive encountered that ive heard say it i also loved your thoughts on making wars a part of a narrative instead of just using a mechanic to randomly shoot peoplewhile i think your ideas may well benefit the npsi community i see them as having a larger scope as well and could be very interesting in a csm that will be concentrating on corporations and nullsecyou are on my high list for voting for csmx ill probably write a bit later with some specific questions but nice job on the interview alan mathison explorer  industrialist star tide industries
hendrick at the time noir was under the employment of cfc i should have clarified that but to me that point and all the others still stand appreciate the fact checking though no sarcasm
first this is just completely untrue you cant prove these accusations as much as i cant prove them to be false so im going to move on its true i was busier during the months of october and november than usual with a difficult work cycle irl but i sacrificed a lot of other things in order to stay active within the corp  including having to stop writing for themittanicom ha and youre accusing me of twisting my wordsfirst and im not sure how this is relevant in anyway but the titan was not funded with stolen assetssecond compensated appropriately is a perfectly apt description the towers were purchased using corp isk they were managed using corp resources and when they were lost i sent doom 8b isk to cover the next months lost profits anyway i dont know how much you thought those towers were worth but yall are acting like i stole my titan from youthird dotlan doesnt show that at all  youre either lying or you didnt actually look if youre ignoring the fact that we were the third major corp to depart the alliance maybe this would be almost correct youre still down more than 100 members from when rnest and dboys were apart of the alliance and the second largest corporation in your alliance is currently in a completely different timezonefourth if youre going to quote killboard stats you best make sure you dont pick and choose which ones youre quoting you say that your isk killed has increased from last month  and to my surprise it has conveniently this is thanks to a titan kill that your alliance managed to whore on during one of my npsi fleets on january 3rd such sweet sweet irony but anyway since were picking and choosing killboard stats let me pick one that is not smurfed so easily ships killednot only is this number down by more than 60 since november but your alliance has scored half as many kills as my corporation during the month of january alone yet dotlan which you so proudly point out shows you have more than triple our numbers i hope youre enjoying it there hair loss  we werentlastly you used all of that to try and claim that i wont share true information with the players or the developers i feel like a broken record  if you actually wanted an answer to this question you could have read my answer the last three or four times it was asked in slightly different ways in the end no matter what i say youre neither going to believe me nor change your mind youre not apart of the command team for spectre fleet so i have no idea how you would know this one way or another as for never fcing for spectre fleet this is provably  and laughably  false hell i was one of the fcs during that fleet where your alliance managed to get on a titan kill as for the nullsec freeport youre going to need a citation or two freeporting a region of nullsec is something that ive always wanted to do but never actively attempted or invested effort into are you trying to say that someone else coelomate accomplishing something that ive wanted to do discredits me for not having done it myself im not understanding what youre trying to say here pfr acted completely independent and their actions occurred during a time when our corporation was apart of a certain alliance in the placid region what is it so crazy for the cfc to support someone outside of their political boundaries simply because they think it would be good for the game i have literally no idea how you immagine nonnak played into that my only connection to the cfc is through writing for them on themittanicom where i assume they got to know me and liked what i had to say during my articles regarding the state of the game and combat mechanics i have a poor relationship with a very vocal minority so it would seemas for being inclusive and eventempered when dealing with others im answering you arent i
thank you i appreciate the support and am glad that you enjoyed the interviewi look forward to answering whatever questions you come up with
i know you have been fighting off some accusations as of the last couple of replies from multiple people and i am sorry to have to ask you another tough questionbut i feel its my responsibilitydo you support the addition hats into evethis is one of my platforms key points and its important i know your stance
i think this is very important to the future of eve and the hyasyoda automatic transformation system should certainly be applied to characters instead of shipsreal talk tho id love hats way too much of the avatars clothes are currently hidden by the portrait picture
im getting really tired about answering the same questions over and over again regarding my corporations departure from overload everything so from here on im not going to answer those questions in this thread  if you ask something that has already been answered ill send you an evemail including the details of where you can go to read my reply if you rehash an accusation that ive already fielded during the course of this thread im also going to ignore you i dont care if you choose not to believe what ive written thats your choice just know that asking it again will not receive a different answerquestions related to the csm are as always welcomed
stop rehashing the same accusation

jayne i wont ask you a question about it but this i really have to ask this dudeare you serious a merc group was hired out by some goons and thats enough for you to consider ali a goon csm candidateand believe it or not goon candidate lists are based around what the goons think would add the most benefit to the game from their point of view that doesnt mean everyone on it is a goon supporter indeed some are in fact enemies of the cfc but their campaigns contain an element that gets them a vote over someone else less desirableas for jaynes csm x campaign for what its worth i couldnt care less whether or not he took anything from a corp half of the candidates running have at some point or another done something bad this is eve mate that has no reflection on whether or not a candidate will be a good csm member if youve got problems with his actual campaign then by all means raise them but if your objections are limited to i think he was once naughty in eve its going to fall on deaf ears so shushnow i actually do have a question regarding corp lites social corps whatever they are being referred to these days would you be in favour of 1 an actual corp where you must leave your existing corp to join them2 a social group of which you can have one on top of your corp which comes with a corplike interface mailing list channel etc3 a club of which you can be part of many which comes with a corplike interface mailing list channel etc4 something different to all of the abovei kinda like the idea of them but am not sure about them being like actual corps they might move a few npc players out of npc corps into what is effectively a specific npc corp with a channel with people you choose to be with but the real benefit to them would be if they allowed people from all over to join up and play together they could even have the ability to have mutualonly wars which either side can stand down with the 24 hour notice to encourage people to fight each other for fun
manny what are your thoughts on the new player experience in eve what do you think can be improved upon and adjusted to better incentivize players into subscribing etcone point of contention i have with it is it does a very poor job introducing and preparing players for the concept of permanent loss when undocked and attacked by other players or when their ship is destroyed by npcs there is also the problem regularly stated that a new player has no clue what there is to do when starting out it could be said this is because the sandbox gameplay doesnt open up for the player until several hours into the game and beginners tutorial is completed
i disagree with only a few of your points lowsec offers a permanent docking solution to groups too afraid of centralizing all their assets somewhere vulnerable or committing to the sov game in null with the best excuses given being flexibility play schedules that cannot be influenced and freedeom pretty good damn reasons imoonce again the argument that not all lowsec is fw is bad as most of lowsec that is populated by pirates that happen to be within these regions that fw takes place in fw is the beating heart of lowsec that is the plain truth of it lowsec is big try taking a stroll down those nonfw lanes and see how busy they arelowsec should have a cap of 300 pilots on corp offices with a limit to one corporation of each alliance being able to pull an office at any given station these demands are pretty realistic another part of lowsec is the moons you did not mention that in any of your answer snuff shadow cartel pl and even goons have moons in low with 1010101 mainly having poco domination in essence by an indie corp with a funny namethe sigs are pretty profitable but again many nonfw entities farm these the increase of available indie slots changes little for us a refining bonus and manufacturing bonus would be amazing but they would be taken advantage just like the science slots were before teams came out by nonfw parties if they are not specifically available to those that dump their earnings for the upgrades
problem with the ishtar is that people fight the ship you dont fight the ship you fight their drones removing 125m3 from its active drone bay would be enough its versatility is in being able to abandon and push out whatever set is best as a counter during a fight at the very least you force them to back off and mobile depot more drones into the bay as it is you have to do this 3 times if they carry 2 sets of sentries andor whatever else will take up the last 125m3  maybe a 3rd setit is a good ship people just dont know how to fight them when in doubt fit for explosive damage nubs and learn falloff and optimals of each sentry
manny is a great guy that cares a lot for the game and is not afraid to push changes that are unpopular with people if he thinks it will benefit the game he will be my 1 any dayas for questions what is your opinion on the topic of destroyable outposts especially in the context of the incoming sov changes
new player experience  yes as in easy start for new player not realy a n00bie only areaoccupancy based sov  anything as long the masses are happyplayer operated starbases  any change that makes me start using them would be nice and maby adding new activities related to them tooship balance  iteration  t3 rebalance yes minutes say about ehp nerf ccp fozzie also added that the effective hit point ehp affecting subsystems are also going to be toned downnullsec industry  what does the null actualy lack in this case it got moons for moon mining it has ores thay even buffed the high end one in that way so they give low end minerals too you got unlimited slots what does it lack  is it to dangerous move the mats betwen stations its null nerf jf in such way that it forces blocks to produce in there space lowsec  lowsec isnt only fw space
you seem to be good at pr and marketing but can you tell me what experience you have with eve how long you been playing the game and some opinions on hot eve topics 
as a past member of my rvb fleets back in the day khador and i have had some good times i will vote for you when ccp announced changes with corpaggression my first tears were shed for rvb so many events like the massive ffas will be lost i am glad you are running for changes to the system
ishtars700 dps crusiersthey go freaky fastsit far away from your enemiescapstable running mwdstrong trackingpls no
i forgot to link the just for crits interview i did a few weeks ago but its at
so as previously pointed out you only attended 5 csm meetings during the winter summit care to explain why we should vote for someone who doesnt attend
you should vote for someone who attend the meetings where he feels that he can actually contribute with stuff besides we get recordings and minutes that are not redacted and sometimes irl work gets in front of spaceship politician work
correct me if im wrong but am i supposed to interpret this as you considering the topics you chose not to attend as irrelevant and unimportant
every meeting listed is relevant to the game disappointed to hear you say that i simply cant vote for someone this closed minded
not to detract from the discussion of your involvement with the csms role at the summit meetings but i had a question for you gorskias someone who has played the game with a wide variety of player groups what are your thoughts on the new player experience in eve in general you are currently in rvb which is to some a solid starting area to learn the basics of how pvp works in eve what do you think can be improved upon and adjusted to better incentivize new players into venturing down the path of pvp and eventually subscribingone point of contention i have with the tutorials is that it does a very poor job introducing and preparing players for the concept of permanent loss when undocked and attacked by other players or when their ship is destroyed by npcs there is also the problem regularly stated that a new player has no clue what there is to do when starting out and simply runs missions and so forth as commented on by ccp rise at eve vegas it could be said this is because the sandbox gameplay doesnt open up for the player until several hours into the game and beginners tutorial is completed your thoughts
corporation verge of collapsewh csm meeting scheduled in advance not relevantguess that is all there is too know about this csm x candidate
having known gorski for some time i just have this to sayto me small gang and solo pvp is everything in eve i also strongly think that it is the genesis to 99 of the content found here the complexity nuancethe tactical and strategic depth found in this amazing game are nothing short of jaw dropping sadly i feel that 99 of the eve playerbase including the csm doesnt see or understand this gorski is the only csm candidate that i would fleet with having flown with him many times i know for a fact that he understands he like me can see the importance of solo  small gang and from what he has been doing with the csm i strongly believe that gorski is our man
you know jayne i wanted to vote for you then you you did this you took all that moronic stuff seraph always spouts and tried to top it how about you stay off other candidates threads and stand on your own
the new player experience is kinda lacking at the moment i know ccp rise are working on it and ive seen some prototype images that look a bit better getting people into solo and small gang is harder though this is a mmo and people want to be social and just shoot stuff while talking to their friends going out alone can also feel frightening since you dont have anyone holding your hands etc in most cases you are also going to lose isk doing it with no srp that you get in bigger fights honestly i think that people who go out solo must want to do it themselves and get better at eve i belive that things like garmonation or any other pvp video made more people try solo pvp then any guide or tutorial will do the barrier of entry is not actually that high to solo but there are some things that the new player experience never teach manual piloting tactics such as slingshotting or moving to maximize tracking are never taught and those are learned by practice and searching youtube tutorials i think ccp should push pvp videos a bit more and they are doing a great job by adding some in their devblogs i think ccp needs to push lowsec and faction warfare more for smaller scale and beginner level pvp the problems right now with these is that either you lose sec status fast and is punished by not having access to highsec as a new player or your standings get  from faction warfare and thats even harder to fix
corps aside this game is divided by user interest regardless of greater organization we all have out niches that really make eve worth logging intocsms while having their focuses are in the csm to make the audiences of their respective interested heard regardless of content it is your job to make those meetings you are a voice for people in this game they voted for you and they stand behind their actions i myself am one of them unfortunately you will be losing my vote this coming election it is you job to make those meetings and put in your perspective that is why you are on the csm not only do you now argue that your actions are justified you brag and push off questions regarding your lack of commitmentcontinually why would you assume that whs are not perfect places for small gang pvp you should be ashamed of yourself i am ashamed that i voted for you
if he had as he implied real world work to attend to which you know makes sure he has a roof over his head etc you cant really get mad at him over that choice he also stated there are nonndad notes for him to review and he has the means to talk to ccp about those topics in secure venues after the meeting took place it appears to have been a decision between a meeting about internet spaceship pixels so as to appease privileged people like you and i or sort out real world issues that could include making sure he has a roof over his head at night not everyone on the csm can be a trust fund baby
are you equally ashamed of voting for mynnna a guy who does a ton on the council but also couldnt make any summit meetingsit is no secret that i am not a fan of small gang pvp in wormholes due to the mechanics with how wormholes work you need to split your gang up and cover both sides most of the time you cant sacrifice 23 guys to control both sides there is also a bigger barrier of entry to small gang lowsec pvp such as probing logistics and finding fights i think thera really helped wormhole small gang pvpers and general roaming small gang corps having stations makes logistics easier and the massive numbers of exits have made me and my corp move into thera and base out of it for roaming my definition of small gang is less then 10 people often 5 or lessso short answer for why i am not the biggest fan of wh small gang pvp the fleets you run into are not easily engage able by my gangs and i get more content out of low and 00 space now im not saying how small gang pvp in whs are non existant just not perfect in my eyes we will see what happens after the t3 rebalance
reading through csm winter summit minutes and i can see xander is definitely very if not the most involved with the decisions and discussions he is always there asking questions giving suggestions from what ive seen i can say that he really takes his job at csm seriously and not afraid to take responsibilityyou earned a place in my ballot also if you check his lines in those minutes he is bold with the topics and questions definitely the csm we need and the csm ccp deserves p
xanderas someone who works with me on the eve101com project what are your thoughts on the new player experience in eve in general what do you think can be improved upon and adjusted to better incentivize new players into venturing down the path of pvp and eventually subscribingone point of contention i have with the tutorials is that it does a very poor job introducing and preparing players for the concept of permanent loss when undocked and attacked by other players or when their ship is destroyed by npcs there is also the problem regularly stated that a new player has no clue what there is to do when starting out and simply runs missions and so forth as commented on by ccp rise at eve vegas it could be said this is because the sandbox gameplay doesnt open up for the player until several hours into the game and beginners tutorial is completed your thoughts
xander is legit a great guy you will get my votes
sup hendrick cheers for the questionthe npe was a huge topic of conversation at summit it clearly needs improvement theres no shocker there not gonna lie  regarding your loss comment i completely agree however it didnt really come up at summit i think your second comment kind of brings up the bigger issue which isnt just teaching players the basics its pushing them in some kind of direction in eve the tutorials do a bad job of that at the moment ccp showed us some very cool ideas for where they could go with this in the future we made very clear that ccp should actually go and do these things i hope they do if they do i think the npe will be so much bettersorry for being vague but yeah ccp are aware of the issue they have some very solid ideas on how to solve it and i hope they follow through
the session just before sov was about structures
just read the part about wormholers wanting a bigger room on fanfest please give the little things meetings a bigger room too last 3 fanfests the room was to small schrUFFFDdingers missile i dig it  makari aeron
wordmy dot at the center of concentric circles just isnt doing it for me anymore  plus all the incredible youtube videos showing colored brackets is a headscratcher for just about everybodyalot of what made this is eve great beyond the awesome comms was seeing actual shipsjust sayin
i agree seeing your environment is overrated we should just use our imaginations to visualize conceptually what the readouts meanoh wait isnt that called a mudseriously though what would this game be like if you could only zoom out to like 10k or somethingscary thoughtour handy camera in my view actually breaks immersion quite a bit and makes no sense physically from a physics perspective and is way too convenient
from redditit relies on some factors yes worm holes can be close to the sun and dscan can be quick if there is a resident afk cloaker they can go right to the perfect spot directly for miners there is the day dreaming factor you relax slow down have to find and click the right book mark or thing from the overviewthe attacker is jazzed up full of adrenalin and intent aimed right on the huntminers will have slower reactions just how humans work
posting in a thread where people complain about well planned attacks workingwithout cloaky ships and cynos you get large portions of 00 where carebears and botters can sit around all day and make isk without any risk local lets them know when they enter system intel channels let them know when the enemy is 10 jumps away and thus they can dockpos up and bears roll in isk minimizing pvp
regarding newbies and the bloodlines
i oppose two of your platform issues so i must be in code
jen is a troll  marmitejen would be a terrible csm member  codethat is essentially all they said there was nothing to discuss you actually make a stance dradis that i can try refute or negotiate with you about it frigates are easier to kill and disrupt the cyno they light i would actually prefer if t3s couldnt cyno
yes this tactic i have seen in person in a systemwhile i do like it for its simplicity it does hamper game play and pvp fights they know what we deploy to fights and can counter it long before we are encountered it also hampers pve and mining ops we cant mine well with good efficent ships or rat in good efficent ratting shipsgenerally cloaking should use alot more cap or a fuel source
they know what we deploy to fights and can counter it why would a small group want to go head to head with a sov holding alliance such as yourselfstop moving so i can hit you come on
again i have to question your null sec knowledge
considering ive been involvedbeen writing about 00 for the past 3 or 4 years i think your question says more about you
clear example pops to mind they had less than 20 guys in their corp and gave us hell for a long time they knew how to uses the mechanics yes some multiboxing and their pilots effectivelywhat they did can easily be achieved by 50 determined guys look at the recent solar system that was reclaimed by a small group so again you seem rather ignorant from my perspective
yes im ignorant of the carebearwant to turn eve into a theme parkwant pvp to be optional perspective
that is a copoutin response i direct you to thisi am trying to get orcas and rorquals into mining belts and have more fights so seraph does that sounds like your typical carebear the strangest thing of all is that there is so much antiafk hate for miners  and yet  let us defend afk cloaking like they want to take our air away
about the afk cloak issue i donUFFFDt think means to uncloak ships at will would be good that goes against the idea of cloaking ships for espionage or safe transporton the other side having camping pilots who just log in and cloak in some safe spot and goes away is against the idea that the game is meant to be playedso some risk should be added for balancea simple solution would be to have a timer so that the ship would decloak if no orders were given to it afk it can be a long one12 hours and with some sort of early warning so the pilot can react to avoid decloakingif some structure solution would be the way it could be something like an particle emmiter with a very low percentage to decloak ships in pulses hardly effective to decloak active ships at will but could be a threat for afk cloakers just suggestions anywayof course those wouldnUFFFDt work with the new recon ships dscan invisibility but this is another issue
boosts only work when ship is on grid bam solved
so the orca  rorqual stays out of rat range keep aligning between two poses or safe points has a cloak and runs away as soon as a red is within 35 systemsthat is if people do not stop using boosters stop mining all togetheryou put 2 seconds thought into that post like all the others rightthis is probably along the sort of lines that is the best compromise much like the fuel to cloak ideas however there are a lot of ways to seem like you are at the keyboard when you are not like attach a pencil to a fan and have it tap a key over and over even if you have to have someone sit on a structure and flip it on to decloak people while others hunt and you can only do that every 510 minutes per system at least it means you remove the afk cloakers
boosts dont work if youre cloaked are you fing seriousso if we got rid of afk cloakers suddenly orcas would be in belts becauseno one is going to stop mining all together if people stop mining profit on mining goes up thus people will go mining to get that isk2 seconds is about twice as long as you seem to have put into your campaign
its been interesting talking to alliance members as to why i endorse you being on the csmi took a poll as to how many code people have used your tools and it was surprisingly large whether its us building light neutron blaster iis or getting tags for highsec legality even we use them a lotnonetheless i did take the liberty of getting alliance leadership to throw in a wardec toward you
sarcasmyaysarcasmguess its time to shift transport to redfrogpush and get some fittings for the small stockpile of cyclones the price didnt change as much as i hoped
i would be interested to hear your opinion on dec dodging as well as any thoughts you might have on making concord less of a binary uninteractive mechanic
concord exists to define highsec unlike other npcs they are the embodiment of a mechanic that mechanic exists to stop newbies and people who prefer to play the game in a more solocasual fashion being strangled on the vinenote solo doesnt mean doesnt interact with people its doesnt want to have to depend on other people and doesnt want to have people depending on them im fairly happy with where it exists at the moment weve seen in the past what happens when its less than absolute see siege of yulaiwardecs are a complicated subject there needs to be a way to force conflict in highsec so for example moons can change hands decdoging indicates that the corporation had nothing to hold the players in it thats something id like to change a benefit to staying with an established corporation rather than disbanding and reforming any other approach will lead to people just not playing which is less than ideal it happens even now people get decced then dont log on for a week until the wardec goes away this sucks both from a gameplay perspective and from a business perspective you cant force someone to fight you can only make it worth their time and then you run into the situation where the war deccer wants to fight so may maintain a wardec if the target fights back which makes the optimal route to hideas i said a complicated subject no simple fix for itas an aside grrr youre a bad person sabriz forcing me to fight the pos system to get defences online
removed some off topic posts
so its end of discussion because you cant responds as you know full well the changes you suggest would be minimal in impact on you despite your claims to the contrary the last thing the csm needs is someone like yourself looking out purely for their own interests above the needs of the game if you arent willing to look at things from other peoples views and youre going to try to put down other csms by shitting up their threads then why dont you just do the whole game a favour and withdraw your campaignand yes you are a carebear you just operate in a different way you are easily as risk averse as any highsec miner and you push for changes to further benefit yourself with no regard for how it affects others so yeah thats pretty much carebear
yes
im sure that attitude will get you very farok questions for the csm candidate1 why is it you want change which primarily benefit your playstyle at the detriment of others2 how do you explain that your campaign has vastly changed direction since youve started it it seems that you pretty much just say what people want to hear rather than having a solid vision yourself which is not really a good attitude for a csm candidate3 how can a leader of a group which is as risk averse as any other highsec carebear and twice as selfserving claim to be for adding risk4 do you believe csm members can be dishonest you suggest changes which will make it harder for small independent groups to declare war while minimally increasing the price for yourself you are using that change as a cost so that people find it more acceptable to be in favour of your real idea which is the addition of dreadnaughts to highsec which would allow you to dominate structure combat in wars undoubtedly going after as many research towers as you can

im not im not talking about a single change the topic of discussion is not awoxing no matter how many times you guys bring it up what im saying is that a csm whos approach to all changes is reject automatically if they reduce conflict is not a good approach to haveand i think sabriz is qualified only to serve his own interests clearly he doesnt even acknowledge the existence of other types of players as his campaign outline makes clearmarketing propaganda eve is a game a moderately alright game at most and theres nothing about it that would make it hard core its insanely easy to recover from losses passively so it allows scams and unwanted pvp thats not what makes a game hard core on top of all that its got a gradually disintegrating developer and a shrinking community thats becoming more and more taken over by toxic hatedriven players by the dayat the end of the day eve is field with all types of player if you really think the game is going to shift towards favouring a single playstyle youre kidding yourself which is why there are many changes that have gone through and are on the way which have not involved increasing how much players shoot each other as with most games players like yourself claim you want conflict but you only want conflict against players who dont want it because they are easy prey if the game shifts too much focus to shooting each other they lose the prey and then the aggressors get bored and quit if ccp had no intention of supporting other playstyles im sure theyd remove them
awoxing also remains viable which is the point you can still join a corp and rob them you can lure them into war targets you can even lure them into lowsecnullsec and shoot them yourself the only thing you cant do is shoot them in highsec just like the reprocessing changes its only one part of the style thats goingthieves can be guarded against with roles and sure there were ways to protect yourself if you assumed that people were going to be awoxers but why would you set up a corp and have a whole list of things to do to avoid being awoxed when you could simply slap a minimum sp barrier on and get rid of the chance of recruiting a fresh awox altim in full agreement that behavioral changes also make awoxing difficult but you cant patch behavior people havent been recruiting they have been putting in minimum sp barriers no amount of jumping up and down and telling them to recruit noobs will make them actually do it so ccp is removing that risk so people can more freely recruit noobsim sure some will at first but now theyll have to go out of their way to do it and use much more complex techniques so it will still be less of a risk to recruit noobs essentially your argument here is the terrorism argument if you make this change im going to blow up even more people than beforeexcept that player already could have increased safety most are in their own alt corps go ahead try to awox this character if you get into the corp ill even undockyou would only push for changes which benefited your playstyle though your interview on capstable makes that abundantly clear you want to force more people into combat regardless of whether or not they enjoy that playstyle you want to create a more target rich environment which is great if youre the one shooting but not so much if you are a target the csm needs people who will consider all players needs not just what benefits themselves
even csm member steve fuzzysteve ronuken industrialist extraordinaire gets that every change to the game should be primarily considered as to whether it increases or reduces confilct of course the reality of eve is complex and people can disagree on the outcome of a proposed change as the intracorp aggression mechanics have shown but it is completely reasonable and good for the game for ccp and the csm to ask themselves if a proposed change is going to increase or decrease conflict overall in the game and reject those that will reduce it straight outthe csm needs more members that understand eve at its heart is about conflict like sabriz and steve do what the csm does not need are more wishywashy csm members who are willing to water down the unique aspects of the game to try to make eve into something it is not for allcomers i am all for changes that make the game better and more accessible to new andor casual players but not at the cost of reducing the conflict and competition that is at the very core of what makes this game such an engaging and unique experience ok i have had my say on this if you want to discuss this further lets make a thread in the csm subforum and we can ask what the other csm members think or if you have an actual question for sabriz you can continue this discussion with him here
regardless of whos agreed to it in principle its a dumb idea what your saying is that regardless of what benefits and idea may have or what other ideas its consideration may lead to that an idea put forward which reduces conflict should simply be dismissed its far too simple a view to take and if ccp ever take that view it will be an incredibly sad day for eveso he doesnt agree with feyd therefore hes a wishywashy csm stop being ridiculous the way you play is not the only way the game should be played and all players should be represented you want only your position to be represented so that you benefit regardless of what that means for other playersconflict isnt at the core of an engaging experience its at the core of your experience plenty of other types of players exist in eve
hello sabriz i have only listened to a small part of one of your soundcloud pieces on wardecs but i like the idea of adjusting the payment so that smaller attackers pay less and corps with many members or corps pay much more to start a wardec i would probably go with higher figures than you mentioned for really large corps and alliances to launch wardecs 140 million is still coins on the ground for larger entities i know of miners who would really like to gain a small percentage of extra yield in return for staying in one player run corp two or three percent doesnt sound much to some people but it would indeed be attractive to most miners personally i would say no one would be allowed to stay in an npc corp after they have been alive for two months and people found recycling to continue to do so would be permabanned do you have an opinion on that ideai dont think the new player experience ie the tutorial is fit for purpose either do you have any thoughts on that one do you have an opinion on the skiff mining vessel in relation to the other mining vessels available in regards to the skiff not having any negatives but seemingly all positive values  i ran a discussion on the forum on this issue initially coming from a standpoint that the skiff was too hard to remove from asteroid belts this morphed into a view that the yield on the skiff should be reduced by a percentage determined by ccp to rebalance it compared to the other mining vessels
i want to highlight that being a corp thief does not show up on your api or your killboard oh sure you might see that they withdrew x isk from the corp wallet but what does that mean nothing it could mean a hundred different things corp on corp aggression awoxing is very easy to spot on killboards if you just look for it catching awoxers is about to get a lot harder
new player experience does indeed need work some detailed fitting tutorials like heres a fit for pve and why it works heres a fit for pvp and why it works heres the price you pay for trying to mix the two whether you do it or not is up to you i think npc corps serve an important role as a fallback place for someone that suffers a catastrophic defeat im more for adjusting taxation so that npc corps are clearly the wrong choice for career highsec isk grinders rather than forcing someone that loses everything into an npc corp immediately with respect to the skiff i think it serves its purpose well as the tanky mining ship that can fight back what it does too well is the actual mining its yield is close enough to that of the mack and hulk that taking the risk of fielding a nonskiff exhumer is not rewarded not sure on the exact numbers but i would support a change that went along the lines of 10 skiff yield 5 mack yield 8 hulk yield i feel that using nonmining scouts and a hulk fleet should be viable whereas at present its usually more sensible to have your whole fleet in skiffs with one orca
exactlyi am trying to get votes from the whole of the eve player base most of cores support comes from provi bloc and some other alliances which is the smart way to become a csm it is more guaranteed votes and far less effortheads up corepeople do want as complete a list of the things you have done this last year as possible without breaking nda your name and lazy are being thrown together far too often from all over reddit this forum other forums youtube et cetera please refute them your ideals and the way you help shape providence should remain an influence on the csmthere are also others who are trying to straw man you at this juncture i feel i need to point out that i used to not display what corp or alliance i am in on these forums i have added my alliance so that it is open and above board that i am in the same corp and alliance as corecheck my post history my interests in csm predate even hearing about volt
1 from me
ive deliberately run through the npe myself twice recently it is improved in some ways but the incredibly low number of skillpoints means that much of the time is spent waiting a few hours to train up enough to fit the stuff that makes it bearablei was asked about this on capstable last night and what i mentioned was the gulf between the npe for wow and eve wow is brilliantly planned with very regular wellsignalled and effective improvements  you appear and there is the npc who gives you a mission a few minutes in and you gain a level a few minutes and you finish a quest that gives you a better weapon or armour or wand or something similar a few minutes more and the increasingly addictive ding of another level occurs even playing at true newbie speeds within an hour you have new spells new abilities and so forth by the end of that first larvalstage enthusiastic session you are probably tenth level getting a new trait and moving onto the next zoneeverything is laid out clearly progressing you and ensuring that you are never hanging around waiting for something before you can proceed go back to being a new player with todays tiny number of skillpoints able to do sod all and it is a lesson in frustration and cockblocking
that being said the new player experience does get rid of the people who are not prepared to find other games to play while waiting around for eve to let them have fun you cannot get a more realistic training experience for eve than that
so per your response you would suggest increasing or adjusting the types of skills granted to a player at the start perhaps have industrial pvp etc optoins to choose from that gives you the skillsskillbooks immediately to train as well as streamline the process of explaining the base level mechanics
i think that vastly accelerated training for the first few hours and days of the characters existence might be one aspect of it this has been done before with implants but i think that there is a need for a more guided and rewarding new player experience and one that occurs somewhere that the rest of us cannot get at them the equivalent of other games newbie zones
the first issue i can see with accelerated skills is the abuse eg people making a mass of maulus alts it could lead to though im sure a balance or even subsequent tweaking can be done to stem that to some degree
i dont know if thats really an issue mauluses can be trained extremely quickly asisthe most egregious part of new player skills to me is that you need to wait 6 hours to train into mwd which is one of the most basic modules to me it also requires knowing how useful it is and exactly what to train into which isnt apparent to newbros i wonder if it would be more useful to just let newbros fit neatly every t1 module from minute 1so thats my question to you do you think newbros should be able to fit every t1 module from minute 1 ill leave out extremely specialized modules like bomb launchers and triage on the fence whether to include cloaking devices or not
lucasif you can get past your siege mentality grr goons all day everyday you will notice i was actually in your alliance at one point i also never said anything about being tied to goons being a negative i asked a question which i know a lot of people wanted to know the answer to
having a mercenary contract with an entity doesnt make you a apart of that coalition nor part of a coalitions political leanings hthjayne since this got lost in the kerfuffle of oe coming in an complaining about you in the same way over and over again like a bitter exgirlfriendi would still like to know your thoughts
oops forgot about this question sorrywhat do i think will improve new player retentionwell im going to make this a two part answer first the most important thing that ccp can do to improve new player retention is to keep ccp rise and his team working on tutorial and npe overhaul as he presented at eve vegas link here his presentation went in depth into player testing with gamers who had no previous experience in eve and discussed what players were able to accomplish and what they got hung up on while trying to learn the game i wont bother recounting the entire presentation but it really was quite fantastic i agreed with everything that was said and am really excited to see some of these changes come into effect if you havent seen it you should really give it a watch or just go to eve vegas pokay since i assume i cant just defer my answer to the work of a current ccp dev ill include a bonus thought regarding a facet of the npe that wasnt covered in ccp rises presentation at eve vegas although the highlevel ui was discussed i think that the default overview is something that really is in desperate need of a overhaul ccp karkur has done a great job in recent months of patching the otherwise dysfunctional system with sharable overviews but the default overviews given to a new player are absolutely atrocious a single tab literally labelled default with no information presented regarding how to customize your overview let alone that you can customize them in the first placeknowing whats in space is important that much is obvious being able to identify the important overview items quickly makes pve a lot easier and makes pvp at least viable the default overview makes playing this game really hard  way harder than it has to be  and takes a noninsignificant amount of in game knowledge to be able to customize it appropriately i know this because ive built my own custom overview packs in the past and to truly customize your overview to a point where you can actually see whats around you in space requires a working knowledge of xml or more recently yaml there is zero reason and zero excuse why ccp cant provide a functional default overview that contains at the very least multiple streamlined tabs i can only imagine how hard it is for new players to see the beauty of this game when theyre looking at it through cokebottle glasses
number 3 on your list is the closest to the proposal that i agree withalthough there are a lot of voices proposing different versions under a lot of different names the original purpose of the proposal was to give the current noncorporate entities the tools and framework in order to prosper as well as giving players from different vocations more opportunities to interact with one another take for example player xplayer x is in a large sov holding coalition to be a part of this coalition he has to be a part of a corporation which is a part of an alliance this is the primary banner that he flies under now lets say that player x wants to join a special interest group sig within that coalition that either uses specific ships ex bombers or operates in a specific timezone these people could form a club that allows for communication and organization between the individuals who are interested in that type of contentnow lets say that player x doesnt want his involvement in a club or society to be known maybe hes actually a spy for a different coalition a leader of amarrian roleplayers or  worst of all  a lore aficionado and researcher trying to unearth the secrets of the children of light hi mark the idea is that these groups would not show up on your employment history unless you wanted them to ex decorations and would allow you to be involved with any and all groups that you wanted simultaneously  or maybe none at all if thats your thingyoull notice that none of these examples overlap with roles held by current corporations and thats for the simple reason that social groups were never meant to replace corporations or provide an alternative the proposal was intended to be in addition to the corporation system allowing for a player to become involved in numerous activities within eve these clubs or societies would not be able to own structures conquer regions etc for that and anything related to building an empire the corporation mechanic should remains at the forefronttldr  players already interact with one another in a myriad of ways that are not governed by corporation and alliance mechanics i just want to give them a way to interact with each other in a more meaningful way and to help players find others with similar interests permanent chat channels mailing lists community directory fleet finders fittings bulletins calendars give the players the tools and i think well all be surprised with what the community can come up withside note your war idea is interesting and not one that ive heard of beforeim going to have to think on that one more before answering
updating the overview is actually not a terrible idea although not a unique suggested you nonetheless deserve credit for at least pointing it out the possibility to share overviews in game was one of the best features that was added anyway your idea here while decent lays in stark contrast with your club idea and ill show you exactly where things go badhm ok i can follow a bit but then im asking myself isnt this just a mailing list and a channel i mean there could be a way that you can click join club boogy bombers and automatically be added to the mailing list and chat i suppose but its really not that hard to just join a mailing list and a chat what exactly do you get for joining a club isnt this just adding formality to a group thats key appeal is the informality of it allheres where our difference in mentality lies we can agree that there were public fleet type organizations in the form of agony and rvb however bombers bar is really what kicked off the npsi renaissance the group more or less formed together in marchapril of 2012 fcs such as temp epoc abiss eatsbabies myself and others were working with fleets between 7 to 12 people it was a big deal when bombers bar channel broke 50 people so everything was very informal very grass roots and still fairly small it wouldnt be until bb migrated from the north mo and ecp8r in the summer of 2012 to the south hedgp that you would see bb breaking 100 people in channel it was during this time that we blew up with our exploits being publicized through eve media such as en24 fleets were 2040 people on a nightly basis we were ganking the hedgp jump bridge we were blowing up test fleets in delve then cfc fleets in tribute we were everywhere with growth came certain individuals that may have had the best intentions but unfortunately politicized the atmosphere we had councils voting economics it really took away from the npsi concept and turned a lot of the original founding members away including myselfit was just around this time late 2012 iirc that you even became involved with bombers bar so what you saw was an entity that was no longer the grass roots form of npsi you found a highly political and some would say corrupt entity that resembled a perverted version of what npsi was meant to be you never had the grass roots experience to know any different as you directly piggybacked off of bombers bar most of 2013 you were involved in the political version of bb culminating in the redeemer awox of temp event and the coup within bombers bar and true foundation of spectre fleet i never really took much issue with this as venga the parent corp of bb was the entity that allowed such gross misconduct to occur if you would have been a little smarter about things id probably would have helped you do a better job of it unfortunatelythe company you keep gives such great advice their ceo was always more interested in ratting than being an actual ceo long time members such as temp and epoc have finally left as wellso tldr is you dont have any concept of what true npsi is because youre initial experience with it was a perverse politicized version of it not the original your idea of clubs is simply the continued reasoning you follow based on that experience the whole concept is antinpsiis there even a demand to hide peoples involvement in npsi so heres an idea nobody even really asked forso what is the point what does this give you over a mailing list and a chat again just introducing structure for a concept that thrives on being more or less structurelessyou already have all of that
i really like your ideas on this sort of clubs thing the ability to have a more structured form of nspi fleets and provide better tools for management would benefit the community as a whole the idea could be used in many different situations depending on what additional tools could be involved with the club you have my vote 
will your club mechanic be working as intended when the inevitable happens and theres really only 2 large npsi groups and their assorted lackeys a la goons vs n3 
npsi cant be broken down into a 1 major power vs another as npsi not purple shot it literaly means shoot every1 not in your fleet fleets from the same channel engage each other if they run into each other so the idea of it turning into the new n3 vs goonies add in grr goons comment as required is to be blunt silly it couldntshouldnt happen that and there is nothing stopping another npsi group from starting up in the last few months i know of 2 more that have started to great success alone
history repeats itself friendo and to claim that npsi groups are somehow immune to the same politick that rules eve today by virtue of their rules of engagementis the height of folly
well no im not saying there is no politics in npsi nor in your first statement did you even mention politics but they are much simpler as you just engage everything there are no blues there are no reds you just kill anything you can thats not purpleits quite hard for 2 differant npsi groups to become the new goons vs n3 as they can just attack any fleet they run into including other fleets from there own channel im unsure of what point your trying to raise other than npsi has politics regardless of how little
you seem to think that npsi fleets are some ephemeral thing that doesnt play by the same rules as everyone else even in its current form they are far from it and if this csm candidates ideas are put into practice then they add an entirely new layer of beauracracy and efficacy than they currently havewhat im saying is if you add mechanics similar to the ones already in game what will keep what has already happened from happening again with more bullshit heaped on topchallenge mode you cant use because were npsi as a reason
you seem to think that npsi fleets are some ephemeral thing that doesnt play by the same rules as everyone else  well yes thats kind of the point all the other rules that people play by aka im blue to you i wont kill you or my friends of my friends are your friends so we be bros yo do not affect npsi if its not in fleet they fight it thats all there is to it its that simple there is no huge meta game behind it there is no drive for sov or moons it is very literaly your in fleet and you kill what is not what im saying is if you add mechanics similar to the ones already in game what will keep what has already happened from happening again with more bullshit heaped on topwell whats to say that what ever new mechanic they bring out actualy god forbid fixs something and we have been over that the idea of the current cold war with n3goons would notcould not be with 2x npsi groups and happily with the current way patchs are happening why not give it a go if its  if it is crap they can just put there hands up and say oh  sorry this is crap like they did with the indy teams least they can try and see if maybe this is an idea that would workalso im not the op so putting to many questions to me is kinda pointlesschallenge mode you cant use because were npsi as a reason  and thats kinda pointless as the reply really is coz were npsi 
id vote for you simply because you make good vids and you show some fun wh stuff check out my podcast my blog
i didnt vote for mynnna i made a point not too dont assume because of my corp or alliance that i voted one way or another then again you seem to make a lot of assumptions you assume that you can pass off your duties to other csms because your not the biggest fan of wh small gang pvp the fact that you ignored an event because you didnt like a mechanic or a way its structured is the worst platform to stand on when it comes to representation i assume you would attend such meetings and aim to change them for the better not let them stagnate because you not a fan of small gang pvp in wormholes in a nutshell you admit to being centric in your focus not accepting the responsibility to manage your representation of a community outside of already preferred aspects of the game and sidelining your supporters because i dont like whsyou continue to solidify my idea that you are a terrible representative and should never have been elected to the csm
i agree to assume that every csm can make time to fly out to iceland would be a hugely ignorant move fortunately thats not what i am referring too he had the option of attending events during the winter csm meeting remotely you can view his attendance here his clear lack of commitment to the job when it comes to areas he deems uninteresting is what i have a problem with
as a follow up what are your personal thoughts on areas of interest that need a complete overhaul and what would you like for that specifically to be eg making the career choice an immediate thing in the tutorial rather than later on or adding a pvp training zone in highsec starter systems etc
see i have to be careful with this question because i actively now know what ccp are planning to overhaul in the coming months i say something which i know isnt slated to be on the table and i get egg on my face potentially or i say something i know is coming and its grandstandingwhat i will say is that as you saw from the minutes the immediate npe  that first hour or so someone is in the game  is so super important and some of the ideas ccp showed us at summit are fantastic i genuinely think that even more than sov update this npe stuff is utterly vital to the long term health of the game
good duder running herebring back the balance to evenohomo
i am not sure if you gain much sympathy with your campaign if you basically support cheaters
coming from code who are basically eve terrorists lol no i do not support cheating and most multiboxers dont either we do not want to cheat we do not want to be viewed as such in order to follow the rules the rules need to be well defined we need communication and clarification from the rule makers and they need to be enforced correctly and fairly simple as that check out my podcast my blog
i have removed a post discussing forum moderation please review our forum rules before continuing to post or reply
however what ccp wants isnt necessarily what gamers want if ccp aligned more with op and many others such as my self eve would be better for it
if eve did what every other game does then it wouldnt be eve
i dont think he actually plays the game it would fit in with his original troll of running for csm only to try and dissolve it
you do not want to boost with red there you havent read the op i wouldto hell with it  reprocess t1 loot not difficult to prove 
1 so then what does cloaking have to do with anything what are you even talking about2 you dont even know what youre talking about3 of course you would because your mentality is risk averse carebear themepark wowesque
the only time i would like an rorqual on the mining beltif as a bonus it jams covert cynos within say 100km to 150km gives time to undeploy the rorq and allow it to warp  tank some safety from the the covert cloak afk hotdrop hell that currently makes them pos addons
quick everyone lock your mjds onto that cyno so we can make our get away operation dankprovifrags is complete lets all go back to base and talk about how we are all sociopaths irl for blowing up ratters blackopsawaaaaaay how i imagine a black ops drop happens in jenshaes head
thats it youre going on my list naoguys guys chill out for a sec youve both spent more than 2 seconds on your posts and i submit that your points arent so incompatible after allorca can fit a cloak to cloak up in a safe spot when enemies come in system but it loses a high slot for that but if ganglinks are forced to ongrid only then orcas will start going out into the belts if an orca pilot is able to get safe from danger 90 of the time or more thats still reasonable or else it wouldnt be profitable to bring the ship out in any but the most remote parts of space all that remains is to balance the danger vs survivability such that orcas are getting sent out to the belts but are also getting shot down every once in a whilecant we just agree to agree
this thread looks like it could be rather interestingoddly enough the more people have told me how terrible i am how i would be a bad csm and so forth without even putting forward a discussion the more determined i have become to get voteswhen i look at what they do say and who they support it makes me more concerned for the future of csm and eve as a whole thanks guys for motivating me to redouble my efforts
i think there may have been one occasion that i agreed with something you said but what it was escapes me nowi sincerely hope you do not win a seat in my honest opinion you have a toxic approach to many subjects and for that alone its a no vote from medestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i think you misunderstand jen i do plan on voting for some people one might consider to be my enemies there are some carebears whos opinions and views i value you are not one of them
tora and sabriz arent carebears and nor am i my signature is tongue in cheekthemepark themepark yeah absorb modules that are aimed mostly at making null sec blobs more tactical is carebear
carebear is a state of mindand you reek of it
i dont undertand your voting system wouldnt the the group with the larger number of active voters put their candidate in if say goons have 200 active vote ballots and high sec has 100 and they vote against eachc other goons would win by their numbers so how does that change anything
o borat  i just listened to the interview you provided the cap stable podcast i find your ideas exciting and as a solo player im very much on board with getting some csm members that dont have ties to any one large player blocagreed as the eve development cycle has quickened its pace csm too needs to adapt the csm term should be more than enough time to do significant work critics of your opinion have suggested that the csm needs more time the excessive time some have been given is precisely what has allowed their selfcongratulatory and priveleged inner core to develop in the first placein an era of sometimes dangerously personal metagaming im all for increased privacy measures for playersas im posting with an alt right now as are you i cant help but oppose your position here i support the majority of your opinions but i do wish youd at least platform with the transparency youd like to see put forward ingame trust me i dont care who your main is im here because i like the way you think learning that you have some hole five year old account wont change thatbe more specific this is filler nonsenseyoull have my vote
many thanks for the answer for me high secs identity is a total clusterfeck and not something wholly defined by npcs i didnt and dont expect you to change you mind about high sec i was just trying to express some of my own frustrations about its mechanics how i see it harming eves subscriber base and find out if you could adapt to another play style
defending against thieves is already something that can be done using roles most thieves have to put in effort to get themselves into roles which allow them to steal and as long a they have to put in effort not just join with noob point and shoot orca  demand ransom which by the way also doesnt show up on killboards its fine keeping the current status quo where newbies arent recruited as freely just to help the laziest of awoxers is a bad ideaand hey genius they arent changing how corp thieves work so its not going to be a lot harder to catch them its going to be just as difficult as it ever was
im sure those tutorials would be very good if you already know the mechanics im not sure you could realistically turn those into something that new players would be able to read and take away any useful information from the fact is fitting a ships is pretty complex when youre not fitting a gank catalysta skiff already has lower yield picking a hulk would give you considerably more yield something like 30 more picking a mackinaw gives you a much bigger ore bay the reason people use skiffs is that they are the only exhumer that keeps you relatively safe from ganking so you fight for a group who complains about miners using the wrong tools for the job and blowing them up to show them the error of their ways then you complain when people use the right tools for the job and demand they get nerfedand fyi using a hulk fleet with scouts is viable and used all the time in low and null but you see considerably less of them in highsec as gankers can use alts too so its difficult to scout out and incoming gank fleet the few places in highsec they are used are places gankers wouldnt generally look as stupid as it sounds highsec is simply too dangerous to consider using high yieldpaper tank in the majority of cases regardless of the yield bonus with the amount of precautions a corp would need to put in place to guarantee their safety long enough to earn the value of the fleet they could work in null and earn considerably more
i have mentioned and asnwered that question several times also in forums but ill try to show some things  i have been invited to both summit and fanfest my rl makes it impossible to be on most meetings therefor i listen to recordings and work from there i am active on stage at eve amsterdam think i got most forum and twitter in as well within csm with the minutes i ratehr dodge them with my writing but no wurries i do read themi think i am the guy with the a high eve twitter in csm if thats relevant to the statistic dudes also you could watch me at evesterdam where i made a presentation this year next on the list is fanfest and a eve meet in scandinavia this summeri try to keep up with eve mail which sometimes exceeds my ro work email and ingame forums also on the forums we share with ccp you can find alot of ideas and posts from me besides that we use skype to communicate with alot of devs and eachother i ll be making a eve24 about this summit on which i invested a week of my time in iceland with pleasure spending 2 weeks in iceland of my own free time this year cuts into time with wife and kids i am thankfull they support my passionalso ccp asked the csm to make a review of the year which 7 of us wrote something for issue is all of the above are just words follow some links talk to people that know me and make your own judgement and if thats not me thats cool 13 more members in the current csm u can like and for the next election hopefully alot of engaged fresh blood
i finally had the chance to meet core in person hes dedicated articulate and passionate and he represents his constituency well hes also an ultrachill guy and is great to hang around with and just chat dont let compliments from a goon count against him core deserves to be back for csm x
sounds like core is so busy doing the job  rather than constantly proclaiming he is working1
the mauluses were simply an example of a useful ship that could be expedited for a new player to get intogiving access to nearly every t1 module right off the bat would be problematic from a balance perspective it would make groups that cater solely to new players such as yours have a larger mass of effective pilots using the maulus example again you would be capable of putting a brand new player into one of your groups maulus a lot quicker the ship en masse has proven to be very effective across numerous conflicts if you were to buff the ability of a new players ability to access specific modules you would need to nerf the overall ability of those same modules so as to stem any abusegaming the function
i think youre grossly overestimating how much time it takes to train into those in the first place aside from specialized t1 modules like gas harvesters or bomb launchers or perhaps the cloaking device i think it would only take 23 days to train all the skills necessary which isnt that much of a difference if you know which skill books to buy which things are useful which things arent etc automatically giving those skills to a newbro wouldnt give newbro organizations a larger mass of useful pilots than they already have because we already get them with a bit of advice  investment in skill booksnote just realized that also lumped in t1 modules of more advanced weapons like heavy launchers or large railguns which was unintended i meant the frigatelevel versions of potential modules like shield hardeners smartbombs weapon upgrades etc the goal is to let new players fit a variant of every potential build off the bat rather than giving them a partial toolbox and forcing them to look up what skills they need for modules theyre not even sure they need
the point which you seem to be missing is that by making it so a new player has immediate access to all or a large majority of t1 modules you would have to rebalance them so as to stem any abuse of those modules en masse that would affect suicide ganking catalysts the maulus example and so forthas an aside the question and follow up was directed towards endie whose thread this is and not you if you feel like addressing the topic do so in your own campaign threadedit  i know its bringing up the doxxing thing again but it relates to csm 10 in this capstable podcast discussion the topic of having the csm 10 candidates personal information remain private came up after ccp announced that will be the policy do you agree with marc scaurus in that perhaps your personal information should be put out there in order to run for csm despite the current climate of people within gaming in general investigating your personal life contacting your family and so forth or do you feel this shift in policy is better for those on the csm to prevent them from harassment
well i gotta agree with ash i dont think you know how npsi workslike this doesnt even remotely make sense npsi groups arent just limited to pvp how do you imagine this would become so perverted that only two social groups would exist and they would be aligned against one another there are multiple groups in existence presently and there will be multiple groups in the future for the simple reason that they have different interests and interact within the different activities of new eden
thats pretty much what i was hoping youd say and im very much on board with thatit is kind of just things you could already have but clubs could have additional things similar to what corps have  a shared calendar a shared fitting pool announcements potentially a membership list and yes all of this could be made externally or worked around with the current system but the general idea would be to make it as simple for a group to exist and organise content as possible the more tools people are given to help them arrange this content the more time they can spend actually doing it
in this capstable podcast discussion the topic of having the csm 10 candidates personal information remain private came up after ccp announced that will be the policy do you agree with marc scaurus your former boss at themittanicom in that your personal information should be put out there in order to run for csm despite the current climate of people within gaming in general investigating your personal life contacting your family and so forth or do you feel this shift in policy is better for those on the csm to prevent them from harassment
its just human nature you cant deny that its happened in new eden and in real world political situationsthis isnt about how npsi works its about how people work in the political sphere whether its new eden or anywhere else
then why arent there only two incursion communities why arent there only two major pvp communities what about the nonpolitical entities that would benefit from these tools such as purely social groups like bsb et al what about sirsqueebles streaming community everadio or even the antiganking groupuntil you explain to me how all of these groups from all over new eden are going to devolve into a holy war similar to the cfc vs n3 im going to continue thinking that what youre saying just doesnt make sense hell pvp communities make up a minority of the social groups that would benefit from these sort of changes
i listened to that episode last night and unless im mistaken marc was in favor of a system that only required you to reveal your real life identity if you were actually elected to the csm  just running for election wouldnt require you to disclose such information i think this is the best of both worldsfor anything you do in eve i dont think its necessary for you to reveal your personal information however the csm is closer to an actual job than it is to an mmo and the people who elect you have the right to expect a certain standard i think that enforcing real life identities helps define this point and increases the maturity of the council as a whole if your job is literally to represent a group of individuals virtual or otherwise and you cant even trust them enough to tell them your name then i dont know how you can be expected to do your job properlyis it a huge deal or something that i would be up in arms about if they removed nowould i prefer it stay the way it is currently yesmy name is justin conroy im a pilot for the rcaf and i approve of this message
photos of jayne in spandex going for 1bil a pop
thats an awesome photo you cant deny it
i fully agree with this sentiment the fact that the identities of csm members were known reinforced that its a serious undertaking not just a player whos getting early access to info helps reassure the players that the csm members are independent and objective and like you say if you cant trust the playerbase with your information then how can you represent themin addition to that because this will only be coming in now it creates a double standard former and existing csm members who are running are known while newer csm members will not necessarily be while it shouldnt make a difference im more likely to put my faith in somebody who i know is taking it that much more seriously than a random character name
this will be the first time i bother to vote you will get my vote friend
definitely voting for you you have my laser
glad to have convinced you
of all the csm candidates i am probably the least experienced eve player you could say im not a reykjavik insider while i played a twoweek trial in 2008 i couldnt figure out how to warp anywhere and uninstalled the game when i came back this year i immediately moved into nullsec exploration where i learned all about navigating and surviving lawless space during that time i was part of a small exploration corp for a short time and then was taken in by friendly explorers in vale after i got lost one fateful eveningafter learning a lot more about how eve worked i decided i would head out on my own to further my covert ops career i read up on a great deal of stealth bomber strategy including the operations of both large groups like bombers bar and solo play by chessur and ventured out into wormhole space to find targets of opportunity i began my corporation wingspan delivery services and quickly accumulated applicants these were returning players and people who were no longer interested in traditional corps with rigid structures and schedules we worked together to get okay at wormhole scouting navigation reconnaissance and mapping and now were one of the larger independent corps in evethere are many dozens of hot topics in eve and i dont want to waste your time  are there any particular subjects youd like to hear my thoughts on other than the obvious when will we have an ingame mastery track for ship spinning

in this capstable podcast discussion the topic of having the csm 10 candidates personal information remain private came up after ccp announced that will be the policy do you agree with marc scaurus in that perhaps your personal information should be put out there in order to run for csm despite the current climate of people within gaming in general investigating your personal life contacting your family and so forth or do you feel this shift in policy is better for those on the csm to prevent them from harassmentyoud be committing a pretty big fallacy in assessing a persons value purely on their attendance at the winter summit i mean i could use this same line of thinking and say that mynnna was wholely incompetent as a csm member because he couldnt be asked to use skype oncethat google doc of course is a small sampling of only a fraction of what sort of work the csm does to think its a clear representation of who on the csm is actually committed to their role is and i say this seriously stupid
i definitely think that personal info should stay private it was only yesterday when i last saw someone getting doxed while streaming eve and its nothing i support at all i am not the most private person online though and i guess that you could probably get my real life info pretty easily if you really wanted to harass me i dont really see what benefit it would be that the csm members are public people or not its only bad imo
well lets just humor the concept you dont know what ccp are planningwhat did you personally believe to be the biggest area of weakness for the npe as a whole prior to joining the csmedit  on a side subject in this capstable podcast discussion the topic of having the csm 10 candidates personal information remain private came up after ccp announced that will be the policy as someone whose real name and such is already out there what are your thoughts do you agree with marc scaurus a former contributor at your website crossingzebras in that perhaps your personal information should be put out there in order to run for csm amidst the current gaming communitys controversies things such as investigating peoples personal lives harassing those peoples family members and so forth over video games
best for csm by far 1010 would vote again
what are you going to do to make pi less of a chore
i think because it is very much passive income the amount of effort currently involved is finethere are a couple minor changes that id like to see done saving a planet layout so that a player can easily replicate it between planets similar to saving ship fits sharing those layouts between playerspersonally i would like to be able to put multiple command centers on a single planet while maintaining the current limit on the number of total command centers a player can have eg option to have up to six on a single planet rather than just one each on six planets
what are you going to do with the noctis
give it a skin
great so its now cheating to run multiple clientsthats funny to me because that means youre a cheater too as ive seen you using multiple accounts when ganking same for loyalannawhetver and at least half of code

i can represent wormhole space since i have been a large part of thera and use wormholes daily both kspace and wspace i can represent 00 because i have lived in sov 00 and npc 00i can represent lowsec because i have participated in faction warfare and currently base my operations out of lowsec i can represent highsec because i have alts that use jita and run highsec incursions i can represent the small gang community as well as the large gang pvp community because i have participated in both you cannot be all things to all players fisty  choose a platform and stick to it 
you can still can flip to start a fight whats the problem
there would be too many candidates to down vote them all using one coalitioni had code join me in a channel today quite a noisy bunch and people were resorting to convos but i will give due they were rather polite the funny part was what they were saying it almost sounded like thisthanks for the amusement guys
with all the noise about high sec dunking i thought gankers might want to show how hardcore they are
wouldnt hurt to try a little harder to not sound like a carebear when youre a highsec candidate you already inherit a negative stigma and people come to your platform looking to verify their fears and topple you to rise above that you have to go out of your way to convince them that they have you pegged wrong now you can stick to your guns against the hordes of sheeple and declare that their prejudice is not your fault till the end of the world but it will just leave you with about the same level of progress as xenuria or you can take a lesson from the popular highsec candidate mike azariah 1 on my list sabriz is 0 and downplay your being a highsec candidate and instead focusing on inclusiveness and telling them what they want to hear mike wants to be able to log in and mine and hang out with friends and chat but he doesnt call himself a mining candidate he hates gankers and wants em all to diaf but he listens to them and takes a glance from their standpoint he includes them among his followers and seeks out ways to better their experience too after all they are eve players and they have a vote as well as every right to enjoy the game their way
i have ganked there was a guy who had a way of farming newbies not the usual bait cans and such i wont repeat it because it is still possible i was caught and really remembered itsix months later i made a veteran friend and they bought us some pilots and plex to run them between being in the alliance and repeating things said by them about each other and ganking their gate camps repeatedly we managed to tear the rotting corpse of maggots aparti wouldnt be caught dead in a rl social situation with those guysnow this is a story all about howmy life got flipturned upside  downand id like to take a minute just sit right thereill tell you how i became the eccentric of an alliance called voltairein west amarr not born but raised inhigh secwas where i spent someof my daysas a newbie i got into a corp that was quite focused on mining chillin out maxin relaxin around in a belt chatting about politics our lives sharing youtube links et ceterait was very social when a couple of guys they were up to no good started making trouble in the neighbourhoodsomeone had declared war on us they did it knowing that we had no ships or skills to fight back so we had to hide and hide and hide i think half of those original people are still hiding bouncing from corp to corp and leaving as soon as a war is declaredhowever some of us started training combat ships  scary facei do not remember if it was the first one or one of the subsequent ones but they didnt like it and dropped the war not the soft target they expected we started liking it and looked for corps the same size as us to declare war oni think at this point we made two corps one for miners and one for fighters that could join under an alliance of the miners had war declared on themi think my most exhilarating pvp was in 10 to 15 people vs about as many solo fights i dont really care but with a gang you can see your impact in the battlei would jump the gate first with a cyclone and break cloak first be primary then it was onhad to hold my tank long enough for my gang to break the primary of the other gang over heat cap boost orbit around trying to be close enough to be a threat at the same timewe had no logi it was always a case of kill or be killedmy co saw one little worm holeand got excited and said ya movin wit ya corp mates to worm holesover therei begged and pleaded with himday after day but he packed his suitcase andtook himself awayi think he was in there for only a few months before he decide a c2 linked to high sec and c3s were not good enough and he wanted a c4 link off he went to do it mostly solo while most of the ones that had moved to the first worm hole system lefti was mostly solo in a worm hole that was burnt out war declare on it the pos fuel was taken out of it everything stolen and stranded for weeks without a good exit how many times can it link to high sec island full of loot all my ships and you end up being very paranoidit was there that i became very generalised could solo everything in the class 2 with my cyclone salvage analyse hack mine both ore and gas started doing plantary interactionsthen he wanted everyone in incursions i stayed in the worm hole then he wanted everyone to move to null security space as rentersi had a huge argument with him about how he was spreading us thin everywhere and most of us didnt have enough sp to do most of the things he wanted donei had already joined vc academy but i left hw and joined them again in a final parting there was so much antagonism against me for standing up to him and being sensible it was astoundingthe alliance did implode in null sec and i am not surprised in the least it was pretty much exactly as i said it would happenspend some more time living in high sec while i was in vc academy did it basically solo except for meeting up for some pvp operations and helping newbiesi had to take a break from eve involving a hospital  totally fine now i put my walk man on and said i might as well kick itfirst fleet yo this is baddrinkin orange juice out of a champagne glassis this what the people of voltaire livin likehmmm this might be alrightnull seci lead some fleets there is a standing fleet that we rotate fcs in often fly logi in main fleets or in defense fleets scout and direct from a suicide bomber so the things you see on my kill board are a drop in the oceanloads and loads of organising however essentially i would say i am mostly a worm hole  null sec player i can understand and remember how horrible it was at times as a new player especially the time i nearly quit on the forums there is so much posturing and the most aggressive voices tend to be the loudest so i end up arguing against them for the most part and landing up in the carebear seatin fleets jen that is too evil is said quite a lot
im going to take that last line as a complimentid be interested in discussing ideas about rewarding staying in a corp when it suffers setbacksattacks etc as i have some ideas that i think you might agree with evemail me if you are interested in discussing them on skype or teamspeak with a view to recording the conversation and releasing it i am au tz so there may be logistical challenges
congratulations you dont need to run anymore your argument is so powerful that ccp retroactively did thisany ship can fit a tank any player can check the world map for recent killings any ship can stay aligned any player can watch local join an intelligence channel prepull concord add known gankers to a watchlistand despite all this you can never be completely safe and thats fine if you seriously think it isnt you are arguing that a fleet of 10 tackle frigates 100 hacs and 30 battleships shouldnt be able to destroy a tanked freighter which is clearly bs if you are arguing that it should take more ships than it currently does to destroy tanked ships then no that number has already been raised numerous times and people who ask for just one more nerf are followed by people who never knew what it was like before that nerf and then ask for just one more nerf and so on and so on which is why highsec is so safe now if you want to be safer raise your ehp with modules not by crying to ccp that its too dangerousor better yet dont press the consent to pvp button in the station then you will be truly safe
hi john thank you for taking the time to communicate in my threadif i recall correctly and i do when i wrote that bit i was thinking more about also having people having the chance to learn the tools other than having a strange button on the screen there was nothing telling me about what dscan was i think i also missed the bit in the tutorial about checking the map for the killingsi dont recall asking for nerfs did i do that its mostly about not having any way to learn those things other than sitting down with google and getting a headache of course such things as bringing randomness into the response times of concord would be an interesting addition to the fight in high sec a module that lets me destroy my ship and loot if i am not afk is something i would also find interesting stuff like that nerfing one group or the other is not going to change anything that has already been proved time and again
although the exact reason was never explicitly stated anyone who was paying attention could easily infer as to why it occurred and it wasnt for suicide ganking or in game griefing are you advocating an escalation of banning for such behavior by ccp especially in the wake of their announcement allowing the tactic of hyperdunking
hi ashterothithank you for taking the time away from your own campaign thread in order to visit mineno i am not advocating an escalation of banningsuicide ganking is not griefing i am not advocating a policy change here just maybe some more claritytransparency for the bans that take place if you have the energy i think i talked about this on my capstable interview
thanks for clarifying that and best of luck to you
as a fellow aussie im sure youre aware of our daily ritual of getting kicked off the server would you consider approaching ccp to have downtime moved back by a few hours so that it falls in china primetime thus not effecting as many people on tranq
my main worry is at 3 to 4 days you probably dont know enough about eve to do whs id worry people that new go in die horribly and think think wtf and quithaving a later set of tutorials maybe a few weeks in could be a option though
an advanced player tutorial could really be something special it could target players who have been playing anywhere from a month to a year and offer introductions to advanced gameplay methods that many of us never get into due to not understanding how to start

o7i hope like you do that the csm x can have independant voices like myself the reason i am running with my public alt is a full part of my program and if i am elected it will be a clear sign to ccp that players alts ough to become public knowledge as i already said i will be the first one to publish my other alts if this becomes a reality for all playerskeeping alt anonymous is a huge advantage to super rich players that can afford many accounts i am not talking about a handful of accounts but many more and can use those to easily infiltrate multiple groups or plan cloaky afk and paralyse systems or other more subtle ways of influencing the gamethese players use an influence that is mainly driven by the isk or real life money they have access to at least knowing about all their alt is a way of understanding the influence they can weigh aroundfor my own campaign what would the transparancy really achieve to convince you more why would you want my alts to become potential targets to those that do not like my public positionswhat about if i had acquired my main alt on the character bazaaar what would that tell you more about myselffrankly you are better off judging me on the ideas i express here until a real effort to remove anonimity on alts for all players is undertaken by ccp new players could learn to fly new ships in full isolation from other players until they understand the specificity of the ship and its role and choose to undock and explore new eden i am not favorable to have noobs only starting zone like other mmo have but i would like to see a ship simulator training that could be used from within your starting station without having to have to undock it would allow any new player to try out any ship and some fiitting variations and choices by taking a ride into a single instance that cannot be accessed by any other player without spending money or even skill training the simulator would pit the player against some pve particularly adapted to demonstrate the capacity of the chosen ship and the mission repeatable until its succesful completion and could then unlock the next category of ships to train from this simulator would be always available from the starting station of the player even for the end game ships many players use the test server to that effect but it would be better if it was a part of live server experience even if the instances in that case could be run on a different server this is just an idea for the shippvpmissioning training but there are so many more things to do for new players to be taught the different aspects of the games in the order they themselves choseanother important aspect is to not have negative effect like status loss without having been fully trained on the consequences of the actions undertakenthere are a lot of discussions to be had around new players training and there is no silver bullet for it there are just a few bases that represent my train of thoughts on the subject
recorded a show together with mike azariah i am editing it now so expect another great interview with mike regarding his csm campaign and some other random eve stuffill post it when its downloadable
our latest episode of the legacy of a capsuleer podcast is out
i look forward to working with you 
im well aware that skiffs have a yield slightly less than that of mackinaws and hulks but the gap was closed considerably with a recent patch a hulk fleet in a deadend system with scouts on the entrance gate and if desired any wormholes would provide ample warning of incoming gankers in high just as it provides warning of hostiles in null the only real way gankers will get you then is a logon trap which is more effort than its worth or a lapse in your scouts concentration it still doesnt make sense to do so in general because hulk yield isnt high enough to be able to pay the scouton the idea of fitting tutorials for new players  advanced fitting is indeed complex and theres a million and one exceptions to every rule however basic fitting strategies dont mix tanks dont mix active and buffer tanks dont mix guns carry a way to apply damage to small ships fit weapons systems that your hull is bonused for and fit modules to enhance them favor sustainable local repair in pve burst local repair in solo pvp buffer in medium gang or fleet pvp  all of these can be taught as rules that the intermediate player follows verbatim and the veteran can break from time to time
supposedly it wasnt losed that much as according the the game right now a max yield hulk is 30 more yield than a skiff a skiff and a mackinaw are level pegging as neither of them has yield as a primary design featurei just dont think people will get it you understand it because youe played the game for eternity if you told a newbie not to mix tanks though hed have no idea what you are talking about i learned by doing i lost many a terrible fit battleship to npcs and i lost a few ships venturing into lowsec a couple of mining iterons lol to can bait etc knowledge gradually and naturally increased while ganking existed i never saw it happen near me an never encountered it i think if everything was shoved in my face in day one then i was thrown into an environment where nothing i flew was safe and people were just getting blown up and trolled in local id probably have not bothered sticking around im all for teaching newbies to look after themselves but i think you have to accept that they arent going to just get it because youve told them and they need to be given a good bit of breathing room to adjust to eve as its different from many other games once they are in and adapted go nuts
before anyone asks look at the multiple civilian shield booster killsnote this is in referrence to the number of the mods as well as the kms and yes all parties involved assisted the player on to improve their eve experience by talking to them on a one on one basis and explain why said fit was bad they had never learned it from the intro and now they know better the terminal end of the digestive system
serious questionyou often make the claim that highsec is not supposed to be the early game when compared to low null and wormhole space and isnt something you grow out of its a section of space in its own right at the same time however you state that high level pve should be nerfed in highsec and put into lowsec more  like moving l4 missions into lowsec for exampleso why is it you think that for pve highsec should just be a starter area while for pvp it should be the full game surely if highsec is a whole game area it should cater to all levels of play for both pve and pvp thus things such as level 5 missions should occur fully in highsec too or if pve players are supposed to move on to higher levels of pve outside of highsec that pvp players should have to move on too
when did i say corp thieving was changing thats not something i said man i said catching a corp thief in general is harder always has been what i was saying if you had listened was that many of the people who currently do lazy as you call it awoxing will have to adapt and some may chose to become corp thieves and youre correct if they chose to ransom and honor said ransom then yes they are much harder to catch i myself followed that approach hilariously i did not change my bio while awoxing my point was that the corps that were falling for awoxing are typically going to be the same ones who will fall for corp thieves these are generally corps that have awful recruitment standards re my bio and are not particularly a positive contribution to the game society as for the change i understand ccps reason for removing it and i think their intention is noble and their hearts in the right place i just dont think that the change is actually going to accomplish what they claim it is
risk vs reward simple as that personally though im not really all that worried about high sec lvl 4s myself i dont disagree with sabriz on this i just am not as concerned about it high sec incursions on the other hand
i am in favor of level 5 missions being added technically returned to highsec but with very careful balancing of rewards they can if done right be a source of conflict in highsecthey should serve as optional fleet content not as something that is the clear best way to grind isk
youre assuming that highsecs current level of individual pve income generation is balanced in the first placeits not highsec breaks risk vs reward on a fundamental basis with its pve content being both safer and more lucrative than almost anything else one of those things need to be dealt with personally id like to see both of them adjust downward slightly rather than simply slashing mission and incursion income drastically to match how safe it is to do those thingspvp belongs everywhere in eve online pve does as well but since there is a distinct mechanical benefit to pve activity whereas pvp depends on the loot fairy in equal measure regardless of what sec status you are in it must be balanced accordingly
as a loyal provident im wondering the same thing i havent seen much contribution from you in the minutes that have been released
1 the fresh blood of the game is easily overwhelmed brave have done an excellent job of showing new players the ropes and encouraging them to help each other out there are still a lot of things to consider about how new players are treated however
i didnt get involved in that discussion because while i sympathise with daves idea about starting the character off with sufficient skills for t1 ships id prefer ccp procedurally granted individual skills in the course of the tutorial pointing it out and saying now you can use this module now lets do that in your next mission this grants a feeling of earning it it means that it is not instant and it means that the player has to do the tutorial to get these smallbutimportant boosts to new player ability which will hopefully aid retentionthat said daves idea would not be a huge issue and i dont believe that the perennial bittervet fear of being swamped with newbies in mauluses is justified for most of the history of the game players started off with about 750000 skill points and could be in for instance a t1 ewar cruiser in a matter of hours if they chose the right starting build the game did not collapseregarding the capstable discussion of csm players real identities it is not relevant ccp have decided to drop the need to publicise real identities and i welcome that although my own name and information is easily found out and has been circulated in the past and another senior member of goonswarm suffered a swatting attempt in the past couple of weeks i heard nothing at all in that podcast that even began to form any valid public interest in the irl identities of individuals that run for the csm and short of ensuring that charles manson or abubakar shekau cannot stand i cannot imagine one either
this is amazing coming from the guy who told me to stop asking about why jayne was on the goons csm ballot by independent you mean their goals align with yours even ingame mailed me about it
well after actually reading the whole tread took a damn while like 23 hours i find that jayne ive flown with him a few times too with him as fc aka i am kossen jaikka and i think that yes he will do a awesome job to be a csm unfortunatly there is a lot of hate going on about ingame actions that had nothing to do with a csm campaign but here is the nature of eveanyway i hope that he gets there and will sure be on my vote
well i can respect the sentiment but going off of ingame actions is kind of the best thing we have certain csms get elected based on their actions in wormhole space or the economic or industrial side of things what else would you base it off of high school grades field and track records
ever thought about the risks it could bring to them  not everyone has a job at the supermarket where its pretty safe to give out personal info some people are taking a huge risk if they would have to make real life info public does that mean they cant be a csm x  lucky for them leeloo already said you dont have to do so anymore just to ccp
as stated above if you cant trust the group you are supposed to be representing then how can you expect them to have faith in you and i dont believe theres any job where youre going to make yourself suddenly unsafe if your name goes onto the internet besides youre more likely to run into issues if youre super secretive youll probably get doxxed and end up with the contents of your email and your full personal information plastered all over the internetedit oh and yes if your personal life is so dangerous that just your name being out on the internet which it no doubt already is would somehow endanger you then you have too many other things to worry about to be a useful member of the csm
i agree with one aspect of the campaign and that means goals align with mine thats not to say they dont i just havent considered the rest of the campaign much yetalso im not a goon in fact ask the goons and 99 of them hate me like with a passion im honestly surprised i havent been forcefully purged yetas for the ingame mail i sent you that in the hope that youd stop shitting up peoples csm threads with tears about your corp being terrible
it seems like some of the posts here are made to settle personal ingame vendettas while for as far as i can tell the csm topics should really be about the csm campaigns and the topics the candidates propose ive read though most of the csm candidates topics now and i do notice some people really focussing on the ingame aspects and alot of rumours are being spewed a lot of these socalled questions are very repetitive and give me the feeling people are just trolling or trying to discredit the candidates for reasons that are unknown to meno matter the past you had with these candidates it shows a certain amount of immaturity and disrespecti do see a lot of possibilities in these social club things and i think giving a sort of structure to it might benefit all of the people who use them one of the issues i do notice now is the massive amount of things new people have to set up before they are able to fully appreciate the npsi stuff im subscribed to a load of mailinglists have loads of chattabs open and so on and so on it would be a wonderful improvement to be able to take a peek in my calendar and see if fleets are up or to just be able to search for recommended fits through the fittings screen or by opening some sort of bulletin board and yes everything is doable by the current mechanics but sometimes simplification enhances the playability of a game anyways youve got my vote and if you win a seat i do hope youll find the time to pvp a littleps  die a little more still havent got your corpse 
and my cap stable interview is now up
greetings capsuleers i am ashterothi and i would like to represent you as a member of the council of stellar managementa little about mei have been playing eve since 2010 during that time i have lived in null sec been a mission runner in high sec and fought for the gallente in faction warfare as coo of aideron robotics i have also been a standing host for two podcasts and attended a few meetups i currently run a wormhole corp that is taking the first steps into the great beyondi love the variety of activities in eve online i have made isk from ratting mission running tag collecting pi exploration faction warfare and incursions my goal for the last few years has been understanding of eve from a holistic point of view i am eager to learn teach and help things grow the eve online community is amazing and i love to give back to it i am a host of the high drag podcast which focuses on the new player and small gang lifestyles as well as hydrostatic podcast which is more focused on eve mechanics and lore with some of the biggest experts in eve a few years back i also wrote for the mittanicom focusing on analysis and faction warfare i am also the guy who made the tweetfleet slackin my real life i am a software engineer working primarily on android applications so what do i bring to the csmfirst of all i am a strong advocate for revisiting and expanding exploration content in the game i am an explorer and a scout at heart so seeing more better and more challenging exploration content is key to my eve experience large parts of this are the hacking and scanning minigames which have both received some love recently but not enough as hacking remains a 20 project for one or two passionate devs and scanning has only gotten minor updates in the last six months eveUFFFDs other minigame planetary interaction is in an even worse state and while itUFFFDs not necessarily explorationrelated iUFFFDd advocate for a substantial update there as wellsecondly i am fascinated by the lore of eve online and its potential one of the most rewarding things from being part of the hydrostatic podcast was the lore panel that i participated in  recent events like carolineUFFFDs star have shown people are very interested in watching the lore unfold if i had my way the devs and other members of ccp who love the lore would be encouraged and enabled to continue to do awesome things the development of the lore and its manifestation in the game should be an important part of eveUFFFDs development and i plan to support that from within the csmadditionally the importance of having a successful fun and engaging new player experience cannot be overstated one of my early money making activities was recruiting people into eve online which has allowed me to experience a lot of the issues that new players struggle with while many people enjoy the fact that they can kill someone who yet to learn the nuances of the rules that govern the game i prefer my prey a bit more advanced it is important that everyone who comes to try eve are given the tools to be successful failure is an important aspect of the game and shouldnUFFFDt be prevented however success and failure should come from informed decisions and counterplay as opposed to encyclopedic knowledge of confusing mechanics if i am playing chess with someone i will make sure they understand the rules fully before i crush them these issues represent only a fraction of what i could offer as your csm however i prefer to let my actions and words speak for themselves as a member of the csm i would work hard to communicate with you to ensure not only that i am representing you properly but that you know what i am presenting to ccp i also staunchly defend all of the aspects of eve onlines gameplay even those that i have not engaged in or am not engaged in now if i am elected i will do my best to represent the playerbase and actively pursue the best course of action for my constituents and the health of the game here are some samples of my previous works

good candidate
i am pleased that i will have a lore friendly option available to me on my csm ballot but i am curious if you could expand on what exactly you would like to see ccp do regarding lore more chronicles more player events a project similar to aja few other questions1 in terms of developing the hacking mechanic what options would you like to see considered by ccp2 do you have any opinions about the future sov changes that are expected in the next year or soi look forward to also hearing a cap stable interview with you as i am sure they are just about to invite you
hi thereyou talk a lot about lore in your op but i see no mention of roleplaying is this something that you think ccp should promote or is it a fringe playstyle that doesnt require developer attention as a tie in to that question when ccp organizes a live event do you prefer well scripted ideas that follow the lore or open ended scenarios that evolve based on player actions should player actors be involved in these eventsthanks in advance and good luck
i have three goals with lore1 the lore has had plenty of false starts in the past however right now the energy is very prolore development i feel we need a voice on the csm to continue to promote this so it doesnt end up like previous attempts we need to send a clear message to ccp that development of the science fiction narrative is very important to us as players2 i would like to see more fusion of player lore and ccp lore player events making the real news and allowing players to contribute to the unfolding lore such as the champions from the amarr succession3 increase the integration with the lore into the game so that we dont need giant lore panels to explain the monolithic amount of chronicles that already exist as far as the hacking mechanic i think it is can be viewed as a good example of what sorts of things we can do with eve interfaces however i do not feel it hit the goal of feeling like a rogue like game perhaps additional events that can come up increase challenge so winning isnt assured for high skilled players and increasing reward to compensate sov is something that i experienced but i must admit that i am not as versed as some others who are running i think that my place in that discussion is to help augment ideas and provide a critical thinking test as opposed to proposing my own solution such as i have done with the npe that being said i think cities grow up more then out and some of my ideas of what sov could be can be found in my post about pos changes which admittedly is old now
as i stated above i think the lore of eve is very rich but is still somewhat separated from the ingame experience ccp seagull has spoken about giving enablers tools in which to better create cool thingsrpers have already done amazing things without many mechanical tools in the game however a more integrated lore and a better sense that their action as rpers impact the lore as it did with the sansha events will naturally promote more rp activity in eve if members of the rp community came to me with something that would better enable them i would of course highlight those to ccp for example morwen has spoken about the need for tweaks in the ingame rp channels and systems and the new communities concept should be tooled to solve many of those problems
thread excitment intensifieswoot woot you can count on my vote
my name is bhock and i am one of the contributor of the capstable podcastin early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10here is our announcement
i think ashterothi would be good for csmx
how many live events did you take part beside the battle for caldari prime and that one in nullby player actors you mean dev actors without tham there is no live event realyevents should be scripted  in a way that the event should have at least two or more different endings that may lead to a new event related to his one and the story develops but then again it has been realy long time from last event now we get mostly few news articles
first off to double back i prefer a variety of in game events from scripted free flowing and even ccp supporting fan events an example of the third one was the first nightmare in new eden although not a lot of people showed up a ccp actor playing as a sansha invasion did it was during the events leading up to incursionsthe best lore that has come out of ccp has been when players can impact the results and even when ccp themselves dont know exactly how things will shape up only what their goals are for whatever mechanics it will tie into a really good example is the research race we just had in it the mechanical outcome was assured but the players set the details even to the extend of expanding the story beyond even what ccp expectedthe best stories are collaborative ccp seagull stated she has a long background with table top rpgs and larping and with that in mind ccp should work to set the stage and then highlight players reactions to weave a ongoing storymy dream would be to someday read the novel about the journey towards player owned stargates starting from rubicon and working its way towards the end the players impact how the story twists and turns and what exactly happens but the universe and npc actors within the story are of course part of ccps design to influence events to ensure it doesnt go off the rails as far as how many live events i have personally taken part in i have actively been present for a few of the sansha invasion events participated in the one leading towards ghost sites and criticized it for its execution and i would like to think of my work with the lore panels as participating in the current ongoing eventseditfor more information about the sansha events and live events in general
unless im mistaken ccp has previously given active roleplayers in the community control of one on the ships in a live event
while i cannot vouch for this exactly i know of a couple of examples were player actions have been augmented by ccp to provide continuation of the story

helloiUFFFDm migui xUFFFDhyrrn or how everyone else calls me migui yeah donUFFFDt try to pronounce my last name and i happen to own the character named UFFFDmiguiUFFFD iUFFFDm a 30 years old physicist from spain and i have been playing since summer 2011 with incarnai joined nullsec early on my career and starting getting involved with inalliance business organization and leadership for test alliance please ignore and as such iUFFFDm currently test head diplomat and financial directormy activities in game have been primarily economicallybased i grow a lot of isk by trading in highsec and nullsec and ended spending a good chunk of it in an avatar class ship to help my alliance with logisticsi forged my own way in eve and i have been trying since then to help my community mainly the spanish speaking people in help channels and such i own a spanish fansite 
bring battlecruisers and battleships into the game again2014 has been the year of ishtars and assorted t3UFFFDs mainly because the warp changes made it unfun to roam around in battlecruisers or larger and the medium micro jump drives never solved anythingbattleships simply die too easily to bombs so we are now stuck with a couple of valid and overused ships to fly for our doctrines that are putting us back to the days before the tiericide ishtars need to be nerfed you are a fast t2 cruiser with big resists and little risk of dying if you arenUFFFDt messing around drones can be bombed out of the field but they are very effective to the point that other doctrines have been built to specifically be antiishtar fleetssome people may argue that battlecruisers arenUFFFDt broken because one fit in particular is effective or that they are meant to be used in this way i would love to go back to 2012 where nagas were amazing to fly around you would stumble upon talos gangs tornados were all around camping gates and so on they were overpowered well maybe the other alternatives werenUFFFDt good eitherbattleships stopped being the amazing ships they were its like post 1945 era when torpedo delivering and bomb diving aircraft outdated the battleships so we either find a way to make battleships less prone to die horribly or simply nerf how good bombs are in terms of effectiveness versus risk i wonUFFFDt nerf bombs or covert ops to the ground because they are very fun ships to fly and we need them around we will find a way to use them effectively in game and being op without making the rest of the bigger ships utterly useless but i do think that for every mechanic you can take advantage of there should be a countermake eve online a more dynamic world with less botlike activitiesmining missions and marketing what do all these things have in common they can be done mindlessly in a few steps until the end of daysi am not against miners or anything i would like to make their game a bit more fun iUFFFDve found that many miners improve their game to not play the game they set up everything to alttab to netflix and such mining could become as profitable as ninjagas mining in wormholes if there was a bit of spice added to the equationbasically i would like to see bots out of eve and while this is very difficult to achieve making certain activities less based in repeating stuff over and over and over could help to fix this while you improve the overall gaming experienceeconomy overhaul for alliances from the linemember to coalition warfareone of my concerns as an alliance director is that my people are happy and have money because unhappy and poor people are less prone to fly better ships and without better ships you canUFFFDt accomplish strategic objectives because you are outgamed in no timei find that eve is way too poor in this particular aspect alliances have little margin to make money you either have moons or renters and all these resources are already taken andor depend on where you livei was there when we discussed and then signed the agreement about occupancy based sov so i pretty much agree with it i want to think like space is a living place that rewards you for taking care of it so i am going to propose to get rid of the old true security system that determines the number of spawns of anomalies and the quality of ores that you find in belts also i want to have moongoo evenly spread through nullsec and lowsec so that it is very unlikely for a group of players to control the market over certain item but also to help in local t2 production because alchemy alone cannot cope with the demands if you plan to invest heavily into thiswe can talk about lowend bottleneck and such but i think industry in 00lowsec needs to be watched carefully before jumping into conclusions dat ice compression i am aware of a number of problems related with thiseve has become a larger place since phoebe but we still depend a lot in highsec logistics because there are a number of bottlenecks that prevent us from making prosper statesby getting rid of true security i would tie the quality of anomalies to other things for example sov indexes and occupancy lets say the more you use the space the better it becomes the more people you have within a constellation the better the anomalies chances of officer spawns etc even more true security could be tied to this activity so it would fluctuate with time within certain valueswe could tie this to the lore UFFFDhey we are pirates trying to make a living here and this motherf comes to murder us like all the time lets counterattack themUFFFDthis way we would get rid of UFFFDha you live in that  region no one wants and iUFFFDm sitting here piling up iskUFFFD this could even out the things a lot for alliances that havenUFFFDt been there for years and have everything already figured outi donUFFFDt want to take anything from anyoneUFFFDs hands because iUFFFDm pretty sure everyone worked hard to get them i want to even out the things by helping those that donUFFFDt have that optionwe might be able to set up alliance level taxes for some stuff i am not a fan of milking our people but maybe a little tax could help the finances specifically if you are starting over after losing a big war or something like that continues
lowsec is life lowsec is loveoutside factional warfare and a handful of systems that happen to be active because of their location lowsec is mostly empty and it is empty because there is no reason to stay there you get better things in nullsec or you get safer things and arguably better in highseclowsec needs a purpose in eve online probably moving all lvl4UFFFDs would be way too extreme but what about creating new fun content for lowsec as a new kind of missions tied to the lore or anomalies that only exist there and that are actually worth it to runoverhaul of corporation and alliance management just some little annoying thingsroles shares kicking inactive people etc if you have experience with the corporation management tab andor alliance i feel your pain this needs a serious rework i want to be able to activate a UFFFDkick if inactive after x monthsUFFFD maybe unless that guy has some particular role to prevent deceased members or other special cases being kicked iUFFFDm sure that huge corps will like thisshares are the key either to evict your ceo or to save your corp if your ceo is in jail either way in a game where trust is that important shares are too powerfulbetter standings management i want to have the possibility to define better what 25 means and what 50 gets you and the same thing for 50 or 100 and possibly the notification of standing changes towards your corp or alliancestation management needs to improveintegration between different cultureslanguageseve online has a ton of people from all around the world as a spaniard i have found that not having a version for my fellow latin american and spaniard friends is a big wall in front of them to try out the game and play it many of them like the idea but canUFFFDt get involved because of language barriersi am perfectly aware that translating the game is a long term investment for the company and it is not a straight decision to take if numbers arenUFFFDt good based on promisesi would like to get rid of this problem by tying at least some of the character strings to a local file or maybe an overviewlike file stored in the server and then having the possibility of submitting translations this could be managed by a subversion or something like that where people proposes the translation gets voted and ends being submitted for a final previewthis way we would get quality translations for free the company would get rid of legal issues that might arise with the translation and we would bring the game to anyone around the globe that wants to join the funi would like to see the old language channels come back because we miss themsov revamp legacy code aka poses and suchif ccp seagullUFFFDs roadmap is accurate we will be getting more info about ccp plans at fanfest 2015 as i said before i signed the occupancysov proposal so there is that i do like the UFFFDel diginUFFFDs solutionUFFFD back in a few months agowell i have more ideas but this is a draft you may ask me anything you would like to know thanks for readingalso i will be doing an ama in revedreddit
bump myself up woot n stuff
ccp says a lot of things and doesnt deliver frustrating but they arent going to change
dear ccp dear csmafter reading 4 days minutes i want first to thank you all for this workthere is a lot of very accurate informations about eve but also about ccps lifesome opinions 1 what about displaying specific windows for targets  easier to watch in the same time a ship near you and a np pirate when you are mining for example2 even if its not csm purpose we understand that eve online main changes in the future depend on legion and valkyrie interactivity with eve how can we do so that eve players could make know what they would like for legion and valkyrie in a eve player spirit  i propose to open also specific sessions in summit for legion and valkyrie3 about wis nothing well i hope that some csm members are fighting so that it could keep on because its also a change much more visible than a graphic detail for example4 csm member activity he must be active with ccp thats ok but in fact we dont really see it what is important for players is how active is the csm member with players as an example even if mike is remote for summit and for very good personal reasons im sure he is very active to answer and give visibility as much as he can on game evolutions5 csm is a very good concept it must be developed ccp and csm must take in account players opinions and not only veterans opinions who sometimes forget what can be other games i am new in eve but i played video games already that your moms did not plan yet to wipe clean you the bottom for most of you eve will live ten years more if there will be again big woooo they are not in some unrelevant module changesbest regards and thanks again
no its not but thats the point it forces you to either man up and fight back turtle up and not do much unless its safe wimp out and leave the corp for the duration of the war or hire some mercs to fight on your behalf thats the whole point of wardecsto force you into action the merits of what action you take can be debated but the point is to force a reactionanywhere is the place for pvp as is being aptly demonstrated by the gankers and wardec corps high sec isnt safeit was never designed to be safeand you should definitely not think of it as suchhigh sec is also not supposed to be a themepark its just as dangerous as low or nullactually probably more dangerous since people always seem to have a false sense of security while in it nothing needs fixingas far as a majority of the playerbase and most of the devs are concerned its working as intentedread the falcon quote and htfu
what do folks think of being able to customize brackets themselves to change color to represent if they were over within or under your current weapons optimal perhaps as a right click option to the specific weapon system so you could even do it with various high and mid slot ewarright click  use as bracketoverview filter  glorious colors
one persons take on why people quit evethe commentary is pretty slow and dreary so i will give you the highlights of the complaints1 difference in skill points between veterans and newbies2 they want to get into a capital ship and wipe out whole gangs and fleets solo3 eve is a harsh game translates to ccp developers do not care about their players4 there is not enough spoon feeding of new players and leading them by the nose telling them what to do next5 eve is too slow and boring6 their favourite ship which they are emotionally attached to is lost7 fitting takes too long8 lose their battleship and all their isk1 as he says he puts most of his skills into pve personally i have so few skill points that anyone who focuses on missions and incursions will over take me in a year you do not need a lot of skill points you need a good fit for a ship that falls within that skill limitation and your budget2 welcome to the entitled immediate gratification generation need i say more or can i just ask them to try eve again when they have grown up a bit3 i feel ccp is a mixed bag of people just doing their jobs but by and large they are passionate about their work there is also a thin like that they walk one hand they can be considered too but on the other people can think they have gone too carebear and are turning eve into a theme park 4 newbie free for all for a day in a seperate sector of space  tutorial area virtual worlds to have the freedom that you do not have in real life 5 eve is not a first person space shooter it is a tactical and strategic maybe a tactical and political game there is so very much to do you just have to figure out all the stuff i have so many things to do right now regarding eve that i dont make much in the way of isk at all talk to people get involved in things this is not designed to be a solo game if you make it into a solo game of you versus and asteroid or the rats in the same missions then obviously you will become bored6 salvage the old ship if you can and build some of the next one from that continue the generations i give my ships roman numerals to see what version of one i am on7 we could do with a replicate option buy multiple fits into one giant container set one up then sourcing from there drag the fit onto other ships that are the same a bit like how blue prints work checking that you have all the bits and pieces8 similar to 2 they want to get into a bigger and what they believe is a safer ship please ccp add some tank and weapon requirements 8 days to sit in a battleship is really bad for the gameone comment that stood out every other game is based on wow except for eve i am not sure if the cracking sound was my skull or my desk how are people believing that
getting veterans out of the nest
i would recommend you not schill your campaign in the newbro sub forumyou looked worse than the socialist party farming drunken teenagers on the weekend for petition signatures on things no one in their right mind would sign dublin is a silly placeexept less funny1 vote for you madame
thishave some class
shrugs i dont expect to win a seat at this point this thread is turning into a pseudo blogedit when you attempt to lecture me and actually believe i will care at least attempt to write in a coherent fashion
original post updated and shutting down the forums for the day too much yammering and not enough playing lately
no i ment what i said as i said it and as an ardant socialist so keep your flamebait if you cant even be relied upon to address what was said to you in a straight forward answer why in the name of jamil should anyone want you near a representative position
what a bunch of crapif this makes the csm it shows how bad people are at making choicesinfinity
your story is surprisingly similar to mine i also watched my original corpmates run and hide when we got into a war i had intended to troll them with evasive mining ships we were a mining corp and ride it out but two things disappointed me1 i never saw a war target despite spending a considerable amount of time in our known home system2 the corp evaporated and i had to leave as the ceo was repurposing the skeleton for other thingsi got into wormhole space a couple of times and also used a cyclone for its versatility though i mostly went that path because i love versatile ships i made a masterpiece swiss army ship out of a myrmidon to which ossian boone a corpmate said the memorable quote which now sits in my bio that ship was lost on its maiden voyage to a ganker i didnt see coming and it got no further than partway through a class 1 combat sitei later went into nullsec but i got with a suballiance of it alliance right before the catastrophic topple and then gentlemens agreement afterward and finally in test i found out about providence during my time in test after i had joined dromedaworks and after i was already giving up on trying to unite highsec players into a fighting force to combat highsec piracy i dream that in another life i could have been very happy in providence but im also happy in testand the two seem diametrically opposed to each othermore recently i am postulating getting involved in some code activities i like their stance on punishing afk gameplay and teaching newer players how to fit and fly defensively id be more lenient perhaps focusing on the teaching and doing less of the mafiastyle extortion but itll perhaps provide me with some networking to help me find people to gank with me when i go ouot to shoot bot minerswhich gets me to my last pointi have also ganked my first blood happened when i was jetcan mining in a retriever and a guy came by in an iteron mk 3 and stole my ore i did what i normally do continue as if nothing happened he came back for more so i went to station and fit a warp scrambler sure enough he comes for a third helping he didnt get away with it i later was mining in tekaima i dont only mine but it fuels my need to gank it seems and was really fed up with all the bot miners moving in and constantly clearing out the ore couldnt talk to them there was nobody present so i got with a guy who was willing to gank with me we went up against hulks each in a catalyst i first selected targets carefully and gave them several minutes to respond and then when i was convinced they were bot miners i got him over to help gankgood fun i am interested to see that you and i have a rather similar history though it divides suddenly when we enter nullsec youre one of the good guys now and im one of the bad guys 
this is something i would like to see there are some subjects in eve that are probably best not introduced early on but having additional career agents that are accessible after a player has been in the game for awhile would be excellentfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
my assumption is anyone who doesnt just stay in the starting system and do constant missions will die horribly in a few days the question is how do we get new players used to dying horriblyperhaps one of the tutorial objectives should be wander off and get killed by another player
there is a mission in advanced combat that makes you lose your ship but it could be improved upon it lacks that oomph of a real death when its at the hands of npcs although it was kind of interesting when i did the mission i got my cruiser instead of using the intended ship and tried to brute force my way through it thinking i would beat the odds i lost the cruiser and later decided if i could do it again i might have been able to complete it if i had fit smartbombs
1 what are the 3 most important lessons about eve newbros should be taught within their first 3 days of playing2 do you want to change the location of the starting systems if so where would you put them instead closer to lowsec  nullsec cordoned off in an isolated space3 should mining ships and industrials have more offensive power
ooh i like these questions 1 about eve basic mechanics communications with other players more of the choices than just mine or mission2 i can see an argument for putting them on the perimeter of high sec to give them the option temptation but i dont think i would actively push for a map shift at this point3 i loved battle badgers and the idea of an offensive miner appeals to me but only if the offence comes at the cost of mining efficiency remember the mining rohkmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
for the lessons i meant something more philosophical like dont fly what you cant afford to lose expect to die a lot and better to have many cheap ships than one expensive shipas for the mining i dont remember the mining rokh i think mining barges are in a good place offensewise with the procurer being a tough nut to crack its the industrial haulers im concerned about as the t1s can often be blown up by a single t1 frigate this can be a problem in nullsecit feels like the intention was for industrials to have escorts but in practice 90 of them travel by themselves and have to avoid every fight perhaps a more expensive faction version of the haulers that could hold its own against 12 frigates my main concern is whether thats dissuade newbros from attacking haulers more often but it might also encourage them to group up and socialize to take them downalthough that brings up another question do you think increased difficulty encourages players to group together does it need a little nudge to get players grouping or do you think players group up for other reasons entirely
ever tried dagan at the end of the sisters arcyeah i think that we need more of that sort of mission that drives people to cooperate it could be made optional so the people who really want to fly alone could there is a fine line between encouraging and forcing and i want to see us stay on the right side of that line mmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
right now one could argue a fair chunk of the pve risk in groups is other players for obvious reasons would you advocate group pve content that protected the group from pvp disruption but have very low rewards to allow groups to practice mechanics and learn the gamefollow up with the change in corp ff mode would you advocate a holo room which is effectively sisi on tranq where players can fight each other in a simulation for training and tournaments
ive always felt that designing pve to act such that a good group of two partnering together is much more than twice as strong as each individually so that their combined efforts multiply rather than divide do you see such things as encouraging like for instance if a mission pitted you against a bunch of frigates and cruisers all at once but if you go in with a frigate and a cruiser each npc will go after the target of their size allowing you to split up the incoming fire as well as having npcs go toward the player that can better fight them is that like what you mean
actually no i didnt i bolted for nullsec after completing half the tutorials because they were taking too long and covering stuff i felt i could figure out on my own and i avoided doing the sisters arc after that because i heard there were plenty of griefers that camped the sites on that mission arc to kill newbros
much of the sov stuff is nda  i ll ha ve a piece up on eve24 soon but its pending nda check with ccp currently i think also for reference few pists up sion also csm told in this thread how we connected on which i agree very much as its mutual
another idea could be to give them fullyfitted ships as rewards for the npe but have 12 modules they need to train into to use that way they have some direction in planning their skills and get to see what a decentlyfitted ship looks like
jaynethe news at 11 shows that your main director who essentially ran the corp has left for greener pastures koz katral  pl what impact will this have on your csm run will you continue the neglect you have shown to sash
sigh reallykoz left the corp on good terms its no secret that npsi fleets are often made up of pilots who have lower skill points and experience than groups like pl and koz simply wanted to fly more advanced doctrines with higher skilled pilotsit will have no effect on my run for the csm
i think the suggestion that i essentially ran the corp is an over statement to say the least jayne has always been at the forefront of anything sash has done i left the corp on good terms and i wish them all the best in the future i think vouches from close friends and corp members are relatively cheesy and predictable  but for what its worth i think jaynes passion for and understanding of the game along with his great communication skills would make him a fantastic csm representative  not just for people who engage in npsi pvp but for anyone who uses this game as a social platform
this is eve people scam and cheat others because they can well i think that all the gameplay at work in eve should be represented even if he would had cheated me out of something because of x y z reasons if he was good at it well good for him but in any case trust for someone to work for the game is different than trusting a guy for a corp or other stuff that is realted to you ingame if it wasnt clear the way i was saying it just pm me
the criticism raised has nothing to do with cheating or scamming but actual quality of ideas presented and ability to follow through
i dont hold it against you that you may have scammedstole this is a viable gameplay tactic and part of eve we have goons that have a whole culture that celebrates this sort of thing as they should and so your participation in such activities only shows that you play the game how you want i flew with spectre fleet a long time ago and i had a lot of fun sniping provibloc fleets with longbows railcorms i think you should be judged fit for csm based on the level of maturity and your ability to deal with criticism regardless of how you play the game this quality is the corner stone of anyone being a leader of any community and im sure that you agree that out of game maturity is far more important than what you play as in game
thanks for all the great support

brigadir black emailed me a question about how i would improve pi my answer is a bit short i may expand on that more soonfrom brigadir blacksent 20150129 1937to ashterothihow would you make the interface better if you can somehow get a live pi app i would literally love you foreverpi app is the dream and something i would push forin the mean time the following changes would go a long way1 drag and drop connections between things drag and drop elements into the map drag and drop items to locations to create routs lock to grid and lock to adjacency2 factories build on input smartly and better feedback if the inputs are not configured correctly3 copy paste function so you can save setups and just plop them down wherever wanted like templates
good luck ashterothi you make a good csm
offline pos tower mechanics need to be fixedhighsec needs more burner missions fun and good isk for pilotsmany reasonable improvementschanges that i would advocate for if elected csm to ccp

my name is bhock and i am one of the contributor of the capstable podcastin early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10here is our announcement
his blog was one of the first that dragged me into eve you have my respect as a player and one of my votes
i like
cant say enough about how much thought migui puts into decisions before making them from inttraalliance drama to disagreements with coalition mates migui is often there listening to everything and giving it all equal weight before arriving at a decision and i have never seen him come to a conclusion soley based or even influenced by someones corp or alliance ticker he gets all my votes

not voting for you solely because of your view on mining miners have the game they want a way to progress or socialize with buddies in eve while at work or otherwise preoccupied with life on a second screen changing mining to be more active based would just force miners to sit there and stare at the rocks for hours on end rather than engage with friends or paperworkin other words you hate miners and want them to be slaves to minigames no thank you not supported never ever nope
not trying to be a  but you realize that you can both mine and socialize with buddies at the same time right i used to be a highsec miner and i did it and it wasnt difficult at all if youre mad because this may make it harder for you to play a game while youre at work all i can say is i want your job
i dont hate miners i was one myself and i have many miner friends that i respect eve is a sandbox there are not ways of playing it more legit than others we can argue about certain aspects on how to optimize particular ways of playing to maximize the benefits for example dont want them out murdered or anything but i think that mining makes new people stuck themselves and missing a huge part of the game which is sad i think that eve is a living thing and i want that you have to be there to max the benefits whats the point in having 20 accounts to play the game without playing the game socialize im a diplomat politics is what i do docked or using external programs do you want to mine while you are not there for hours just because it is a very poor way of making iskid rather improve the benefits per hour while making it less likely to be the paradise of betting i havent said anything about mini games though eve needs to start making sure that risk vs benefit becomes true
its not just at work its i dont want to be trying to find time to type in chat while having to play some absurd minigame every last one of these improve mining ideas turn into
basically everything that can be trivially escalated horizontally has to be reworked banning broadcasting in isboxer was the best thing ever do you want to mine afk ok so be it but if you mine and pay attention you should get rewarded accordingly
so ask yourself how do you see making mining actually fun with any mechanic considering they will be doing the exact same thing say 5001000 times a day if they are activethis would drive out more miners than it would attract mining afk or not and im not saying i want to mine afk just be able to focus on chatting in the chat boxes instead of being forced to play the same interaction over and over and over again on screen its the primary reason why i and most miners mine instead of mission
most newbie miners according to my experience in multiple helping channels and so on mine because they know nothing else and they think that mining is a good way to make isk it actually isnt i dont want to get rid of miners again i want that newbros arent stuck in mining since their first day because the game pushes you to do that mine if you like that stay docked if you like that its up to you your game your choice things that scalate horizontally that easily are the heaven for botters and we must get rid of bottersi think that risk vs reward and staying at the keyboard are important things for a online game you are not part of the scenery you are a player alive and you should be there playing the game also this doesnt mean that you should be forced to pay 150 of attention to mine like every second so you dont have even a second to type in chat between black and white there are many scales of grey
i find it rather odd you admit you dont find an activity fun yet you continuously do said activity and vehemently oppose any proposed changes to it youre admitting you want to play eve by not playing the game and doing something else please think about that for a couple of minutes
hello my name is dominik and i am 25 years old i have played eve for a few years now and in the past year i started to work on some personal projects in eve one such project was my corporation stille gewalt which coincided with another project which is an npsi community under the same namemy primary focus in eve is low sec pvp where i engage in all flavors of pvp from small to large scale fleets which i achieve through interacting with the eve community through my npsi groupmy npsi group has become quite popular amongst the german playerbase and the greater eve community you may have joined one of our fleets or attended one of our events such as our carrier events when im not doing community work i am a low sec pirate fc corp ceo and alliance director for one of the largest alliances in minmatar spacewhether i am flying the banner of my npsi community or alliance i am dedicated to finding good content if elected i would strive to provide ccp the necessary feedback and suggestions to help guide the game into a contentrich environment for all types of players and playstylesi believe with my experience with interacting with the many different players and playstyles in eve that i would be a prime candidate for csm xthanks for readingcitricioni
respect for throwing your hat in the ring but csm work means lobbying on behalf of the players so what are the 3 most important things changes additions to the game you will fight for if elected
thanks for your question1 creating a simple environment for newer players to discover which area is the right thing for them currently it is still difficult without the help of the community to get in i see it many times that newer players stop playing before they can see the beautiful side of that game maybe something like a more ingamebased platform for community work like the help channel but with menus and some features it would be helpful for everyone who want to help people announce things come together and maybe some new players easier find the great things in that game at the moment we have the chat channels the forum every ingame community got their own forum too and 3rd party tools like fleetup and coall that as ingamecontent would be great2 creating a more diverse environment for the care bears and minersmarter more varied and sometimes stronger npcs  more entertainment for minersi know most of the mission runners maybe like or dont have a problem that they run the same mission 123456 times but im sure it will be greater if it is more random how a mission is and not everytime the same x missions3 t2 capitals everyone wants to see them t3 battleships more and more shipsa flood of new shipseven though i know that it is not easy for balancing reasons to get more ships fastbut more ships  more variations  more funi know there are some mistakes but you know im not a native speaker regardscitricioni
wardecs principelly seem to be a good idea to bring alliances and corporations in highsec in conflict but most of the time wardecs are restricted to tradehub camping it shouldnt be possible to declare war on more then hundred corporationsalliances without any drawbacks wardec should be an expensive way to counter your competition wardec should more an active campaign where both sides should forced to interact with each other i have no special idea how to realize this but i want to discuss how this can be made ganking should be more than camping and bumping i have no problem if ganking is an act of capabilities but there should always a way to counter especially the freighter bumping with machariels and so on shouldnt be that easy i heard much about it and made my own experiences there is no way to counter if you get bumped for an hour or longer besides logoff webbing is no solution if the bumper is faster than you on your freighter the most other mechanisms are fine maybe the risk vs reward should be corrected a bit since destroyers not that expencive think its a bit of both sites there should be more competition between corporations and i would like to see corporation tasks especially in missions some corporations members never interact with an other besides some ts chatter there could be more i thought industrial teams would the answer if that teams are corporate members or maybe members from other corporations but not npcs maybe there is a way to implement this that way

here is an idea that could even expand industry blueprints for expansions or modifications to captains quarters why because it would be a sink for minerals and an isk sink not to mention more things that could be input into the economy to give it a more realistic feel why not make trade goods actually good for something other than just sitting around in a hangar make them consumable by blueprints for expanding cq creating decorum et cetera everyone whines about problems but provides no suggestions and that is only you being part of the problem offering suggestions or solutions becomes you being part of the solution as a whole we have a massive community that proposes a great and many things that could be useful create more immersion new careers think interior decorator for those who would find interest in that the more we add to the game in a constructive fashion the longer it will last the greater legacy and impact it will have as wellleave things better than you found them so keep ideas and communications on things flowing sure youll get trolls and naysayers but eventually someones idea gets picked up and becomes a part of evei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
am i hearing a designable captains quarter where i can have poles with exotic dancers spinning around on them and even a janitor just as annoying as the guy in the old tomb raiders who followed you around i think if they brought this in id struggle finding a reason to undock
pretty shocked to hear a goon advocate for space barbies just goes to show
really gonna need you to finish that thought so i know what youre talking about
regarding day 3 and merchandise i had this thought that i posted on redditreally disappointed on the general lack of information regarding merchandise it really annoys me ccp refuses to capitalize on the eve brand and make merchandise many of us are begging for i want a tea mug a pen stickers lanyard badge holders cups air freshener for car etc many companies do this they farm it out to a 3rd party and give them the license to make swag with their logo on it even smaller companies do they so they have stuff to give awaysellgot a ccp response now happypost is here
i would like to advise you of a situation of which youve probably already heard  but which is causing a growing disquiet amongst players  sometimes causing them to deactivate their accountsthe problem is thisi like quite a few other players  do not wish to engage in pvp at all  you will find i am mostly a pve player having run thousands of missions at level 4however  as a subscriber to the game  my experience is being ruined by gate campers in low sec systems whose ships are fitted for pvp where mission runners fit for pve they are camping the gates and locking down upon entry to the low sec system meaning three things1 loss of the ship and mods2 declining of the mission  losing standing points3 disinterest in the game  with a reluctance to want to playit is highly unfair that pve capsuleers have to deal with pvp players our ships are fitted completely differently and often its not even 1 on 1  its like 1520 on one leaving you absolutely no chance at all if i wasnt subscribing  i wouldnt care less but i am  i pay for it  and feel that the satisfaction i receive from game play now falls very short of the mark why should i consider paying you when i cant play the game i want to playi have spoken in rl to at least 1200 players in the uk who all feel the same way 1 friend of mine who plays eve has recently deactivated all 6 of his accounts because of this issue this at the end of the day is lost revenue toccp his situation alone has cost ccp UFFFD72000 in one year multiply that by other multiple account players all doing the same and it isnt going to take long before your revenue comes into some noticeable declineplease please please accept the following suggestion1 once a pve player accepts a mission in low sec from his agent  grant the mission runner some immunity from pvp players this means that upon entry to the low sec system  the mission runner will show as a different colour to the rest of the players and cannot be locked or scrambled in turn  the mission runner cannot lock or scramble a player either only an npc2 lock down the mission gates so that only the player that accepted his mission can use them in order to prevent pvp players from scanning for and entering the mission theatre and destroying you there3 lock down all other stargates in the mission system other than the route there and home whilst the mission is in acceptance this means that there can be no abuse by the player who accepts the mission once the mission is accepted  it has to be done and you cant jump to other systems to ferry cargo for example  which i know some players may wish to exploit4 the immunity period lasts only as long as the mission bonus deadline if the deadline passes  the mission runner is no longer immune to pvp players targeting this will also mean that then the player has a choice  i do the mission straight away or ii if the bonus deadline passes  he can risk it or decline  thats fair5 another alternative would be to give players the option of working for agents at level 4 or level 5 that only provide missions in high sec and do not send into low sec space even at the expense of lower lps and isk rewardsi urge you to listen to this  because probably unknown to you  it really is becoming a problem ingamei really love playing eve  and i know many other players who love playing it too so please be fair we are paying you dont forget it is therefore fair that the players who subscribe have at least a chance to play the game that they wish to play without the aggro of more aggressive players ruining their game playin reference to the above  i dont even attempt level 5 missions anymore i really want to do them too  but just simply cant  because as soon as you accept  your mission theatre is invaded by pvp players who lock you down and destroy your ship as if a mission 5 solo isnt hard enough anywayplease can you let me know your thoughts
my thoughts are as followsnohell nogo back to wow
if troll 010if not every single one of your ideas runs afoul of the core tenets of eve such as but are not limited to no instancing ever everyone is allowed to affect each other for better or worse industry affects pve which affects pvp which can affect industry and pve back  everything you do in eve requires that you be in competition with someone else meaning you are always pvping in a sense either directly or indirectly important one all styles of play are supposed to come into conflict with one another whether they like it or not industrialists and pveers must learn some basic pvp pvpers must learn basic industry and pve neither side can get away with being pureif you still think that you are entitled to being left alone then i do not think eve is the game you want and i rarely say that to anyone notetaken from this thread
posting a lengthy response would feel a little redundant now so ill just saywrong game play another its quite possible to avoid combat in this game  but avoiding the interference of others in your activities is just another form of pvp  which you dont want to engage in
not sure if serious
fixed it for you

see op the thing about high security space is that it has high security conversely the thing about low security space is that it has low security if you want a high level of security then perhaps you should stay in high security space this is not a difficult concepti dont think you are trolling i think you are still grieving over your tengu and yet this is a somewhat excessive response to a single ship loss in the last five years

ahoy steveyou are a hero of the new eden peoples and we thank you for your efforts thus far on the csm here is what i would like to ask about in regards to the next termin your capstable interview you were questioned briefly about npsi groups and their access to ingame communication tools i thought the answer given to this was good but can you comment on how external third party development could benefit these communities if you agree that currently there is room for it to do sooverall what has been your biggest disappointment on ccps end whilst serving on the csm this last year also what is your stance on the present state of boosters in the game both in respect to their actual usage as well as creation is this an area that could benefit from an overhaullastly you find yourself in an ice cream parlour on a hot summers day sadly there are only two flavours of icecream left over chocolate  tutti frutti which flavour do you choosethanks twitter  wwwtricksofthetradesnet
in turnnpsi external tools can certainly help organise the npsi community fleetup for example does wonders for sharing fits and its use of sso makes the speed bump of registration minimal one of the biggest problems that i see i may be a touch blinkered is discoverability the communities exist but getting them into the hands of new players is more difficult ideally a search function would be possible both in and out of game which can make finding them easier and then also the basic management tools online so you can accept members kick them send messages to them and so on from outside the client which means that you can spend your online in client time on whats really important shooting people in the face being able to automate bits of it would also be handydisappointmentsthis is a difficult one to answer id have liked to see more happen with crest but i can understand why it didnt have to be careful with access to tq ditto with alliance logos bah lawyers  while there were some communications problems and some things going out to the community before wed had much of a chance to review them again i can understand why it happenedand while you didnt ask my biggest disappointment with myself is the initial freighter rework with rigs i should have caught that i just ran the stats and completely forgot about how expensive the rigs actually areboostersive not done much with boosters but i dont think theyre in a particularly good place right now they deserve an overhaul both for use and for creation ditto with reactions those are painful to setup something id really like to see is more use of synth possibly as part of the npe just to introduce players to them rather than depending on other players to learn about them possibly have some agents give it out too in limited numbers just to give people their first taste oh and have them able to be contracted just mark courier contracts as containing illegal goodsi would probably go with chocolate tutti frutti has so many variations
you have my votespraise the yeti
thank you kindly
what did you do to hockles
i dont know maybe you should stick to posting on infowars
want more evil in eve vote bushido 
 no kind of minigame please any addition of this sort will get incredibly repetitive and dull extremely quickly if the objective is to stop miners mining then yes i think a minigame is a great idea but if its to fix the inherent boredom involved in mining then no
noted i am open for anything to keep the miners happy enough to dont go afk
time to bring the evil back in eve 
go go go el numero unocan i vote with 2 hands dgame for miners option
what do you recommend happens to someone who has not found a corp in that period of time
good question probably something evil like 100 tax 
this might be an odd way of answering your question but tonight on the eve down under show i had a great deal to say about my opinion of the npe tomorrow once i get the audio of the show in my hands ill post a link to a soundcloud of it which should address your questiondt is a big issue for a lot of autz players since it falls during our primetime something many us and eu tz players wouldnt appreciate the impact of eliminating downtime entirely is probably a pipe dream without some very intensive changes to the core systems of eve to that end i dont think its something we can realistically expecthowever during edu2013 ccp fozzie took a straw poll of people in attendance and in a postedu survey i also canvassed the community for their preferences the general consensus seems to be that moving downtime earlier by 3 hours to 0800 utc might be the best outcome for the autz without impacting too much on us and euthe result would be thus local time west coast us would now have dt at midnight east coast us would now have dt at 3am west eu would have dt at 9am rus most of them would now have dt at 11am and autz would have dt at 7pm est  meaning that by the time they sat down at the pc after dinner and putting the kids to bed theyd have the entire evening  uninterrupted  to play internet spaceships with their matesan 0800 utc dt shouldnt be too terrible for ccps server teams eitheri wont make some foolhardy statement like promising to get dt moved if im on the csm but its something that ccp have inquired about independently which suggests to me theyve given it some thought already and as an autz player myself im acutely aware of the inconvenience the current timing of dt causes i have my preference for when it should be as outlined above and if there is any opportunity to advance that change to ccp you bet im going to push it not factoring in spouse aggroeve down under  a community for players in the autz
what do you think about ccps initiative to just remove dt entirely
this sounds like a great solution
c1 to c4 are in a better place now than they used to be although c1 and c2 could maybe use a bit of a buff stillon c5 and c6 cap escalations it gets a bit trickier if its 5 people min maxing then its probably to high although you are limited on how many sites you have to run a day the issue comes in when you have 10 plus people running them and then the isk isnt all that great ish per hour might still be good but you will only run sites for 1 hour the main problem is there is no incentive to run sites with more people id love if there was some way they scaled to incentive people to do them in bigger groups a bit like incursions
id argue that damn near all of the danger in pve comes from other players but i would not argue for too much more protection because that ill prepares them for the big beyond see that is where the concept of balance comes in i object to guys greening their killboard by blapping people less than three weeks old but then i also object to giving protection to people making stupid mistakes like rushing into a ship they are not ready for only to lose it to the aforementioned l33t pvp3rs so darwinism is maybe the answer but with a little help i wan tfocus on keeping new players but not at the cost of losing the basic essence of the game which i presume was what brought them here in the first place nothat is what sisi is i have said before that i like them to have some skin in the game and so losses on tq should be realmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
dont know about any of the above but id be willing to give you a nice shiny new isk if you get that far 
why such a big bounty on your head 
the current csm has achieved nothing other than further entrenching broken and unbalanced gameplay thanks to it being an echo chamber of uninformed opinions so why should anyone vote you in again
from friends and listeners tot eh podcasts i do i consider the addition to it to be a show of support and sent thank you notes to the people to add to it i may miss one or two but most have been thanked feel free to add to it as wellmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
an echo chamber of uninformed opinions i disagree heartily but then being uninformed i suppose i would which broken and unbalanced game play do you refer to and how have you evaluated it to be a failurei know what the metrics are i know what actions have been taken and what is proposed for the future i am the only person with two seasons of csm under my belt and willing to run again i am not uninformed old son not at all nor are many of my fellow council members but you are welcome to believe what you will of us obviously we did not hand you the style of gameplay you wanted or properly nerfed somebody elses so you are angry i get thatachieved nothing by what measure would you judge us how could we show you that we have achieved nothing and not totally break the nda what would you expect of a csm if you could set the standardsthis is not just for mr grumblypants here part of the election is choosing what and who you want i have set myself out as a conduit and a communicator as a casual gamer and a highsec fan other candidates have set themselves out in other ways to distinguish themselves from the packthere are interviews and campaign threads and articles and vote match    all ways to choose the people who will best represent you and be your csmif you dont like any of them run yourself now is the time to get that application in up until feb 15thmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
well but you are also like this a nice prey for a lot of unscrupulous piratesi prefer to express my friendship in another way than making you a target
it is easy for a incumbent to laud their successes and hide failurescan you give an example where you supported a side on a decision that ended up not being what ccp went for and that it turned out work out anywaysin other words was there a topic this last year where you fell on the wrong side of history
why would any sane person waste their time campaigning to be part of a group of players that a has very little impact on anything b between them manage to have less game knowledge than ccp rise and c have to go to iceland when ccp feels like they need a pr boosti could go through the last set of minutes that were posted to point out specific failings but honestly id rather play eve than waste time looking through that trainwreck
top twoi would still like to see some counter mechanic for cloaking i fought on multiple fronts for more dynamic pve content incursions variance pirate raids more missions smarter ai and i dont feel i had as much success as i wantedbiggest frustration being remote makes communication and order of magnitude more difficult there were things i wanted said during various sessions of the winter summit but could not get a word in edgewise or did so via text and was thus not in the minutesdamn that was a good question ash you ought to have a podcast and interview folksmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i should maybe i could call it hyper mobile nah how about low speedeh ill work on it and get back to you
i have a question for you you stated that the concord lp you felt was watered down by incursions but in a replied on page one you stated you would like to see incursions be more lp and little liquid isk how do you plan on doing both do you have any figures you had in mindoh look the cat is sitting in the litter box and pooping over the side again every time we go through these rough patches in good humor and slight annoyance boiglio
whats your favourite anime
if youre elected into the csm does that mean digi will start leaking internal discussions and profiles on ccp staff
anime is cartoons
yes
works for me
ive been on hiatus for a bit but as soon as i heard jayne was running for csm i wanted to log in and show my supportjayne is one of the most intelligent and considerate people that ive had the good fortune of flying with whether its educating new pilots on the ins and outs of combat or collaborating with existing csm members or ccp devs you simply couldnt ask for a better representative for the eve communitybest of luck to you jayne i know youll do a spectacular job
you have my vote manny good luck
i love you chance bats eyelashes your videos make me want to leave high sec and go exploring of course i havent because incompetence but you know i still want toyou have my vote
when you consider 98 of eve players are probably equally or even less competent myself included youll see it doesnt matter live your dreams or failing that destroy the dreams of others
was interested in being a stealthy kind of guy ingame ever since i started playing a little over a month ago mentioned it to a friend and he linked me to your stealthbomber videos since then ive watched every single one of your stealthbomber videos trained up for exploration and gotten my self an astero fitted out and now im training up to use a manticore seriously chance youre an inspiration to me youve definitely got my vote
ahoylistened to your capstable interview recently and was really impressed i think you have a lot to offer and are a slightly underrated candidate which could play to your advantage i hope you get elected and you are on my ballot so to speak heres what im curious about in terms of questionswhat are your thoughts on the concept of the social groupscorp lite idea thats come into beingwould you like to say anything about these components jayne listed in this post that are relevant to the aforementioned corp lite idea which ones are goodbad if any and would you add anything further to them that you thinks been missedwe both seem to agree boosters and implants have much room for improvement and are somewhat neglected for improvement by ccp can you elaborate or expand upon how these could be improved maybe in your own eyes lastly you find yourself in an ice cream parlour on a hot summers day sadly there are only two flavours of icecream left over chocolate  tutti frutti which flavour do you choosethankstwitter  wwwtricksofthetradesnet
friends capsuleers and citizens of new edeni come before you today to speak of a scourge that is plaguing the heart of this community one that cannot be underestimated overlooked or outright ignored it comes without warning devouring prominent members of the eve media leaving a lack of content in its wakei speak of course of the nda sleepersit would seem that our friend ashterothi has fallen victim to this slow creeping miasma that stretches its tentacles across the meta game the monster comes with promises of attaining grandiose stature vacations to far away lands and a free account its gentle chorus leading to certain destruction like that of a sirens call wrecking ships upon its jagged rocky edgesno member of the community is safe if we dont fight the monster our friend ashterothi will succomb  leaving his ability to tinfoil about lore related events frozen it will create a gaping chasm of content that cannot be refilledwe must fight for our lore we must battle to save our keepers of lore safe from the confines of the nda together we can say nay mr nda you cannot take our ashterothi and silence him we say nayfight the scourge save ash from himselfokay thats out of my systemash youre a big part of us in the meta im both excited and torn on you taking this step but if this is where your heart is leading you im behind you one hundred percentgood luck1 eve community blogger  the eve editorial 
3just in case people share this concern allow me to address thata several public figures among the eve playerbase have done this kind of things before and nda doesnt mean i cant riff my own ideas off the cuff which is about 90 of my content anyways b as csm it would effectively be my job to dig in even deeper to eve onlines mechanics and rules which will only improve my ability to service in my showsc ccp doesnt share lore secrets with the player base so that shouldnt be a problemd thats why i have cohosts

heres a practical demonstration of why having someone on the csm whose primary job is teaching newbies is valuableusing more than one will be penalized needs to be replaced with using more than one has diminishing returns will be penalized is vague and makes it sound like fitting two makes your ship worse than fitting one small little points of friction add up to make the learning curve unbearably badin other news csm candidate application is now done modulo me scanning my id at work  edit done

migui is an excellent player who understands and respects the different roles in the game the gaming community will be well represented eve online if is elected
im saying i want an option in eve for me to do to have minimal progression on days i otherwis wouldnt be able to play say im told theres a major shipment coming through the airport and im stuck on an extra 6 hour shift there goes my eve time entirely for the day as i sit around an office typing up papers but with mining i can at least make a little isk while chatting with friends and doing business work so i can afford a couple frigs for a weekend roam when im not at workmost of the people who mine do it because they play during scenarios like this eve is supposed to offer a chocie for all play styles mining is for the minimal interaction minimal profit playstyle people who want to be logged in undocked at risk but not required to pay 100 attention to the game just to proceed
and im not against that like i already explained but i think that people paying attention should get more
1 excellent guy with excellent ideas
1you get my vote
recently we spoke about some of the more upsetting conspiracy theories in eve online i asked you if you in all honesty put any validity in the claim that i secretlymagicaletc went to iceland to vandalize my own name on the eve monument you told me that you did believe this while i found this unsettling its your right to believe what you want my questions are based on the subject of belief and how this affects your function as a delegate as a candidate for csm 10 how would you go about reconciling the beliefs you have in a context where they conflict with ccpas a csm delegate would you be willing to concede certain stances if those stances were seen by others to be a distraction
oh trust me me and ccp are not on the same page on a bunch of topics especially ship balancing and i have no problem calling them out or getting called out on that i try my best to argue my point and they do the same we are probably never going to 100 agree on a topic and i am not going to lay down dead just because we dont agree i dont really have any stances that are seen as a distraction because i actually play this game enough to know whats  and whats notas for the first part lol the world is out to get you
t h e r a b o i s support this product andor service
i think the biggest issue getting players through the npe is that crucial first 30 mins to an hour people need to be grabbed in that timeframe except we all know that eve isnt a game thats easily played in 30 min  1 hour bursts let alone that very first 60 minutes theres one key way they could get round this and i cant discuss it in too much detail as it is ndaed but i certainly hope ccp follow through on iti didnt spot marcs post but wrt csm members identities being private or not i really dont have a particularly strong opinion either way if someone in eve really wants to go after you they can probably find your real name pretty easily  gamergate only proves this thesis imho on the other hand there are some great potential csmers out there who havent stood up to now because they didnt want their names public i guess we shouldnt be making it easier for them ofc but i certainly have zero issues with my name being public then ccp changing the rules down the line
i didnt know xander last year but included him on my csm9 voting slate because i liked what i read and heard from him this year ive gotten to know him much better through his excellent and regular csm posts and as a result of my having joined crossing zebras as a staff writerill tell you this he cares about this game he is well spoken knowledgeable passionate and engaged he has been an actively contributing and communicating csm9 member he will be in the top tier of my csmx slate and he deserves your vote too good luck xander i hope you have the chance to continue the work you did on csm9disclaimer no i wasnt paid to say this
meine stimme haste 
not willing to discuss his ideas answers on the german forum so far were immature and just stupid  sorry but just nomoar capitals  mimimi  if you dont like that i have nothing to say dont vote for mewhen i pointed out that he could at least try to answer questions his only response was german troll for csm x
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzedit my answer to any further question i want to be famous
make off grid boosting stop and youre my man
i love the off grid warfare links so maybe there is a little problembut maybe some changes would be great a weapon timer for the ship with the links when the links are activated when someone in a boosted position in the fleet get a weapon timer easier to catch them on gatesstations warp inhibiton as long the links are active but then a reduced duration and cap need or a new skill to reduce the duration and the cap need of the modules
to show what new ships i want for the battleships i think about something like thatstrategic battleship dreadnought baby  carrier coordination module with offense  defense mode duration of the coordination module similar to the bastion with one minute while the module is inactive are the pros  cons of modes not present prior to that you can switch between defense and offense by a script advantage through a module for both you can change your fitting with the refiting use of a depot nestor and got a other ship with a other function but it is still very good at that what it do jump range as the black ops but not on covert cyno the slot layout more like the marauder and not like the black opsthe offense mode higher damage significantly above tier 3 bc tech 1 bs  marauder but still less than the dreadnought increased range open for support from other players slightly lower resistancethe defense mode no support from other players increased own tank capacity higher resistance and increased repair amount on armor repairer  shield booster reduced dps lower range bonus on remote repairer the remote repair amount should be between logistics and the remote repair of the carrier without triage self tank above the marauder but lower than the carrier without triage more like the marauderthe defense mode is the risky part because you need to make sure that this ship dont get a ubertank for small scale fleetsfor pve suitable eg incursions  wormholes

marolonaas you know the nda is extremely important for the csm to do its work and there have been past csms darius iii specifically who did not take the nda seriously and leaked a number of csm skype logs one can only assume this has reduced the willingness of ccp to work with the csmgiven your history of leaking logs from past jobs youve worked at like the themittanicom logs that you dumped on failheap without any personal information removed and with absolutely nothing interesting in them how would you respond to voter concerns that you too might leak logs from the csm like darius iiithanks
adding to evilweaselfinances question regarding leaking information which included peoples out of game details such as their real names etc the distince irony in which you marlona asserted that the reason for ccps supposed hesitance in keeping the csm in the loop was because it has become very apparent to them and even the player base  there is some loose lips on the csmyou have a history of leaking private logs as illustrated here and a distinct unwilligness to accept responsibility for not removing individuals personal information real names emails etc from those logs when confronted im curious how do you feel your membership on csm 10 would improve the image that the csm does not have loose lips to ccp

marlona sent me this response which id like to respond to publiclymy response to this is the belowmy question was quite respectfully phrased and you had every chance to challenge the facts i think it says enough that your defense is to get the post erased there are legitimate arguments you could make about why theyre different of course but if it was a grr marlona campaign then some pl guy ive never spoken to probably wouldnt have agreed with me ive looked at the evidence myself and i dont agree with your defenses number 1 leaking peoples personal information was reckless and you should have known better it probably was a mistake because you didnt really think through what would happen but it is compounded by your refusal to admit that it was wrong and actually lying about if it happened number 2 its not covered by an nda but it is a violation of social trust that people put in you that speaks to your characterthat you leaked the logs is uncontested you deny that personal information was in the logs but thats been convincingly disproven over and over again and at this point in time its your word against the logs themselves if you were correct it would be easy to prove i was wrong  and thats something youd welcome if you were correct after all the logs and scrapheap are relatively objective sourcesyou think the situations are different and that there are extenuating circumstances or other relevant facts but thats not telling me that my question is not based on truth thats telling me you disagree with my interpretation of the uncontested facts if theres other facts that are relevant the appropriate response would be to share those as well trying to get the questions erased and avoid any public discussion of the issue is not
1i have read a lot of your observationsopinions on various outlets marlona and agree with most of what you say for that reason you will be at the top of my list with manny in fact you both seem to have similar views on how the game should work which

here ill post it in a different waymarlona you asserted that the reason for ccps supposed hesitance in keeping the csm in the loop as cited by sion kumitomo in the csm 9 year in review dev blog was because it has become very apparent to them and even the player base  there is some loose lips on the csm should you get elected what do you feel would make your involvement with csm 10 any different given your past behaviorregarding the statement that no personal information was leaked in those logs lucia denniard who you had host the logs can attest that personal information was in the original logs you provided she was requested to remove any references to peoples real world names and had to run a script to remove that information this can be proven when comparing the logs hosted to the original logssince the csm has had issues with as you put it loose lips what do you feel makes you exempt from that stigma if you were elected to csm 10
what are your thoughts on fighter assign
marlona has been smearing his hot steaming opinions all over various fora for years now and has proven again and again to be unreliable clueless and irritating coupled with his penchant for leaking information he is trusted with as evidenced by the tmc jabber log leak i am sure he will be a good fit for the csm
over powered needs a serious look at limiting where fighter assigning can happen solution could involve not allowing fighter adding if a pos towerpos shield or station is closer than 100 km maybe slow the speed down to zero of the carrier to prevent align to safety whe assigning coward tacticsmaybe the best solution is to remove fighter assign completely till it can be reintroduced in a more balanced way
1 all the way
notorious for uninformed unfounded opinionsso i guess hes perfect for csm
so what are you running for story telling butterfly effect buzz wordswheres the beef

ok
marlona can you talk about the tmc jabber logs dump and why you felt that was necessary or the reasoning behind it and what reassurances can you give us the community that such a thing wouldnt happen with more sensitive things like csm skype logsreference
marlona can you leak me a convo where it is clearly explained why you would be a good fit for the csm
marlona really cares about the game and he has shown time and again that hes prepared to put in the effort not just to identify an issue the easy part but to analyse it and work through the components and identify the core problems that kind of analysis is exactly the resource the csm needs when it comes to dealing with the big problems we want them to represent to ccpit doesnt matter a tiny bit if you hate the solutions that marlona has proposed because to be candid ccp devs tend to ignore solutions proposed by csms and for good reasons what they absolutely do take on board are well reasoned properly presented analyses of why x is a problem and why its going to create further problems down the road or how y can be an opportunity
its not too late to run again yourself you know
nah a good con man should never get greedybesides the big downside of a free holiday in iceland is that its a free holiday in iceland
yeah my wife questions whether we can afford any more free thingsthat aside marlona welcome to the race looks like you have your share of both supporters and detractors which i take as a good thing you make wavesmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
good luck with that you logleaker
marlona has demonstrated that he is particularly well suited to the office of csm his willingness to compromise and his flexibility are well documented others might be inclined to stick to their guns stubbornly on issues great and small marlona has compromised on such issues and will probably continue to do so marlona has demonstrated a remarkable ability to hold nuanced views on unequivocally stated positions which is as with real world politics vitally necessary to accomplish ones goals in any real capacity that these character traits are indeed adaptive to csm service can be seen in the spirited endorsements of csm members past and present this are no mere conjecture on my partyou have my vote
thanks for the welcome it should be a rather entertaining race so far nothing i cant handle would be nice to get some more real questions instead of the ultra exaggerated and flat out lies from some people though but nothing i wasnt expecting from the usual grrr marlona rabble
heres a question for you i know you spend a fair amount of time helping newer players ingame can you talk a little bit about that and share some of the most serious challenges youve seen them struggle with during their trial period and for the first couple of months ingame what are some methods you would like to see ccp employ to mitigate the most common new player struggles
that you dont want to answer them doesnt make them any less real so far everything youve claimed was untrue has been truthfulultimately while leaking personal information was bad judgment everyone does something stupid every so often whats really worrying though is the apparent inability to own up to a mistake that personal information was in those logs has been so welldocumented to be undeniable so one has to question why you try so hard to insist it was not there and that everyone saying the sky is blue is lying rather than own up to that you made an error in judgment and saying that youll do better next time an inability to own up to mistakes is not a good trait lying about them an even worse one
ill try phrasing my question another way should people in a working group like the csm with access to a nonpublic channel like skype or jabber have a reasonable expectation of privacy and be able to have candid and honest discourse about the game
can you leak post a list of these grr marlona rabble you speak of it might make csds job of keeping this thread clean easier if you rat them out
why should i choose only one platform when i have experience with each of these individual aspects of the game would you much rather want a csm representative that will only push for their little piece of space or do you want someone that will try to make the game better as a whole

i stand for a better game that has more tools in it i want to see all areas of space prosper i cant say much about low sec it is the one place i have not lived at length in yetyou will see me on one hand saying things like how we need to nudge people out of npc corps so they stop hiding and farming isk with greater security how miners need actual tools to react to live long enough for friends to warp to them and help them how null sec blobs would benefit from absorb modules so logi might pop but they might stop people losing the target lottery and vanishing instantlyi dont favour any one group i just want a game that requires more tactics strategy and such beyond just gathering up a zergso i favour better mechanics regardless of opinions from people complaining that it will change their way of play often they are defending it tooth and nail because it is broken and unbalanced
i havent either mostly because it is boring and for the most part devoid of defining characteristics fortunately sugar kyle has it in good hands

hi tora i am interested in your campaign especially in your ideas for adjusting crime i feel it is excellent that you slide both ways seeing problems with an unbiased view where most slide too far to one side or the other on such issues there will never be too many clearheaded candidatesi wish to apologize for passing up your campaign thread on my initial pass and wish to get to know you better as a csm candidate before voting opens up i have a feeling i may wind up adding you to my growing list im hoping you will also consider contributing to my highsec reform thread in jita parkthere is a large turnout this year of good highsec reform candidates with great ideas across the board and im really hoping it means the start of something great highsec needs a lot of work and its about time that work got under way ive already spoken with a casual gamer mike azariah a staunch defender jenshae chiroptera and an attitude reformist sabriz adoudel so itll be nice to add the ceo of marmite to this listas to your ideas i have no gripes or changes currently just not in the mood but i am very interested in such things as improving ability for prey to fight back giving financial incentive to hunt people for their implants and encouraging atk gameplay
joined wormhole space this year as a bitter vet 10yr looking for something different  it workedin doing almost everything in eve can say corbexx has been the only csm representative i have actually interacted with at a couple of his townhalls he even came onto tdsin teamspeak to get our views on some changes and who seemed to know what he was there for and ask for opinions sure we might not always agree but he has been a great representative of the wh community and csm in general when i saw he was standing again my vote became a no brainer 1 regarding some of the comments abovelike the idea of some degradation of untended anchored mods there is so much litter in space hacking to unanchor it sounds good as requires skill and effort not just after a while bring ship to scoop stuff tbh we all know pos mods etc need a revamp eg why do compression arrays work on solid minerals but not gas which should be more compressible and volumes of which get big very quickly or why do we need so many different assembly arrayscorbexx has been a great representative and should be again
you missed the whole point of the question i dont want to argue whether it is an isk faucet or not i wanted a link to a piece of writing on the subject that corbexx finds particularly good
not a writing but the results from all my pve testing
okay forget the subject completely link a post that you admire for being really well thought out and is the sort you would like to see on the forums more
i remember running c1 sites adjacent to a c2 because the c2 sites were worthless it was all about the frigates because they dropped the most expensive loot despite going down the quickesti hear its not quite so much like that anymore which is really good also the value per nanoribbon is under half what we were getting for them back then mid 2012 we would sell the things for 8 mil apiece to the already available buy orders or we could put em up for around 9 mil and get them to sell
population distribution is a zero sum game  the more people and the more stuff you put in hi sec the more you are going to concentrate the population there and keep other areas barren when a great many ills of the game could be squarely pinned on the concentration of population in hi sec this seems like a poor choicehave the people who want the content come to low sec if content creators want to follow them there fantastic more l5 hubs possibly even neutral l5 agents sure these are good but they belong in low sec the rest of the game is already suffering from the content and income present in hi sec
i want to unpack the caveats that i added to the post about balancing rewardscurrently theres a fair number of resourcewealth creating things you can do in highsec mining level 4 missions level 13 missions incursions anomolies noncombat exploration combat exploration belt ratting ill exclude more immediately competitive activities that redistribute wealth rather than create it such as trading or suicide ganking and pi production or invention as they are mostly set and forget operations rather than processes you are engaged in while you gain resourcesof these several are clear wrong choices from a game theoretical point of view belt ratting anomolies and level 12 missions offer so little in rewards that noone would consider doing them for the ingame rewards players that actively enjoy one of these activities find the game sharply pushes them out of their preferred activitythen theres the second tier  mining level 3 missions level 4 missions for corps with bad lp rewards incursion scout sites combat exploration and noncombat exploration these provide resources that generally arent worth bothering to fight over but that people that actively enjoy the activity wont feel they are wasting their time for doing them noone actively enjoys mining but thats a totally different issuethen theres the top tier  incursion fleet sites and level 4 missions for the sisters these offer so much in the way of rewards that even people that do not enjoy doing them wind up feeling obliged to run them or feel disadvantaged if they still elect not toi would not want to see level 5 missions added if they would fit into that last category id rather see a rewards structure that once you factor in expected losses makes efficiently running level 5 missions in highsec on par with the current rewards for running level 4 missions for a nonsisters corp as for lowsec and l5s  i do not see any evidence that l5s are drawing people into lowsec and do not consider them important to low at all highsec incursions 0102 belt ratting for clones and mordus spawns and fw all offer better rewards and a lower risk compared to any of the main ways of doing l5s solo with a carrier solo swapping between blinged missiontailored neutresistant ships spidertanked battleships fleet with logi if i felt l5s were a unique thing pulling people into low i would agree with you they are not the games premier repeatalmostondemand group pve content that is c56 sites and incursionshowever i will repeat my caveat in different words  if l5s are added to highsec and the same broad reward formula is used as is used for current l4s they will actively make eve worse just as highsec incursions make the game worse for almost every nonparticipant in them balance is key

people are not all minmaxing automatons just making sure the rewards fit in with other hi sec activities which may be too high in the first place would not prevent lots of people from engaging in it im not sure about drawing in at least not presently but the groups built around the level 5 hubs i know about dont seem to mind the income from them more l5 hubs in low sec couldnt hurt and could let more groups move into places the point im trying to raise isnt so much about the state of l5s in low sec its that putting more of anything in hi sec is feeding a problembut again people are not minmaxing automatons giving people another reason to stay in hi sec even a suboptimal one is bad i still think this comes down to you approaching this problem too mathematically  people are not rational actors the game is full of people doing suboptimal iskhr activities now i think you want more missioners in hi sec so you have more and more expensive targets to go after which while i cant argue against that being a good thing just like mission runners shouldnt have everything available to them in hi sec neither should you the antagonists have the best selection of prey in hi sec
i look forward to the article but i have to say im quite dissatisfied with the communication that csm9 has rather hasnt had with the player base
this is a content creator people and that is what keeps eve movingmy vote is with chance
youve got my vote tooyouve managed to bridge the daunting chasm into which new players often fall after spending too much time shooting stationary rocks and red crosses truly there is grand content to experience after training a raven that does not involve cancelling a subscription and chance has done much to show the way to those who dont realize there is a way
i like the direction of your ideas around exploration and deployables also giving hackers a job in fleets would be a nice thing
i was sharing some ideas about the future of evelegionvalkyrie on reddit but thought they might have some value here the pastingformatting is rough but you should be able to follow the basic idea thereo7
very interesting
thanks i think itUFFFDs a great idea there is a balance to be struck with social groups being in a corporation should still have advantages  disadvantages and i believe the challenge facing ccp and the csm will be to strike that balance and make sure they have distinct roles and purposes bringing it in game makes sense to me because these groups already exist we use them daily but itUFFFDs just that they have no formal structure in the game this means that at the moment to run one of these communities you have to live out of a channel and a mailing list or more than one in some cases or have it experts on hand and design  program a web site maybe if you are lucky you can rely on existing web services however these are at the mercy of 3rd parties very often and can go away just like that and they have done in the past leaving groups high and dry thats definitely not a situation we want to persisti would love to see social groups in eve become the new way we enable some of the less socially engaged players to take a more social approach to gameplay they can join in on communities with less commitment than joining a corporation and also less scrutiny im sure weve all seen and recognise this comici can see that people have legitimate concerns about how social groups may impact the game in particular things like wardecs which are a big reason people dont want to form a corporation instead of a social group however wardecs are not the only way to disrupt these groups and as long as being a member of a social group doesnt completely replace corporations and the two have distinct roles and purposes i would hope that would balance outin whatever form they take social groups definitely need to be something that are introduced to new players as well as soon as possible because this is a social game it works best when you interact with others and the people that engage with others in the community are the ones that stay the longestjayne has quite a list going there and the only one or two i have real disagreement on the first of these is group contracts i can understand the desire for these however to balance out the corporate  social group system you really need to have some distinctions and i believe contracts is one candidate for this the second is fleet to fleet standings mechanically i could see this being a pain to implement rather than this i would like to see fleet size caps increased this would ease problems like golden fleet and ganked 100 standings generally are not issues you face if you are in a corp  alliance and itUFFFDs one of the things i feel may be a good differentiator to balance out social groups against corporations and alliancesas for things i would like to add labels are relatively new and i would like to see labels included as a resource for granting  denying access setting someone to bad standing because they are a pain and you dont want them joining your fleet can have unintended consequences i would like to be able to say  deny access to all the people i have labelledgroup bookmarks or linkable bookmarks being able to drag a bookmark into chat is something i would also like to see that would benefit the npsi and similar communities i would love to see a wider range of drugs combat boosters available in eve more multi bonused drugs like quafe or new drugs that would affect things like overheating or agility i would love to see changes to the mechanics surrounding drugs as well transporting them for example to make it more engaging to play as the drug runneras for implants i would love to see learning implants go away to one degree or another i like in principle the idea of them being rolled into base stats which is friendly for new bros but has the disadvantage that you cant minmax your training as much if you are an experienced player hardwirings are a whole other matter and i was already in the process of writing some words on that subject so please bear with me on that oneim afraid iUFFFDm a chocoholic
but thats not how supply and demand works you either drastically nerf semipassive minings rate to the point its not worth doing so people will actually do the active version or you make the active version several magnitudes more valuable but since this is just grabbing resources it will just increase the mineral influx driving down all the prices until the active version is at the same if not slightly above current and the passive is no longer able to make any income whatsoeverremember gun mining that was basically the pay attention and get more minerals than regular mining option ccp removed it because it ended up being a significant source of minerals and a primary reason why mining was such  income then to begin with
im pretty sure that when ccp banned broadcasting many people came up to the same conclussion oh now that multiboxing miners arent reliable in huge scale the market is going to be damaged eve is going to diepretty much the same when ice belts were removed etc the reality is that people will adapt to new mechanics and will always find a way to take advantage of themremoving botting from eve is very important and be on the screen should always be more rewarding than not in highsec you simply are a drop in an ocean of horrible tanked mackinaws that are going to die in a 05 so you feel saferninjagas mining in a c6 with a week old venture can net you more isk than mining with a full skilled mackinaw per hour of course risk is much bigger
gorski are you perhaps a bakain what way would you influence the direction the nex store is taking i vouch for for gorski he is max honor tom cruise would approve
how do you stand on the accusations of repeatedly shitting up the swedish language channel ingame jk i endorse this product and  or service guy knows his  and probably undertands the limits of his own understanding as well
you should vote for someone who attend the meetings where he feels that he can actually contribute with stuff   gorski carhere jayne i corrected your quote so it does not stink of so much bias also it is now 100 more quote and at least 50 less paraphrasing to make your argument seems validgorski 100 back what you said here if you dont know anything about c6 wh mechanics and dont know why sov is a pain in the ass to grind then i dont want your opinion on it you do know small gang pvp and you do know the value of balance between small gang and large fights and this is why you will have my voteside note please for the love of god put supers on the same level as titans i can think of no scenario where a super assigning drones has helped increase mortal kontent
you know its funny we dont enforce an official thing your votes are your own unless youre angelus x most years theres only one or two guys who want to try this year there are 4 guys in pl whod like to try outive been super critical of past pl csm guys and mazzi for a relatively low level of communication xander is a fairly engaging guy and if you consider what the man does for a living and that he still maintains his level of activity csm wise youre left impressed hes a solid choice in internet spaceship politics
i endorse this product service and or candidate
helloread the complete platform here
pity reply
my name is bhock and i am one of the contributor of the capstable podcastin early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10here is our announcement
yes vote the psycobitch xenuria ticket
1 wow yeah no especially to someone who supports the crews thing shot down so many damned times2 you do realize ccp has already been fixing their hairbrained ideas for the last year or two right or were you hoping to pull a move out of the politicians handbook and ride any good choices ccp makes in the next year based on previous csms advice as your own personal achievement for reelection3 wow im surprised ccp would let someone amed psycho run i mean geeze theyve forced renames on players with much less offensive names
lmbo good luck getting an honest answer to this wellcrafted and reasonable question
q should a csm candidates constituency be the entire eve playerbase or is it right for them to ignore people or alliance tags they dont like
ignoring someone because they fly a different corpalliance flag or enjoy a different part of the game than you is a terrible philosophy to have as a csm
the days following this is eve trailer was amazing in the rookie help channel the place was flooded with new players with what seemed like the same tutorial snags it was amazing to see the veteran players jump in and tirelessly answer the endless flood of questions while the current tutorial is infinitely better than what i experienced as a new player it still needs work i spent a good amount of time in the rookie channel doing everything from answering basic questions to helping with antigank fits for their ventures even taking to skype to do screen shares and walking them through specific parts for one new player i spent an hour and a half with him figuring things out he is doing well in eve university and i believe planning on joint rvb afterfor changes to it i would like to see more immediate action for the new player to experience maybe they start off with limited control of a battleship and through the excitement of the battle they learn a few thing like locking targets and shooting making things blow up whatever it may be as long as it puts them on the edge of their seat craving more
why were you brought up in the csm minutes
what do i do to help newbies good question sir
perhaps for the excellent article suggestingn jump range changes that came out before the changes instituted in the gamecould you be specific on which minutes which session rather than such a vague questionmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
removed a post discussing moderation
please point to the ultra exaggerated and flat out lies in the question i posed im curious genuinelysnip please refrain from posting private in game correspondence isd ezwaledit  marlona reached out regarding the leaks and sadly resorted to childish behavior to deflect the issue that he posted peoples personal information its quite distressing to see someone who wishes to become one of the more important figures within the eve community completely unwilling to accept they made a mistake its simply a sign of immaturity in that person
you mean those changes which have made the game even more stagnant than it was beforethose changes which were supposed to have increased conflict but only resulted in coalitions becoming even more entrenched
i that casewhat is your view on the coming corp and alliance revamp coming sov changes
just for reference the csm does have thisbacked by the nda which is a contract with not insubstantial penalties for breaking it
who knew this was a rule
im guessing you are talking about pheobe and the jump fatigue mechanics what need to be understood is the situation in null in regards to coalitions is it is not just power projection but the way sov works that is keeping things slow in regards to change what we currently have is the dominion sov which is actually an incomplete version of what was intended dominion sov requires an unholy amount of structure grinding to accomplish anything factor in instant structure damage notifications and any small group will have a tough time taking any sov from a coalition before they are able to sound the horn of gondor and everyone showing upmy hope is that the new sov changes will be the opposite of soul crushing i believe taking and defending sov should be mostly automatic and based around enjoyable activities for a good while there has been a steady flow of ideas from the players on what these activities could be perhaps the sov in addition to a completely revamped pos feature would mean those select few who do logistics for hundreds and in some cases thousands of players in their alliance no longer meant they were having to do things that murder their jump fatigueso when you combine a good sov system with the jump fatigue which has many ways to adjust that is when you will see the idea of a coalition like we see now become obsolete imagine your alliance having enough content for itself and no longer requiring 30000 other players from dozens of other alliance to be able to hold a region or two only having to travel a handful of jumps to reach the front linethere is still of course addressing the issue of industry related activities in null having to depend on shipping in so much from jita is not goodwhich is why it is important to make sure those on the csm are very keen about these issues and help guide ccp towards these things to help the players enjoy the game more i strongly believe i am one of those candidates who should be on the csm i understand you have a mandate from up high to vote a specific way but if you take a moment and think about your game play and what is best for it i look forward to your vote
it is important for corp and alliance leadership not to be bogged down with arbitrary ui to do the most basic things needed which is something ccp are already neck deep in changing from my understanding a ceo director logistics manager as well as many other highly important roles to make a corpalliance function should not require them to spend eons performing those tasks they need to have a good amount of time to fly around and pew pew someones face if they want basically they need to have fun too filling one of these roles is challenging enough as it is dont shackle them with unintuitive user interface as welli explain a bit on my view for the coming sov changes and what i hope they will mean in the post above this reply
just want to point out i am happy such a thing exists and will gladly sign it i work in the film industry and nda is widely in place to protect a lot of things from start to finish people work extremely hard to present a film that hopefully is enjoyable for the target audience my daily life is blanketed with nda related stuff it is nothing new for me
1flown with marlona on a handful of occassions since meeting back in 0708 he is a damn good pvper content creator and always been vocal about his thoughts on current meta much of which has been goodconstructive criticismalso he was the first pers
is it opposite day where you aremore has happened since the phoebe changes were announced than in the 9 months before them they are literally the best thing that ccp has ever doneand i can tell you as a matter of fact that marlona contributed to making them happen
can you elaborate on this a bit i seem to recall a statement not long ago that was ratified by literally every major 00 alliance leader expressing dissatisfaction with the state of 00 and the need for changepost phoebe every major power bloc has shrank its holdings and the size of its afk rental empire except your own alliance which has doubled down on its holdings and collected even more rental property to become the largest afk isk generation operation in the history of eve
