recently i have been advocating for work on the mining of eve and the love it needs mostly in the features and ideas it seems that more people in other posts are doing so not because of me current mining is suffering and needs ccp to look at and look at it not from the iskhour idea that most people see it asis mining safe compared to other professions yes it is but other professions have more options available to them look at nullsec ratting people lose ships in there but there are also people capable of bringing more secure ships like carriers that dont even take a scratch except when hostile players shoot themso is mining safe when other people can bring more ships or new tactics that dramatically increase their survivability and income at the same time and receive the same risksmining is dependent on the player run market when you assume iskhour while npcs are not they receive the static bounties on them so how can we balance it we cant and i accept that unless something about rat bounties change and this i am not advocating what i want to see is a rebalance of the mining profession all together many of the modules lp store and distribution of the minerals are problematic or uselesslittle things issuesore miners only a range bonus this is not exactly useful in mining yes range is nice but the asteroids are not running awayharvesting implants the lowgrade set for harvesting is again a range bonus not useful for the pricemodulated miners this module is unlocked at mining level 5 however you can not use any of the ammo for it you would otherwise suffer a loss using itmining crystals required for modulated mining lasers but takes 31 day for just all tech 1 crystals twice that for tech 2 does not have any mining skill prereqsmining drones while yes some people do use them they seem to be pretty lacking in comparison to others mining wayslarger issueslimited tech tree there is a large gap in effective ships to use current mining ships make a plausible expansion of the tree difficult without making other ships obsolete or increasing the new ships risk new content like my resent post of how to expand the resouce gathering treenull sec industry pt1 the difficulty for the 00 industrial index is far too difficult to maintain and raise even if it is raised there is such a small if nonexistent benefit for itnull sec industry pt2 while the idea of removing the need to scan down the asteroid clusters seemed like a good idea the already vulnerable and easy to kill miners will have even more problems living with their limited tree after the warp speed changes the now ultra slow haulers who are midwarp will be extremely likely to die with an interceptor who is now nullified waiting in the beltnull sec industry pt3 mexallon while i like the interdependence for null and empire there is still a massive deficit in null skill tree skills ship skills not included related directly to mining are limited to exception to drone bonuses 7 skills with mining crystals its 23 prereqs like refining not included needs to be streamlined and some expansion would be nice like a mining rof reduction and range bonus skillsnow you may say that i am focusing on nullsec mining this is true i am because i think that nullsec is what needs the help for the profession the most highsec i am fine with the concord support is safe enough in my opinion and the fact you only have to deal with npc frigates is not much of a problem any issues in highsec would be solved with the little things changesthe point is at the end of this does ccp truly understand the issue with this profession which is necessary for the eve game play to build things for people to blow up now that drone poo is gone does ccp even plan on acting on this profession without brushing it off will the csm push for an overhaul on this section of the gameplay which needs it
im not so sure about that from what i see it seems to have spawned a large group of massively wealthy incredibly overentitled fuckheads who whine shrilly and unendingly whenever anyone else dares to touch what they think is theirs by right its like everything bad about highsec has been distilled into one groupyes people will shoot incursion motherships in case you forgot thats what theyre  there for what they are not there for is for you to sit on like elvis on his throne farming more piles of isk to horde or spend on pointless bling youve already been told what works against the tactics you described and the things you claim are stopping you are only stopping you because you cant be bothered to make the effort to address themby you i mean the op and his ilkinsert clip of willy wonkas you get nothing scene here
i would like to see something for reaching various levels of proficiency but it cannot be something to do with gameplay perhaps an optional skin on ships you achieve mastery for so for example i love the merlin and now i have mastery in it i can select between the standard skin and the mastery skin from the isys screen
making it f2p would break the gamesimple as that

if youre complaining about scammers then eve is probably not a good fit for youat the very least save your complaints for a scam that is new in some way
thiswelcome to evedestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
is there a single scam older than this one seriously
bumping for justicenot because of this toon i love my main here its an alt i bought off an old friend so an 04 toon didnt get biomassed that friend def did not care about naming conventions its painful to even login with the name hes sportingas for reqs dont tie it to just isk baaad idea we all know isk is not a balance for anything  coughtitanscough  just give it a oneyear cooldown a x changed his name to y notification to all watchlist holders and an entry on an alias tab all ideas that make sensehell you could even make it use the remap counter in conjunction with all the above requirements has a certain totalrecall loreflavor to it eh esp for those characters on the bazaar whore maybe looking for a completely new lease on lifest
the only problem with mining is that its boring it really doesnt matter how easy make indexes to maintain nor how much sp it takes the system is uninteresting and just simply work many of the serious miners multibox 6 plus accounts while doing something else irl to occupy that part of the mind that requires thought i tell you enoughnot one more suggestion or request unless it is to ask ccp to make mining fun if they cant remove it all together and make asteroid harvesters that deploy like these new pos siphons
mining is hopelessly onedimensional and passive and the whole process would benefit from a complete reworking to inject some variety and activity rather than miners warping in activating lasers and going afk for 30 minutes
helloi support this idea i live in a wh and the ore bay for the refineray is way to small even for a single person many of you have said that this would be unfair to those who owns the stations with refining i think that the idea that the refinaries at a pos is skilled based with a bit greater lose than a station something like 515 loose with max skill and that it take some time to refine would still make people that can use the station refineries continue to do somy wh have a high sec exit and you can not bring in a freighter you can bring in an orca but you can not jump back and forth with an orca because the wh will close quickly and you will need to do alot of jumps on diffrent exit and to diffrent trade hubs to get the ore out the cargo space for the orca is big but not that big that it will deal with all the ore from one day of mining using a mammoth or similair is not an option either because their cargo bays is way to small for the job looking at either the orca or smaller industrial ships sums up that you have to do alot of jumps to get the ore out and that takes timelossing the 25  and having to put up with a small ore bay in the refinaries is still the best option if you can not use a freighter but that does not meen that the current solution is great because it is not your idea howewer is greatkind regardslizden
wow somebody is in desperate need of a hug

interdictor bubbles should cause aggro this current state is stupidtonight i jumped a gang of capitals to a gallente station a flycatcher then undocked and dropped a bubble on us we couldnt warp in the bubble to cause it aggression so it just docked waited a bit and dropped another bubble we had no choice but to slowboat the carrier fleet 35km to get out of range of the dictor undocking and slowboating with invul and then dropping the bubble and dockingyesterday we had 2 of our carriers tackled on a gate by a long range sniper gang that had 2 sabres and 2 arazus the arazus were no problem we could shoot them and push the points off field the sabres however not so much they could jump in mwd cloak bubble and jump back out of system our carriers were stuck for over an hour by two ships that didnt even get aggressionlast week we dropped dreads on a gate and sieged the enemy gang responded by running back home keeping the gang docked and sending 6 interdictors back to the dreads and using the same tactic of mwdcloakuncloakbubble jump we managed to slowboat the dreads out of the bubbles which took 30 minutes before their batphone arrivedto me this all seems a bit wrong why should a ship have such an effect without even getting aggression the only counter i have at my disposal that i can see is smartbombs but i cant smartbomb bubbles on a station so they are useless to me there so basically if a dictor wants to waste 30minutes of my life with no risk they canedit capital ships are used as the example as they are ships that are slow and therefore cant burn out of a bubble easily
tldr make dictor bubble launchers give an aggression timer when activated or when someone tries to warp out of onealso first
nomad pls
sense makes this
i totally second this post
yeah bubbles causing aggro would make far too much sense
bubbles need to cause aggro this is probably the most broken they have ever been
anything new happening in this field any hope for pi 30 anytime sooni highly appreciate the worki just started playing eve and i think that theres a beautiful world out there but you can do nothing with it
id say the op is the one in need of the hug oh waitjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
maybe some kind of npc arena where you scan down a site and it has a single lieutenant npc who is basicly a t2 ship of whatever size and you fight him for a near guaranteed c or b type drop and a couple of thousand units of faction ammojust throwing it out there a kind of semi pvp encounter a la dark souls npc invasions
i believe the icelandic constitution contains the doctrine of htfu
the algorithm could be relatively simple base it on what navigation command was last issued if it was to approach an object or to manually fly via double clicking treat it as a bump but only once per navigation command orbiting keep at range undocking and aligning actions or simply flying in a direction you are already pointed would not be tracked as bumping thus eliminating most accidental bumps from consideration while making it relatively difficult to bump repeatedly and intentionallyallow half a dozen bumps or so before concord warns them to knock it off reckless pilot warning  then 23 more after that before a suspect flag after the reckless pilot warning is given if the player has green safeties on the navigation commands which can produce a suspect command should ask for confirmation of those commandsit might also be worthwhile to use the same algorithm with different rules for ships knocked out of alignment as they are trying to warp giving them an impeding navigation warning with a chance of getting a criminal flag if they are still on grid when a ship they just bumped is criminally attacked this would address the problem of outside assistance in suicide ganks the chances of this could be based on hidden factors such as past use of outside assistance by the ganker and how close the interfering pilot still is when concord shows up
i heartily endorse the abovementioned product andor servicehaving taken advantage of this mechanic a time or two it does seem a bit broken
bastion modules cause a weapons timer but bubbles apparently dontyea thats kinda broken when a purely defensive module causes a timer but an attacking module doesnt
trying to engage warp to a location off grid whilst in the bubble creates an aggro timer you just need to be quick to do it to a ship thats trying to complete its job and get back into safety if you do i believe the shippilot gets an aggro timer and cant dockjumpif dictors never got aggro from bubbles you would never see dictors on killmails because of a warp interdiction probe and i can tell you ive been on killmails since the last patch for precisely that
you do not appear to have read or understood the first post
i have and the only issue i see is that trying to warp whilst either in siege or in triage meant the checksum hit the siegetriage brick wall before the bubble stopping warp brick wall the only other possible issue is if technically the dictors can bubble up after theyve sent the jump request ie the server processes the deployment of a warp interdiction probe afterduring its processed the jump command
weapons timers were removed from interdictor bubbles soon after the implementation of the new crimewatch to allow the dictors to jump and keep up with their fleets if i remember correctly e nope retribution 10 perhaps the change was before release the reason is correct though im not arguing against the op mind im just producing the reason probes dont give a weapons timer allowing the interdictors to remain with the fleet is important but the situation described in the op is bordering on abuse of the mechanic
and shorten the invul timer from undockingjumping from 60 to 30s aswell
put it back to the old days of when you dropped the bubble and someone had the foresight to try to warp in said bubble aggro was started make these lazy dictor pilots learn what it really means to time things or beat feet seems an exploit at current
trying to warp in siegetriage wouldnt cause aggression on the mechanics anyway due to the fact that you cannot warp anyway interdictors and interceptors are going to travel even faster come rubicon combine that with an invulnerability of just being able to dockjump due to no aggression is stupid
i would agree that dictors need to keep up with the fleet so no to launching bubbles as a source of aggression timerif you launch a bubble and someone tries to warp while inside of it though yes to making that start an aggression timer
maybe make the action of launching said bubble and activating a gate  docking having to occur on separate server ticks rather than the same that i believe it is currently meaning there will be a 1 second difference between the bubble being dropped and a docking requestjump requestgenerally peoples reaction times are 250ms so would seem enough of a difference to do something with it
still doesnt solve the issue where an agressive module use doesnt induce gun timerdrop a bubble  60 sec gun timer deal with ittoo easy to bubble and dock in loop with actually no way to be caughtand a check on the undock lenght both time and actual physical lenghtalso a stop ship order shall drop the invulnerability this is non sense invuln is made for ppl with a bad connection to actually catch up preventing them to be killed before actually seeing the outside if they issued a stop order they are in control why shall they remain invuln
no the other way aroundhaving people try to warp near the end of the bubbles life is what really extends the aggro timer to stupid long levels and prevents the dictor and fleet getting aroundalso you could still land at gate  launch  jump before anyone tries to warp
it is wrong that you drop capitals as solo pwn mobiles on gates without support to kill supcap fleets or ships capitals are meant to be fleet and support ships go home with your elitism pvp and get some friends in support ships
supportsupportsupportyou sir are text master
i feel your pain however you need to consider that interdictors are meant to be ultimate pwnmobiles and better than other forms of tackle so your arguments are invalid
please tell me where i said i had no support i said none of the ships on field can even lock the interdictors due to a combination of no aggro and cloakmwd trickgo cry about getting hotdropped somewhere else
the problem isnt support we quite often have support you cant lock a ship that can instantly redock or is on gate and just jumps through
also i would like to point out that capital ships are used as the example as they are ships that are slow and therefore cant burn out of a bubble easily if im in a vagabond ill just leave it still doesnt mean there isnt a problem that the dictor still is not taking aggro
your text make it seem like the situations that were described were put together theoretically and not a product of actually having those assets in those situations which makes me wonder about the legitimacy of your concerns
please check my killboard and corp killboard these are ingame events over the last week i used the capital examples from the last week as this is where dictors are most broken in these situations i gave ingame events as examples and you say its theory yet i even say in the op yesterday and last week why would i say that of its theory lol
ive used dictors on a gate to hold capitals down as well as dictors on a station to inhibit logistics in my opinion dropping a bubble should not cause a weapons nor pvp timer however if someone is inhibited from warping because of your hictordictor bubble you absolutely should receive a weapons and pvp timer it gets pretty silly when i can undock drop a bubble redock undock drop a bubble redock thankfully those of us familiar with game mechanics will simply drop a bomb via stealth bomber to clear the bubbles and then cyno out
launching a bomb counters the bubble the bomb also has a longer cycle time however this still doesnt counter the dictor itself that can just come back and place another the dictor still has no aggro which is the problemcurrently im going to have to field an entire ship to counter a single mod rather than a ship
the dscan almost never been changed and realy need to be upgradedrange  add distance selection ladder with 15au  10au  5au  1au  001au keep the possibility for custom distance selection but using au instead of kmangle  5UFFFD  15UFFFD  30UFFFD selection need more space between them add a visual effect in space that show a conecircle where you looking at when angle is lower or egal to 90UFFFD add it to the 3d solar mapoverview  allow us to load a different dscan setting than current overview maybe allow to set a custom radial menu to switch fastmiscellaneous  add a keyboard shortcut for the scan add a small visual timer between 2 allowed dscan use or simply let this scan button unclickabledscan is a very usefull tool he need to be redonethx and fly fun o7pantorus
cant help but agree that dscan could really do with some work
dscan probably need to be replaced with another tool that fulfills the same function but better or at least in a manner that doesnt cause rsi
i do not care whatsoever about the topic but i just wanted to comment on your hilarious name it kinda reminds me of milhouse manastorm from that other game you face the mighty milton middleson
way to jump on the blame the victim bandwagon well played
eve online is about competitionthey make isk they deny you easy iskwhich also stops inflation works as intended
wait someone else killed the mothership in an incursion exactly what you are supposed to do with an incursion its like the end of level boss and now you are the victimget over yourself jint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
you are only a victim because you insist on being one that is obvious from your attitude throughout this thread have you actually done anything to modify your situation beside wringing your hands and crying for outside intervention
yes yes i have but the entertainment value of stringing along you holierthanthous for your anticarebear selfrighteous indignation is too priceless to just shut up and let it end do continue
yall been puppetmastered
ah so now we go from needy self entitlement to im trolling you reallyhonest i wonder if that would still be the case if you had found a sympathetic earah well 010 for a sad attempt to spin your way out of the hole you dug
you are correct if i had received a sympathetic ear i would have had no expectation to snicker at the overabundance of meanspirited twats in this game who rather than politely tell a carebear that his complaint is invalid instead exploit the anonymity of the internet to behave like insufferably juvenile douchebags again thanks for the entertaining display of the dark side of human nature im happy to return the favor by whining about it truly a symbiotic relationship
personnatly i move often and i always use the f11 solar system map to scout and to optimise my dscanbut i never look at constellation region and univers map i simply dont need themeve is a game of windowsfest every place on screen countit should be veeeeeery cool if we can separate the f11 window in 4 parts we could select witch ones we need to keep move it where we need her to be and have that littles maps singled out as a resizeable windowthx and fly fun o7pantorus
about 8 months ago i posted about reviving pirate ship logs and tying it to exploration content since then the concept has received overwhelming positive support with only one person having issues with the ideai think this simple idea has a lot to offer long term and it would be great if the csm would bring this up with the ccp devs at some point i know that malcanis is aware of the idea he thought it was pretty good iirc but i dont know if it has had any movement since thentldr  restore pirate ship logs to the loot table allow them to be bought and sold on the market they can be used  analyzed to create an expedition future iterations on the concept may include special mission arcs for pirate factions and combining a set of logs for special expeditionthis concept could even be used as a way to find the new ghost sites being released
i still think its a pretty good idea as soon as s i get properly back online ill try and pursue it
thanks malcanis i  you forever and ever  
and while youre at it isds can we look into that irl threat thing because thats pretty despicable especially from someone blathering about cyber bullying
just going to point out in any competitive environment yes the option to walk away is valid refusing to do so and subjecting yourself to loss is not the other persons fault but your own for acknowledging the risk and failing to mentally prepare yourself for the consequenceseve online is a uncaring beautiful monster any one moderately well adjusted in life can deal with its trials and tribulations without having to cry about cyber bullying of which i would say this is a stretch when someone does something foolish and their picture is plastered over the internet any attempt to try to get it taken down will just backlash into it spreading fasterits best to have a humble well balanced response to these things evaluate if you can move past it and continue or walk away as opposed to being so wracked by how could this happen to me that they want a safety net to stop them from being so stupid next time
suspect flags for miner bumping will create more opportunities for pvp
after reading a lot responses here all i see is the common place in a lot of threads discuss an issue that is a consequence as if it was a cause bump is a normal game mechanics that can serve to a fair purpouse within the game universe and it is just a way of harassing people because something else the game mechanics allow not the bumping persebumping can be not only a annoying thing but a regular strategy we use in our industrial only corporation to help in gate camping counter actions pirate persuit and emergency warp delaying until interdictors arrive the problem is not the mechanic of bumping but the strange thinking behind ccp development team that for honest naiveness or condescending dismissal impress on texts how eve players are and how eve universe is when everyone know that a small fraction of people is remotely like the way they say eve players are and a very few people is or ever will be able to enjoy the game as they say it isi sure have nothing to complain about eve it is the way i first found it interesting and still is and it is unique among mmos the thing is it is not due to the reasons the site adverts it is but it is unique in the sense that no mmo out there has such lack of regard in giving people equal chances to achieve goalsin wow a lvl 90 is there 90 already  say warrior can one shot a dozen newly created chars which prevents groups newly created with the sole purpouse of doing that in eve someone like that famous guy can alone create a dozen chars that need a few days only to be able to do lone ganking but you usually will find people with 2 or 3 accounts that want to get together to do a ganking fast you can use 1 week chars to do a lot of things that wont even reflect after you delete them damn 7 people can plex their way into making a whole 10 hisec system into a death trap for weeksand people still complaining about bumpingthere are two powers power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other but nothing compensates or add to having neither politics if you dont use it it will use you
a single bomb can counter many dictors popping all of their bubbles at once this might only by you a small window before they rebubble but if you are weary this gives you the window you need furthermore an instalocking arty ship can sometimes blap a dictor before it redocksjumps
the argument would be legit either way as long as interdictors were able to act as tinker describes they arethe fact that players can mitigate negative consequences of a broken mechanic does not address the issue of a ship being able to negativelypositively affect others in a combat situation and then immediately escape something the new crimewatch mechanics were designed to prevent and something that eve should not includea weapons timer from players trying to warp out from a bubble means that the interdictor can still negatively affect players with the bubble and then leave as long as theres a period before someone attempts a warp also this extends the amount of time a fleet has to wait up for an interdictor pilot to lose the weapons timer since someone may attempt to warp at the end of the bubbles life meaning the dictor has to wait for the bubble to vanish and then sixty seconds more giving a weapons timer when the bubble is launched means the dictor does suffer being at risk for a time if they choose to attempt to affect other players in combat but that they also have a good chance of being able to keep up with a fleet
saying bubbles should only cause aggro when someone tries to warp is like saying bennys tornado shouldnt be shot by station guns unless he scores a hit on that frigate
i think you are missing the point of someone needing to try to warp in the bubble or someone being pulled out of warp to start the weapons timer because if i was to drop a bubble on a station and no one but i was in system should that give weapons timer or if i was 100km off a gate and only one in system that is where there needs to be something to cause the weapons timer as you were stating that about shooting at frig and missing as you cant just point your ship in a random direction and fire turret weapons
these changes were needed 7 years ago how much longer are you going to ignore one of the games fundamental tools
i am back i also still fully support my own well thought out and epic proposal
10
limit carriers to 5 drones but give them 20 drone damage per level so that the damage stays the samealso double fighter base damagethis would make the interface cleaner and most importantly reduce lag
it would also remove one of the carriers main defensive abilities which is unique to its particular class of ship
how would it remove anythingcould you clarify
is drone lag even still a thing
my main still has all my old pirate logs id love to see them come back they were fun 1
first of all i would support this however i would suggestion a couple of adjustments1 link from some low sec system which is next to a hisec system2 make the jump distance so that no capitals in current space can cyno there3 to make the space dark cold and big remove all the stuff you get in the eve map and dotlan like kills cynos npcs killed etc as well as localremoving local is only part of it you need to remove all that information that enables people to find people so easily in current space this would then be an eve i could relate to something damn hard and rewarding proper hunting play blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
as a rule of thumb you can rule out harassment everytime you have a sine qua non clause demanding the active participation of the victimganking is harassment you dont ask to be ganked some people beg to be but it is not a condition sine qua non wardec is flamed by some as a form of ccp legal harassment tool but you activelly open a corp and wardec is something that comes with it if you are in an npc corp do not attack or seek revenge do not open yourself to theft or any other action or inaction that in any way facilitate the act done to you and you have no means to protect against it then it is harassmentisk doublers are scammers always period as is anything that offers something for nothing everytime you are offered something that isnt usually bringing something to the one offering it is a sort of scam that if it is not you the victim someone ispeople usually complain in the form of i have this problem i have been a victim of this and when you do this you are just doing the same thing you are complaining about which is someone that just bother when something is done wrong to thembarely no one come to the forums and talk about things that happen to everyone or something they find out they can do and have an advantage if someone find out that game mechanics allow you to force a person out of their ships and you take over you will only see a post when a person is a victim of this and the thing is usually people will come with such a post and then tell he said i should click eject or he would shoot me lolcmon people make ccp spend time on something really importantthere are two powers power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other but nothing compensates or add to having neither politics if you dont use it it will use you
yes if you drop a bubble on station and noone was in system that should give a weapons timer because you can drop a bubble on a gate and jump immediately and the bubble will effect anyone who jumps in hictors still get a weapons timer when they activate their warp disruption field dont theyok let me sit a smartbombing bs on a gate with smartbombs cycling but no weapons timer until i hit something thats not a gate no if i do an aggressive act i should gain a weapons timer
no and no
drone swarms have always been hard on the server now that missiles are no longer mini ships i assume theyre official the most resource heavy module to calculate ccp has throughout the years made updates both to ai for drones and database values used with drones to streamline them at this point the performence hit doesnt get felt unless there is more than few hundred drones on field realistically its as about as good as its going to get you suggestion makes the capitals more vulnerable to opponents killing off the drones without giving anything in return while i wholeheartedly agree with death to all supersthis wont have much an impact as the current meta of the sentry drone doctrines will guarantee that drone counts from sub capitals will by and large outnumber the capitals altogether
this has been done before carriers used to have 20 drones and dominixes etc could field 10drones have since been changed to be far less resourceintensive by ensuring they dont collide with most shipsobjects theyre nowhere near the resource drain they once were the largest bottleneck by far in big fights is still the session change especially players enteringleaving systemthe one thing to be said for drones in this case is that they were never redesigned with the weapongrouping feature that turrets and missiles received as theres obvious practical issues in the way of that i dont see it being resolved anytime soon
it definitely is when you have 300 carriers deploying 10 sentries each
no as it is with 600 sub caps deploying 5 drones each so clearly this is not a capital specific observation
i cant make any promises the pve team might well have their own plans in mind that dont include pirate logs but id like to at least see them brought back to empire they could be a valuable tool in encouraging newer players into exploration and visiting nonconcord space
i fully support removing map related intelligence gathering map should not give any statistics on kills and pilots in space all such information should be gathered by individual players players can choose to share it in their intel channels
dscan is used every where every time thats suprising that ccp never upgraded this
id be happy even only with an option to save 3 preset ranges
if it is too hard to work around the realism of the body they could and should even for the mug shot to make better hairsthe better looking hairs look like a day in frying in mcdonalds kitchenthere are two powers power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other but nothing compensates or add to having neither politics if you dont use it it will use you
i assume that if people in ccp are more professional than 13 yr olds doing computing class they dont render things in the server which makes renders and colliders a client lag not server lag the server takes time to respond for requests because the client takes time in formulating them but serverside everything may happen text like communication so server lag has nothing to do with models or colliders but who knows maybe ccp does server rendering  just kidding devsthe main issue is that eve is a resource demading client which cant be done in the state of todays technology as it is but less demanding maybe for a ton of people that doesnt care to buy a good machine to play or wants to see shinny and shadows glows and blows the clients gets stuck all the time but either you buy a better machine lower your graphics or get over itlessen the game to enhance overall performance for average computers wont be a good idea blizzard tried it and failed lolthere are two powers power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other but nothing compensates or add to having neither politics if you dont use it it will use you
fixed
by definition small corps and alliances have friends already your post is stupid
would be useful and save a lot of time
as much as i am pve averse myself i know many who would welcome this as interesting content
this
agreed this needs to be sorted very much so please put forward as something that needs to be done
problem where solution why when people started booming around usa making small corps that had a clear advantage of mobility and tight leadership big corporations like intel and ibm saw their empires being bitten piece by piece by small local companies that alone were not a threat but each piece was one piece and when several pieces are put together they become a huge chunk eve is not different it is not hard to small corps to get a foothold it is hard as it will always be to confront many being few adn trying to do it aloneif or when people wake up to the power of numbers or devs do something about it huge corps will most likely to start render their power to small loyal corps and will have the advantages of big corps and the advantages of small corps that is what any manager will doin any social competitive environment you have the power of numbers and the power of leadership the problems of numbers are solved by better leadership and the problems of leadership are solved by the diminishing of the numbers good leaders lead small numbers of leaders leading small numbers of leaders and so on until you have the operational people no measure from ccp can turn against it and not be against the small corps at the same timeboils down to who have the better management of the bigger number good leadership of low numbers is as weak as bad leadership of huge numbers that is all that massive multiplayers games are aboutedit in that regard try to think why renting your unused potential to others is not only about money and that is the way people get allies and cost effective operativesthere are two powers power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other but nothing compensates or add to having neither politics if you dont use it it will use you
i am a loyalist to my choosen empire i mean and although i have characters in each playable faction i have choosen one that all of them are loyal to even against their races they have their reasons for thatwhat i propose is a counter strategy from the empires to the changes brought in this soon to be xth free expansion eve devs like to stress that tightening securities adding top layer rewards and making their way to what would really be such a reaction for the growing independence from themconcord assembly could add one layer of security status that prevent what i see and do often which is break hell loose and jump to low sec shot few pirates in anomalies go back and wreak havok again you less bounded by the parameters of lore may ask why i loyalist does that and i answer i am loyal to one and friend to one empire not the fouranyways i think that all the playing loose goose with penalties standings and etc makes exactly the contrary to what it is intended for if people want to see things blowing up you may want to converge in a path that makes people have nothing else to do after a whileit is pretty comfortable these days the life in empires they give targets give advantages let the targets come easly into their space and things are being blown up very often but very broinglyif you guys use rubicon exapansion as a excuse to make hisec more tight people with shady or loyal tendencies will meet more often in the border zones and compeled by having nothing else to run for the confrontations will get bigger scale instead of little skirmishes here and there people will have to watch their backsone thing i really see as a waste of resources is the fact that small confrontations and small scale gankage are more supported than group interactions in empire space this is not realistic into the lore of eve people are stranded capsuleers are powerful and misunderstood they would start to stick together because the us against them crap would be savage from the part of the empires it doesnt make sense that all the effort is made to facilitate alone confronts over full blown carnage in the bordersmaybe it is because i know conflict regions in real life and i see what happens but i feel that all this skirmishing in hisec crap very unlikely and unrealistic to really unleash the kraken you have to have islands of security people can prepare and be ready to fight and full turn the ass to the wall zones where people will be in terror for their lives huge empires reasonably secure everywhere is just boring every place dangerous is boring having ships being blown up for no reason is boringas i said ccp has an idea of eve players that very few players live it up but if you put measures in place that makes everyone responsible for their acts they will choose sides and the us against them crap will do the restthere are two powers power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other but nothing compensates or add to having neither politics if you dont use it it will use you
this is dumb and wrong chat has no bearing on how much lag and or tidi you get sorry this myth was debunked by ccp years ago
which is to say that it used to have an effect now it doesnt except insofar as your client pc has trouble with it
an idea that came to my mind to go with an automatically refreshing dscan was an activepassive scan option active is the dscan we have nowpassive will show you the direction of any ship thats running an active dscan providing you are within their scanning angle and close enough to their ship im thinking that the passive scan can detect active scans from some distance outside the range at which the active scan can see ships say passive scan can detect an active scan if the ship is within 15 times the distance that the active scan is set toso you can set your dscan to automatically refresh but the wider the scan you run the more ships that can see that youre scanningmaybe also let probes do the passive scan that way a cloaked ship running active scan can be located and decloaked
the problem with that is that we tried being nice all it got us was more bitching and willful ignorance why should we make the effort when the people were trying to advise seem to celebrate being stupid and doing things wrong
no i would miss all those odd names that keep popping up in local
why would you want it back it took years to get rid of it
i find it odd ccp would go through hell trying to get twitch integrated so how hard can it be to put back a revamped jukebox people dont like boxing in and out of the client to change music all the time some people like to listen to the eve tracks ingame instead of an exported soundcloud playlist etc
i dont like dscan at all clickclickclickclick but its absolutely essential in space and an automatic scan would be too powerful id prefer it was replaced completely with a system with the same functionality thats a lot less horrible to useif i had to ask for a change to the current system id want this
long overdue for a rework
it does need a complete rework
supported
i see no benefit in this
its not a rendering issue its a entity issue even if you tell the client not to render drone models its still the equivalent of 1025 new frigates jumping into or jumping out of system every time a single pilot launches or recalls its drones multiply that by 300 500 2000 ships on grid and the server entity tracking system goes tango uniform quickly add to that the moment they fire and the projectile tracking system crashes especially when they have all been assigned to assist the fc so they all fire in unisondrones have needed an overhaul for more than 4 years and no real work has been done to them just the token useless module changes if you remove the drone spam you will have to uber buff the tank as well as make them invulnerable to ewar otherwise removing a carriersupercarriers only source of damage becomes too easy and makes them practically useless on the field there are a lot of changes that would possible reduce the lag but the changes would have to come with a ton of buffs to counter this one change i would be for would be the way the drone control unit works currently the most lolworthy module in the capital arsenal make it a single passive high slot module that instead of new drones adds a percentage to both dps and tank per level correct the assist mechanics for drones where you can only assist ships that are in your squad unless in a command position fleetwingsquad commandgive carriers and supercarriers a command boost similar to but less than the titans more in line with their roles to encourage capitals to be fleet flag ships this will require some massive changes to fleet mechanics as well but i have no issue with capitals having better boosting capacity than command ships here is hoping that if and when ccp finally gets around to the capital rebalance after they get around to fixing the node lag wall that tidi bought them some time on but didnt fix the issue that capital drone issues is high on their list
no what he meant was to use some diplomatic skills to bring together a force to be able to work together and achieve the goal you know like everyone has done since the game rolled out whenever these changes roll out all i get out of these whine threads is that i am socially challenged ccp please make it so it is fair i need it to be handicap accessible
if you think the problem is squarely in the fact that some people dont have enough friends or that theres no problem then you have no clue just how bad the sov system is
despite reading that i am afraid i dont really know what your suggestion is something about islands and boring dangerous placesdo you think you could explain it simply the csm like short words also as a 5 day old player do you think yous should play the game a little more before offering changes to the gamejint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
ignore this post i seem to have failed at pressing the edit button on my last postjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
a good idea
sounds good
would be interesting to see the effect this would have
well once more it seems we wont see these ui changes for the overview at least in the upcoming expansionguys please help me promote this thread share it with other pilots and try to contact ccp members to make them know about it thanks
i was recently speaking with a few friends and they were telling me how much of a pain in the ass it was to move all of their stuff to another hub since their corporation relocated again i directed them herehelp drum up support so we can make this useful logistical tool a realityi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
1 great idea id like to see some form of this implemented
thank you for the support lets keep this spreadingi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
still getting griefed by deaggroed dictors lol we have to base our capitals out of lowsec instead of 00 non sov space because of this 
then report them for griefing  mechanic abuse  exploit and see what gms have to say about this issue
as this is a discussion about a perceived problem ingame this thread has been moved to assembly hallplease continue the discussion in a civil mannerisd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls
thank you 
i think it could use some work but i dont think any of your ideas would make mining that much better id like to see that ring mining thing looked at cant find the post now but i liked the version where you needed 3 or more ships flown manually to scoop up the asteroids in a net that has one corner attached to each ship thus requiring much more attention
problem isi really dont know how you guys mine because i cant be afk mining for that kind of time i imagine that you mine alone with no fleet no bonus with one mining laser in an industrial because if you have a fleet with a mining leadership at least foreman you will fill the cargohold of any mining dedicated ship in a few minutes i am not aware of any way you can automatically get ore from your ore hold to somewhere else if you can take 5 10 minutes afk mining sure your yield is the drawback of your lack of actions while miningmining cant be fun mining is what mining is you mention null sec so you gotta be having rorq support and a minimum of 17k cicle to be complaining and that cant let you be doing something else and maximizing your ore acquisition if you mine alone in null sec with non miner ship you are just wasting timewhile i agree that mining need some love i cant possibly think a way that the mechanics of mining would change to be fun unless they do the same crap they did with hacking and archeology and you need to click mineral clusters in an asteroid and the laser will pick that up and you do the farmville style mining which will make mining mining just needing more clicks but not actually making it more enjoyable just like hacking and archeologythere are two powers power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other but nothing compensates or add to having neither politics if you dont use it it will use you
1 would save lots of time although id be worried about the server load it might cause when creating a contract with 200 unique items my client gets buggy im worried what would happen if you tried to fit 100 ships at once
for this reason id be just fine with a 10 at a time limit10 at a time would be a massive improvement for basically all purposes sure fitting ships for burn jita 3 might be a long process still but for the weekend ganker the null fleet doctrine brainstormer or most other people it would be a huge improvement
no resets you train it you get to live with it
bad idea its fine how it is now
i was thinking the same thingfor example level 5 in gunnery allows you to use a cosmetic targeting eyepiecelevel 5 in mining whatever opens up a couple of pieces of dirty rough mining clothessomething that you can use to show you are skilled in that specialty but give you no bonus over other playersjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
id vote no on this the benefit of getting a certificate is having new skills you didnt have before dont need a monetarylpwhatever additional reward also
not empty quoting
first you may not run out of things to train even if you started your char when eve started you may be in lack of core skills or focused on one faction one profession one line of one side simply you can do the math to have all skills to be reasonably bloating you have only useless skills to train you must have been playing eve longer than eve existedneverthless the idea is crappy anything free means no value if eve is cheap enough to have people running around as if isk grow in trees and have no maket respect for peoples ingame work you assume that the only reason you pay is to train skills they still have to have infra structure paid space and processing allocated and so on even if you dont log in but is entitled to so there is no logic there is no reason and there is no value in making it happenthere are two powers power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other but nothing compensates or add to having neither politics if you dont use it it will use you
hate to say it but i actually agree with lykouleon the fact you would even bring up making a carrier able to deploy the same number of drones as regular ships really doesnt even warrant an intuitive response however i hope you are reading this so that in the end you can waste your time reading my post just as i have just wasted my time reading yours
i do not support this especially the dont send a message when attacked a structure should send a message when attacked i am not a fan of null power blocs but it would be incredibly unfair to them they would have to scroll through a long list to make sure theyre all safeand for those that care in the slightest about realismwe have carhouse alarms that call you when triggered so why would a piece of spaceage technology not alert you with alarmsmessages when shot at
the answer to the specific issue in this thread is indeed lack of friends or allies or will to cooperate with a larger number of people towards a common goalsov mechanics has its flaws but in any way the difficulty of getting sov by a half dozen people is one of those flawsthis assumption added up to the assumption that devs must priviledge solo pvp over fleet engagements is what really wrecks eve universe you can never make numbers powerless in a mmo and the try even to satisfy partially those who demands it both fail to do what it is intended and hurt the game experience for everyone elsethere are two powers power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other but nothing compensates or add to having neither politics if you dont use it it will use you
homem na estrada doesnt seem to be grasping what the problems with the sov system are and seems to be treating the symptoms rather than the cause
the premisse of the new expansion is to bring a level of independence to capsuleers from the empire and set a stage for empire power to be challengedit would be nice if the empires responded accordingly making things harder for those who choose to go that waywhat i suggest is that lines are drawn between capsuleers wanting freedom and loyalists like myself to the point that it start being us against them the ones that choose to defy the empires must suffer the consequencesas it is now there is only advantages in regarding the empires as just safe guards of your endeavours standings can be easly recovered security status is a joke concord response is far from a threat and enlist in factional warfare rewards arent really as it should be it is the right time to start drawing the linethe line must be drawn here this far no further  jean luc piccardps five day old character doesnt mean five day old player but i think you know that as you have been playing for a long time right there are two powers power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other but nothing compensates or add to having neither politics if you dont use it it will use you
i have liked this thread before ill do it again
i very much doubt that we need more concord intervention
because ccp never put mechanics in place that are intended to help one thing and serve to be abused in five other waysthey should use a unique rule for aggression applied to everything if it affects another ship it is aggression it doesnt matter how that impacts on the ship if you want to have your interdictors in place be mindful of where and when you deploy if you deployed something potentially affecting yourself negativelly that should be taken into considerationthat is the kind of wishful thinking that dominates parts of development and things are done to be nice for one reason and become nasty loopholes for five other reasonsbut i also know that it is nothing that cant be avoided by simply planning ahead as much as it is a broken mechanics it is also not impossible to counter just require what no one out of industrial and covert game like to do plan and scout when you move specially heavy slow shipsbubbles and noncloaked bubblers show in dscan so you can have an idea if there is one in place and more or less where it is as i recall that may be the case for low and null sec therefore the places where by default you should be careful and use the instruments the ship give you maybe wh life made me paranoid and i cant live without dscan and covertblack ops scouts but it is not a bad thing at all specially when you are travelling around with a billion isk shipyou want to see how people is careless around  drop a bubble say in the low sec between the hisec island in placid you see people in industrials and freighters blobing up on a bubble just because it is placed on their route most of the time you see the same person there over and over againwarping in auto pilot or just gate bridging in low sec is like afk mining you just shouldnt do or live with the consequences whatever they may be in hisec which that sort of thing matters you cant use thosethere are two powers power of numbers and power of leadership they compensate or add to each other but nothing compensates or add to having neither politics if you dont use it it will use you
just to update this with my thanks to ccp for finally trying to do something about jita

youre getting this the wrong way round the certificate is there to help guide you in squeezing extra out of a shipyour reward is being able to fly that ship better insert with slightly higher stats if neededyou dont need to be double rewarded
no just noi value the game and pay for a subscription to it except this year i have played and still do many f2p games and would not want to see that happen here everstop paying stop caring watch a community die and make no mistake    in my opinion community is what makes this glorified chat program in space special spreadsheets and allnom
both pls 
that is client side not server side same thing happens when you are doing a trade with mass amounts of ships that are fit you can see this for your self by having two clients up and watch as the the client putting the item in the trade window has heavy lag while the one receiving does not until the trade is complete and then the one receiving has lag while the one giving does not you can how ever fix this issue by getting your self an ssd it really fixes most of the lag problems anyone has client side since in ccps brilliant thinking made everything you do read and write to your hard drive instead of utilize ram
i would like to thank ccp stillman for silencing the jita spam bots yesterday what a fantastic treat in an otherwise normal day in local
i think this needs more exposure we could definitely use something like thisi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
sorry i am a hisec kinda guy for the most part is there a passive reason for bubbles one that dfoes not involve wrecking someone elses day if not then it should trigger timers not when it hits when launchedset a smart bomb off in a place far from everyone and everything does the timer start why i wasnt hurting anythingmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i agree with everything acept thisscanning at kms is neccessary sometimes it should be a choice not au only
what do you reckon to the chances of having the option to group types too seriously seeing a full page of combat scanner probes is pretty dumb
1 for mass ship fitting
add a save location option to the right click in space or right click on capacitor menui can see it is in the radial menu for clicking on ship but that isnt possible when cloaked going through people and places is time consuming and complex when you are panic warping
its not the point of just ignoring the channel the sheer fact that all jita local is is just constant spamming and scamming is annoying as hell its bad for the game full stop its the same annoying scams they been doing for 10 years enough already
it brought a tear to my eye to see honest nonbot scammers plying their trade in jita local once againwell done ccp well done indeed
or a key bind option for each one would be nice
well the ship symbols come with the new ship identification system so thats happening i really like the idea of buttons in the overview although i dont think one is enough there should be at least two one fore movement approach warp to and one for locking looting aligning and orbiting or more really that should be configurable by the playeri dont like tabs either having one list with filter groups would be much more useful we should be able to add groups and configure savable filters for them at will with no limitations like only five tabs thats silly if i want a group for every ship size sorted by distance to me then let me have it one more thing thats a bit strange right now the survey scanner should be integrated into the overview why do i have a separat window for it there are options to toggle the is locking you in the overview why not a toggle for can see units contained in asteroid also please add the volume to it is it really necessary that we do the calculations in our headawesome thread though keep it up good to see a ui thread that got noticed
i like showing my certs publiclyi worked hard to get them and now its being crushedthey may not have been used often but for those of us who do use them they will be missedplease rethink about removing content in this manner it hurts far more than it helpsits not too late please dont launch this aspect of the expansionits the only proof in the pudding for those not given an apii hope the rest of the eve community can rally to the cause
maybe you could lose the victim complex and actually put the insane amounts of isk you gain from riskfree farming to use and figure out a way to make it more difficult for these competing groups who work within the limits of eves game mechanics to kill the mothershipyour ridiculous proposal means that nullsec groups that run incursions with the intent of closing them immediately after the mothership spawns  because nullsec incursions actually cripple a constellation  would not have the means to do so and would be burdened with an incursion spawning again because of another change made to protect a group of players that dont even pay ccp for their subscriptions directlythere are legitimate reasons to end an incursion early you are not entitled to farm a single incursion for over a week because you consider your gameplay more important than that of others its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
you are not in any way shape or form a victimif you think that someone else running incursions properly and depriving you of freely farming them of isk instead of completing them makes you a victim you really should go play world of warcraft instead i hear the instances there bar other people from interfering with your gameplay
it sounds to me like those individuals are doing gods work
i suggest cspa charges for local with over 1000 members with the cost starting low but increasing rapidly based on post frequency simple effective and its an isk sink
ive only just discovered this forum existed this was one of the first threads i read what i see is jita local has too much spam traffic and it annoys me make it stop no solution no specifics what do you need to see in jita local i have a jita alt turn of chat flash its been there 2 years and not once has jita annoyed me ccp has shown that they are working on botters but there arnt many solutions ccp has bigger changes to concentrate on

certs are useless as they are and you want them to stay that waywhy the only thing worth displaying is hull tanking elite so people know youre a real man real men hull tank you see
youre trying to rally the community to the wrong cause if you like showing them off the cause you should be trying to rally the community to is the ability to show off the new certificates
id hardly call any of the certs newa reworking of a few and the removal of a bunch of othersjust a feature the game doesnt need to be dropping

hi guysid like to say thanks to ccp for all the great changes coming in rubicon and id like to follow it up with a requestcould we possible have an entire patch devoted to industry and structures as i believe these systems are being left behind and are overly cumbersome to work witheg from the list of 99 reasonable things 84 abandoned unfueled pos can be unanchored 97 jobs can be started from blueprints inside containers 98 allow batches of jobs to be done instead of inventing 1 bpc at a time you can put batches of 20 bpc to invent so you dont need to babysit invention every hour 96 manufacturingother jobs can use materials inside containers
it is a widely know issue when making a bookmark it can only be shared on a corporation level without doing a copy past transfer into all corporations in an alliance please make alliance wide book marks something that the csms bring up to the developersmr chafe
back when the events team put on the incursions events they had some tools that allowed a single actor to control many npc ships this allowed a smaller team to put on much larger events and gave them the ability to followtheprimary pretty much like player pvp fleets have a look for some screen shots of 50 nightmares shooting one poor players shiney shipapparently these tools have broke see here url

i have read most of the posts and agree with most of you that the current is good as far as abuse goes but im a new player and i still think there is alot of room for improvement for example bounty payout isnt anywhere near high enough to warrant an actual profession i dislike that and here are a few suggestions i think could work for both sides pirates and bounty makers make a way to create bounty contracts have the bounty hunters searchablehireable either by the bounty hunter picking up the contract or the poster seeking the hunter once found have certain info available like the hunters kill frequency a high frequency should suggest an alt friend contract conditions like who keeps cargo minimum isk amount for kill and pod kill and maybe any notes the poster may wish to add there are several useful things that can be put into a contract if this is a rout worth exploringim not sure how kill rights work but maybe add a way to have the bounty hunters to target some of the peaple with bounties in high sec like buying for a kill right on a person if they have several high bounties placed on them from several different players stops people from placing several low bounties on one person this would help kepp a ballance for those who regularly offendcriminalize people and those who dont the current system kind of works it stops people with alts from attacking themselves for profit and helps keep everyone happy by not having the bounty diminish overtime they are there cause someone got mad and wants to pay someone to have revenge which is why i think there should be something on top of the current system to satisfy those who place bounties and want them collected personally i placed a bounty on someone and im not happy with the result no one realy cares if they have a bounty i think thats wrong unless they want to be the 1 most wanted which is something to boast about but should be hard to keep
this would make life a lot easier1
just imagine all of the delicious tears if one of these got blapped and dropped someones faction battleshipi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
since you cant really make a profit on invention or manufacturing due to costs of materials why bother having the skillswhat with the theft of all items in customs offices and the tax rate hike of 100 from 10 to 20 planetary exploitation which takes a decent amount of time and effort is not worth it anymore it was barely worth it previouslyand currently trade is basically scamming with merely a winner and a loser not true trade at all if you are going to devolve the game to just ship to ship combat and mission running do itand give us credit for the time and effort we spent gaining skills in things which you have decided to make worthlessas a 6 year player i am just about done wasting time with this game mail me for my fire sale prices of modules etca disgruntled player

omg this thread is still active and mags is still here yup forum troll whatever floats your boat though might as well add another pennyi have not played for weeks an just got a 100 mil bounty from a player i have never met  action  bounty fine inaction  bounty not fine though i laugh at the fool wasting 100 mil isk and you people using my thread to joke around and try to get bounties is out of line if you want bounties get back in the game and earn them additionally i propse that any member of csm who post something as stupid or equally as stupid as put a bounty button on the forums next to the like button should be removed from office without questionso concord the entity that goes around flagging people for criminal and suspect status blows people out the sky for shooting at me in highsec the so called police will take money from anyone pirate or nonpirate completly free of charge with a minimum amouny absolutly anyone can afford and had over cash to anyone who causes them loss what happened to concord punishes they dont protectthis sounds like protection to meawaits additional bounty whatever idiots
i believe the recent controversy over changes to rlml and rhml systems with rubicon highlights a need for sufficient time for players to test and vet new game mechanics and provide constructive feedback prior to these changes going liveone of the key complaints about the changes to rmls is that the announcement was made barely a week and a half before the change was being launched with rubicon and only uploaded to the test server a few days before going live a common opinion is that the launch of this particular change should have been held for a later patch in order to give sufficient time to test it first but by the time it was unveiled it had already been included in the planned rubicon 10 build to many this felt like the job was being rushed out and halfdone and that feedback was ignored largely because there was no test data available to back it up i would think that those who are against a change such as this would welcome the opportunity to fully test out new mechanics prior to their launch as it provides them with the opportunity to test out their theories and opinions and share experiences that reinforce their position likewise i believe that those supporting mechanincs changes would also prefer this as if they truly believe in the effectiveness of such changes then it would be likely that at least some of the detractors would change their opinion once they have seen the changes in action having a reasonable amount of time to put new game mechanics to the test benefits everyone all aroundone of the statements on this particular issue was that it would be pushed live and then possibly improved at a later date the problem with this is that historically once a system has gone live it tends to be a long and laborious process to get anything changed once something is launched it seems to be forgotten or ignored and this often leaves players dealing with faulty mechanics for an extended period of time this is unnecessary and can generally be avoided with proper preview testing isnt this the primary purpose of having a test server open to the playerbasemy proposal therefore is this that any significant change to game mechanics be required to be uploaded to the test server for a minimum amount of time prior to its launch on the live server if ccp is unable to load a change to the test server with sufficient time before its planned launch then that launch must be delayed until such time that proper testing and feedback can be completedi will leave the exact minimum test duration up for discussion id personally recommend two weeks as an absolute bare minimum although i would like to see more minor tweaks or adjustments to existing systems can probably be allowed without this requirement but anything that changes the way ships or modules are or can be used should meet this minimumplease keep in mind that this is not specifically about the rml situation but something i believe to be important and valuable to any future changes the rml discussion has merely pointed out the need for sufficient community testing as a part of the development processwhy a switch onoff because the new animation doesnt add anything to gameplay and its graphically annoying in other words its worse than bad its useless simple as that   kina ayami

mmm this idea theres a few dozen threads for this floating around but whats one moreit continues to be a good one
i endorse this product andor servicei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
1if no effort gets put into live events they will continue to have issues a bit of devtime love behind the scenes would definitely help scale up the events better and make noneutz events more plausible
interesting but itd be a major balance headache essentially youre talking about adding at least two extra variants to most of the ships in the game presuming that the baseline models would fall under one corp or the other and since each empire has three shipyard corps thats doable but adding all that many different hull variants seems to me like itd primarily serve to dilute role definitions if a given hull has so many variants its harder to tell what a given ship actually does especially if that information isnt visible at a glance in the way that different variants of a given tech2 ship normally arethe basic concept adding more options for each role isnt bad but this isnt the way to do it a better way would be something closer to how say assault frigates work the gallente have the enyo and the ishkur both are assault frigates based off the incursus hull but both fly rather differently being from different corporations does that mean that theres room for a third af from duvolle maybe maybe not in particular there should not be a third af based on the incursus though there might be room for one based off some other hullthat said the idea would especially be interesting to add more options to other roles especially those with limited options as an example a creodrontype logistics ship designed to support with heavy drones instead of large remote reps would be interesting
this has been a good idea for a while but its more feasible now that we have wrecks that you can eject ships fromwith that groundwork in place this is something that could happen at any time the most timeconsuming bit would be the art shame there doesnt seem to be much support for the idea
ho yeah  really needed  1
if you cant make a profit doing something youre in the wrong market ive been there myself theres a lot of effort and math required to tell whether or not a market is desirable to get into and the profit margins are often stupidly low as such business models involving buying materials from a safe market and selling products back to that market are likely to be a bad deal since youre competing against people who think their time is free to make real profits you need to take real risksnotably prices especially for tech 2 stuff are vastly higher out in nullsec than in hisec simply for the convenience thats not a scam its just a supply and demand thing guys out in null are rich enough to afford the markup and pay it gladly for the convenience there are guys who make a killing running cloaky haulers out to npc stations but it does take a lot more effort and risk than sitting in one station forever buying and sellingif youre frustrated enough with the state of your gameplay that you feel you want to give up why not take some risks and see what happens after all if you were going to quit anyway youre not exactly losing out and even if you fail and die at least youll go out with a bang
no to opkeeping your head above water may be tougher in the crafting side than in pve activities but it is possible it is probably one of the most research intensive endeavours in the game you need to think it all the way through before you even startbut a profit can be made and the things in the game have to be made if something is selling below cost it either means there are too many fools impoverishing themselves which will self correct or you are missing somethingmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
ah you again lol  also try other sell point as jita wwwevecentralcom
do you guys on the alleged player representative board eve read the top forum and the bugs and workarounds sectionhave you absolutely any idea how many of your voting base cannot play eve in any kind of sensible way right now especially if they are pos baseddo you even give two  about it or are you just all im alright jack layabouts waiting for the next free flight to the land of rotten shark meathelp us fix the damn black images where our ships used to be use your internal thread to make something happen rather than running 16 hour fleets to knock down hisec pocosafter an expansion this big with this many bugs you actually have no claim on gameplay moments right now you put yourself up there for csm and knew the responsibilities of doing so so your place right now is helping us informing us and letting us know you are there screw the tweak this and that would be nice people right now you have a few thousand of your voters who have no game csm  cant say much
holy  the new expansion has bugs this is a complete surprise to everyone no new expansion has ever had any bugs before ever especially not in the first couple days after its release the csm had better stop flying in space and get coding to patch them right now because that is totally their job as opposed to anything elseseriously what are you expecting the new expansion just came out the new bugs are just being uncovered and ccp is naturally focused specifically on finding and fixing those bugs what do you expect the csm to do to get things moving fasterif you find a bug report it to ccp directly if its really causing you problems go the extra mile and collect whatever extra info you can through the sources available to you to help them along theyre working on those fixes right now so its a good time to do so but dont complain to the csm about it theres not really all that much they can do to help ccp fix alreadyidentified bugs after all
i am sorry to hear your game was broken can you please list off the game stopping bugs that are making the game completely unplayablei will get whatever resources i can together to bring the bugs to ccps attentioni checked your post twice for any detail on what the bugs are and cant find any you mentioned poss at one point but not what they broke i also looked up your other posts but could not find any  unless that is a bug too please get back to me soon i want to help but need something to go on
wah i too am entitled to far too much and expect instant gratification while i sip on my cappacino and marvel at the slimness of my jeans wah give me everything on my schedule screw actually thinking about how testing implementation iteration and troubleshooting are actually ccps job and not the csms abloobloobloo
confirming that starting in rubicon the bug reporting tool is now deprecated you should be directing all of your bug reports at the csm instead of the devs who can actually fix stuff
signed i understand that there was a lot of discussion internally at ccp and with the csm and other testing teams but there was very little time to test out this change on sisi and provide real feedbackin addition to the reloadmagazine size changes there were changes to fitting requirements not detailed in the dev blog post and forum post having more practical time to test this out and discuss fittings in more detail would have been helpful

though nice in principle its sometimes a tricky balance between testing time and actually getting the features out more time to play with features would be useful but im not sure if itd be worth delaying the expansion over
1the test server isnt there for us to fully vet any features they wish to implement sometimes they do sometimes they dont furthermore your stance is diminished by your focus on rlmls did rlmls didnt undergo a significant mechanics change from
there is no need for this its ccps game so they can change what they want and no one in entitled to anything in this game there is no issue with rmls the weapon is still good in many ways it just people are expecting it to be used the exact same if there is a problem with rlms then its the peoples understanding of how they work its like comparing a space shuttle which would glide down to earth where as a space capsule would just fall down both acheive the desired result but go about it differently i have been saying this many times rmls are hit and run weapons not sustained battle weapons use them on roams with a small or even a large group
wrong the test serve is there to test things out on it was first made for ccp to test new ideas and items out on yes its used by players now but its key that the people making the game test things coming into the game somehow before it hits the game the test server is the place for this its also a good place to test modules ships etc for being over powered and under powered and any other issues within the gameand again wrong ccp might have made the game but its the players game the first burn jita proved that upset the players enough and they could crash the economy of eve ccp knows this that is why they have the csm and also why they ask for players input about stuff without the players there is no eve things like rapids being completed worthless now and not being tested and being changed within a week or so before release is completely unacceptable all new ships modules and etc should be tested for at least a couple weeks to see if they have any issues and adjusted as needed to just through something into a game as in depth as eve is crazy eve has a fine line of balance it doesnt take much to bring that line off and eve also has a very out spoken and aggreesive player and fan base it wouldnt be wise to upset them if ccp wants eve to grow and to keep the player base it has it needs to do well thought out testing before fixing items before new items are brought in and it needs to remember eve is special because it isnt like other games and yes there are many issues with rapids now 40secs reload in pvp is worthless for one and wont be hard to counter at all once you know your enemy is using a weapon system that takes 40secs to reaload just find away to not take a whole lot of damage and when they reload you win rapids were op before but now they are truely broken and need to be looked at again a long with some oher missiles too the other thing is 40secs reload for a weapon system is a slippery slope if they did it with rapids what else might they do it with i think asbs 1 minute reload is odd and should be looked at again these just seem to be easy and fast fixes instead of well thoughtout and real fixes like old ccp would have done i hope they get back to that soon but who knows adding reload time arent fixes its an easy way out and if you disagree with rapdis being worthless come find me and we can play it should be a good time haha
i wouldnt recommend delaying an entire expansion over this just hold back on the untested feature again this is not about rmls  this is an issue which has been highlighted by the recent rml controversy and ensuing debate but it is by no means unique to this single feature and i would hope that people can be objective enought to understand the difference i understand that these idease are discussed internally however the one thing that all that internal testing cannot provide is volume data as an engineer who works in system failure analysis i can tell you that volume data is vital to any product release you can do all the planning and experimenting you want but you will never cover every use case or see all the ways in which your design can break unless you can gather data en masse even then there are things that may be missed but the larger the sample size the better the chance you have of ensuring you are releasing quality work this is why giving these changes adequate time on the test server should be considered a crucial part of the development processat the core this proposal is not about giving us time to learn the changes although that is a nice byproduct the key here is to give ccp the information necessary to release their features in the best possible state how many times have we seen featrues come out which upon release were either nerfed so hard that they faded into obscurity or on day one were broken by the players in a way ccp never imagined and become so overpowered that they dominate the game requiring this level of testing would not eliminate all such occurences but it should significantly limit them and hopefully reduce their severitythe sad part is that we should not have to request this requirement at all this is something ccp should already be doing for their own good and for the good of the game frankly the very idea that we have to ask for proper testing of features is shamefulwhy a switch onoff because the new animation doesnt add anything to gameplay and its graphically annoying in other words its worse than bad its useless simple as that   kina ayami
let me use a real life example for you i rent an apartment and recently the new management company said they are removing the indoor pool adding an outdoor one in the spring and revamping the clubhouseoffice many people were pissed about that those people believe they arewere entitled to the indoor pool being that they pay rent however they pay rent to use the apartment and amenities the management company owns the facility and has the right to do whatever they want to it so long as it doesnt violate the existing contact the renter agreed to personally i like the changes they are making a virtual golf center with 500 18 hole courses so goodbye eve among other things and will stay while other people clearly dont like the changed to the pool specifically that feature but there is no legal obligation in the contact that says the pool cannot be changed or anything of the sorts the company did specify that i could if i wanted to end my contact early with a heavily reduced fee due to the changes 15 months rent as specified in my contact for early termination many people have already opted to take this and end their leaseif you do think you are entitled to anything in eve or by ccp then you are horribly wrong for thinking that and you have the right to walk away at anytime ccp being a company obviously wants to give out a quality product for business but its their game they can listen to people but dont have to if you want to start another burn jita then go ahead over one module which needed to be changed since they changed it finding the new use for it to be most effective is what you should be doing
to be frank i while sisi provides the full volume testing you reference under special situations things like rlml arent volume tested there sisi provides players with a risk free environment to fully vet the mechanics when ccp changes some problematic backend stuff the volume testing is important when ccp changes simple stats it generally isnt
i disagree when you change a weapon system like this it has the potential to render it either completely useless totally overpowered or somewhere in between the more players who can test and try it out the more data ccp will have available to determine where on that scale this change will fall the test server may not provide the same volume of data as the live server but it is definitely more data than they are getting internally more data before release is always a good thing after release a lot more data will be available but there is a lot less motivation for follow up and improvement once the release deadline has been met people move on to the next project and few features get the post release evaluation that they deserve plust there is always the potential for catasrophic results and the ensuing fallout as such it is far better to do all that is reasonable to improve the features prior to release to do otherwise is irresponsiblewhy a switch onoff because the new animation doesnt add anything to gameplay and its graphically annoying in other words its worse than bad its useless simple as that   kina ayami
a video game isnt an apartemnt compnay people have to sleep somewhere but games well there are 100s of them and if you dont listen to those who play said game and mess it up enough that enough move to something else said game is gone in the real world you have to listen to the consumer and also the consumer isalways right not testing something and changing it 10 days or so before it gets adding to game is a good way to  those consumers off and show you dont care what they think do that enough and they will have enough of you and move onso if ccp wants to keep their consumers they should probably listen to them they didnt with the walking in officer quarters and aur and 100s of consumers attacked everything in jita and almost crashed the server as eve is only on one server and the market is 100 play based it wouldnt be hard for the consumers players to crash the economy andor server also if they keep adding things at the last minute especially things that ruin an idea in the game they will have th consumer loose faith in them and look around for other games that wont f them over so muchso should ccp listen to their consumer base yes do they i think so to a point should ccp test everything new coming into eve for a couple weeks yes should they also test anything that might be op or up before trying to change them yes do they have to no but if they want to keep eve going and keep the consumers it be a good idea
just putting this proposal up again for players who want to show support no need to be shy just step right up and post a 1dmc

helloas the title suggest hopefully we can get this back pleaseit was very useful and handy and imo convenient and nicely setupthanks
i agree the news feed was kind of useful found myself relogging at times to catch a bit of news i missedcsm could you nudge this along perhaps something like a news ticker like the eveonlinecom mainpage has72 can i avoid pvp completely no there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided eve new player guide

i think it is quite annoying there is an annoying blue haze for the fitting screen on any races ships i think that the backgrounds for the fitting screen should be similar to the one that comes with the 3d model in the information screen minnitard red caldari dark blueblack gallente green amarr gold so that is what i propose thank you for reading and i hope you support my cause
while your impressive sense of entitlement and overall extremely whiny attitude makes me want to just ignore you look a thread that had a dev working with players to try to fix the issue that ended in apparent resolution of the bug its almost as though this is a far better method of solving the problemit sure would be nice if you had any posts at all in the forum youre chastising us for not reading but nope literally your very first post on the forums at all was coming here to throw your little temper tantrum but its fixed thanks to the actions of people better than you now go patch your  game and make sure to clear your cache as ccp snorelax said to do in his last post
you do realize that mindless ing about this without any evidence of your claims just makes you look like a selfrighteous whining  i dont like reading about players not being able to play but at the same time typically they bring up valid complaints ie supported by evidence and with some form of a fix suggested if you have a problem present it in a professional and succinct manner with supporting evidence and a suggestion on how to better the situation and youll get more resultsuntil such a time go eat a bag of si am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about

there is nothing wrong with mining as it is now there needs to not only be different things to do but different levels of interaction as wellwant to put in a few minutes then go afk for 2 days then pi is for youwant to lock asteroids and switch them 810 mins later then minewant to play a slow activity for a long time then explorationneed constant high exhilaration activity then pvpetc etc not just different labels but actual different play styles with different temposyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
this is actually something that i discussed with team kuromaku when the character selection screen was in the works it was decided in the end that the new design for the character selection screen wouldnt include news because it has been designed with the future in mind to display other things and be themed for each expansionthe news is available through rss feed and on the community portal so theres no real reason to log out and back in again to check if youve missed somethingits entirely down to team kuromaku whether they want to put the news back in or whether it clashes with other design ideas that they have for the character selection screen however from a community perspective ill be watching this thread with interest to see what the rest of the feedback is likeccp falcon  eve universe community manager  ccpfalcon

okay first time stepping into the council hall let me put on my fire retardant clothing okay good ready for the flames my suggestion is simply really and though i cant speak for the totality of the eve community i believe many will be able to see its meritwith rubicon now upon us and the increasing power of the capsuleers in new eden i suggest a few new mechanics for the next expansion1 allow players to take control of regions within empire space not just by saying this is my system or that is my corps system but in a more concrete way make it possible for an alliance with enough will and strength to declare independence from the empire in control of said region obviously this would be more likely near the bordersmedium security regions and not near the capitals or 10 systems 2 allow players to force outdestroy the current stations in highsec empire controlled systems since we now have the ability to do this with pocos the next logical step is to be able to do this with stations we already have stations owned by players outside empire space so the mechanics are already present 3 allow newly independent systems the ability to hirecreatespawn what have you their own security forces since logically the empiresconcord wont be inclined to defend these systems any longer this could be tied into a new branch of the skill tree something the effect of corp management or empire control and obviously the ships used would have to be purchasedbuilt by the new ruling alliance this could also allow for these indepence movements to occur in lowsec stretches of empire space after their war for indepence is complete the new ruling alliance could convert the system to a pseudohigher security level wherein they set the laws ie no podding ganking miners is aokay all out pvp is the norm or soandso on this list is not allowed in this system 4 to create a more fluidrealistic process for these revolutions make the change over be something that requires a lot of work ie you will have to win indepence from the empire that controls said region if you win the result would be freedom if you lose the result would be a dramatic drop in factionempire status akin to fighting for the minmatar for a year and trying to fly into amarr controlled highsec5 this ones more for the cool points but whenif you win your independence your alliance will be upgraded from alliance status to nation status the alliance name will still be present but after it would be the name of the nation ie the bacon legion of bacontopia okay so theres my first post please be gentle
i beg to differ after the rubicon expansion i have the potential to gross 20 billion a month off one character with six planets i know math is hard but the numbers dont lie and now with the ability to run tax free pocos be it through owning them yourself or by using a little diplomacy with your neighbors the profits are actually higher for a player willing to learn how to use the system as for manufacturing please tell me youre kidding my corp runs blueprints for missiles in minmatar space we buy our materials outright instead of harvesting the minerals ourselves and we turn steady profit as weve grown weve started negotiations with nearby corps to form an alliance paid for by our pi and manufacturing this will drop our costs because most of these corps are mining corps and thus we will be able to create our own market for minerals which we will use to make more boom booms and more iskies tldryoure wrong or youre doing something wrong pi research manufacturing and mining are all profitable if youre willing to use a calculator which ccp was kind enough to put in game for you
this response bothers me a little while the character screen looks tons better than the old one it does so at the cost of functionalityas an example i tried to log in just now i looked over all the information available and found that i could not see what i ship i was currently in nor could i see where i was located at the bottom of the screen was an ad banner for a plex sale and when i closed that by clicking on the x in the corner did the missing information mysteriously appearthis does not bode well for team kuromaku are you seriously trying to tell us they could not create a new character selection screen that could display all the same information as the old one plus more detailed account subscription information minus the newsfeed and an ad banner at the same time im using a 1680x1050 resolution there is plenty of real estate available onscreena suggestion would it kill anyone if the eve logo and expansion name would be located to the far top left or far top right instead of taking up valuable space at the top center then moving all the character boxes a little upwards so that theres space for all the information plus an ad banner asking to remove the ad banners completely would naturally be the best suggestion but we all know thats not going to happen
it would be nice to see the actual taxrate for the planetspocos in the planetary interaction window
interesting concept but id envision it as being something thatd never happen in hisec on the other hand nibbling away bits of lowsec seems reasonable

id like to resurrect an old debate started when ccp removed learning skills almost 3 years agoandski wrotets a curious question  why do learning implants exist how can their continued existence be justified you need them to train your hyperoptimized perwill skillplan as fast as possible sure but why should you need them to begin withlet me begin by highlighting the problems with learning implants they discourage people from playing eve youre still paying your subscription sure but youre not playing the game you dont want to jump to your emptycombat clone and lose a day of optimal training so you can have some fun and then have to jump back to your training clone the next day this affects nullsec especially wormhole players doubly so  losing your ship in a bubble is a surefire way to get podded people in empire still have a better chance of warping their pods out of harms way and thus have no qualms about running missions or otherwise flying in space with their implants unless of course they are at war that however is not our playstyle they are seeded exclusively through lp stores rather than being made ingame entirely characters that need pirate faction implants for any reason supercapital pilots with slavenomad sets freighterjf pilots with nomads etc are essentially stuck with 3s but this isnt about pirate implants id also like to append something else to that list if youre buying things to risk when in space it should be because youre either moving it somewhere for tradelogistical purposes or youre using it to improve your general survivability while youre in space hardwirings generally fall into this category as the vast majority give either defensive or offensive bonuses to ships in space losing them is just like losing the modules or rigs attached to your ship as they are all for the same purpose however i feel i have a more elegant solution than andski my proposal aims to meet the following goals players arent discouraged from pvp out of fear of disrupting their training plan wormhole and nullsec players dont suffer skill training delays for their choice of gameplay style players who can only afford to risk lowgrade pirate sets for combat no longer have to slow down their training plan it will still be possible to gain a faster training speed if you have the isk to invest this faster training speed can be achieved by playerbuilt items rather than implants bought from an lp store part 1all current training implants are repurposed into generic ship attribute bonuses and renamed accordingly1 bonus basicgrade capsuleer enhancement2 bonus lowgrade capsuleer enhancement3 bonus standardgrade capsuleer enhancement4 bonus highgrade capsuleer enhancement5 bonus experimentalgrade capsuleer enhancementas a bonus this helps eliminate the current naming scheme for training implants that can be fairly confusing for new players limited neural boost  beta is totally intuitive guysslot 1 formerly perception 15 bonus to ship agilityslot 2 formerly memory 15 bonus to shield hitpoints slot 3 formerly willpower 15 bonus to ship velocityslot 4 formerly intelligence 15 bonus to armour hitpoints slot 5 formerly charisma 15 bonus to signature radiusthese implant bonuses correspond to the old attribute bonus so a 3 willpower implant would now give 3 to ship velocity other slot 15 implants that currently give an attribute bonus also receive the corresponding ship bonusthen do not give everyone 5 to base attributes to compensate for the loss of 5 sets instead give them a lower amount between 1 and 3 so how do we reach the old training speed with something newpart 2introduce a new set of legal boosters that give a timed bonus to a certain attribute this bonus depends on the grade of the booster but would be between 2 and 8 these boosters would last for several days or possibly weeks during which time the character gets a decent training speed bonus all training boosters would share the same slot meaning only one could ever be used at a time this means that a user would be committed to a single attribute bonus for the full duration of the booster and cannot switch until it expires however between the base attribute bonus and the potentially higher bonus on the new boosters characters could end up training slightly faster than beforejust like other boosters these new ones would give random penalties corresponding to the bonuses listed for the capsuleer enhancement sets this gives extra incentive to use these implants in pvp in order to counteract any negative penalties players using full sets of these implants would also end up generally better off than before even with penaltiesso is it time we send learning implants to the scrapheap alongside learning skills and achura bloodlines is this the right way to do it should the ship bonuses listed be different am i asking too many questions
yes i find it somewhat confusing that the implants werent removed along with learning skills learning skills were removed because they created a situation where new players were discouraged from playing the game for fear of less optimal skill training implants have much the same effect except that while everyone lost the same amount of training time to learning skills implants hurt newer players more than older players who can afford to replace themlearning implants force players to choose between playing the game without risk unfairly expensive deaths or subpar skill training the first and most common option is bad for everyone
i can get behind removal of learning implants surereplacing them with learning boosters though wtf that feels like itd be even worse
why not get rid of attributes entirely reddit lyrisnairn skype lyrisnairn twitter lyrisnairn
i proposed learning boosters here a month ago
i like this idea but the boosters should have a potential sideeffect and also a 1015 chance to fail a fail still lasts the duration of the booster so if someone tries a 1week 8 booster and it fails they cant use another training booster for a week
as long as learning implants exist cybernetics remains the last learning skill every argument that applies against learning skills applies to the cybernetics skill at the same time arguments for keeping learning implants can apply to bringing back learning skills but i dont see anybody calling for their returnas for boosters replacing them that would punish people who dont play eve enough to be able to afford the boosters so it encourages people to log in on days when they dont feel like playing just to do an isk making activity which then leads to burnout and people leaving eve even worse this will hit newer players worst of all because they have less capability to earn iskwell unless you make the boosters so cheap that their cost can be ignored well except for players in wormhole space who still have to worry about the logistics of getting boosters for their characters why do you hate wormholers making the booster only boost a single attribute hits new players even worse as they are far more likely to want to train skills from a wide range of attributes while my training plan for the next year is almost completely perceptionmemory skillsattributes in general just sound like complexity for complexities sake boosters only make that worse complexity is only good when it means players have to make interesting choices i dont see any interesting choices that come from attributes or any method to increase learning speed be they permanent learning skills and implants or temporary boosters
production of learning boosters should require the harvesting of frozen corpsesjust putting that out there
to be completely fair people who have expensive ship bonus implants also have the 19 hour penalty  play being discouraged after all if you want to fly something where every bit counts a capship say youll want a slave pod to go with it if you move between lowsec piracy and nullsec fights youll be swapping between something like a snake pod and a cheap pod with a 1 or 2 hardwiring yes this would address 5 pods but it wouldnt magically make every bittervet undocki like the boosters idea id also support getting rid of attributes although i havent in the past i realize now that the thing i like about attributes is the feeling that i can do something to change my training time which is otherwise a big monolithic bloc of ugh 10 days before i can work on something else i need
true i know i sometimes want to be able to quickly switch between roles and the implants associated with them but i think its something separate from learning implants plus something that will a solution more complex to implement than removing attributes andor learning implants
right i wanted to suggest this because it only just occurred to mewould it be possibly to sort different ammo types in different waysat the moments its just alphabeticalbut what about sorting it my something different such as range or tracking speedreason i suggest this is because well i have a bad memory and cant remember the the longest or shortest range which isnt tech 2 and which has the best tracking or whateveri currently have it down on a notepad just to double checkas for sorting could just be listed on the gun for examplevoid would be at the bottom and null would be at the top and then any range  tracking speed in between depending on how you want it sorted
sounds good to meUFFFD
to be honest you should simply move to zero sec what you want is thereyour suggestion just positions hisec to be taken over by the existing powerblock alliances and gives nothing to the little guyjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move

agreed 1when in the mix and swapping ammo on the fly the list can become a mess even more so if you are looting ammo that you do no use it still shows up in the list
the word of the day is compare tool in rubicon even added to your neocom for your convenience
i know its there and i know i can you it it just more convenient instead of having to keep showing info on ammo jjust because you may forget  so please stop try to be a sarcastic bastard  i know where the hell i can find the information on different ammo types
great idea we need more innovation such as this you got my vote
we need1 more yeild per cycle2 better tanking to mitigate gankers3 more ore hold capacity4 to increase ore yeild one more high slot on all mining vessels5 add to the list people
why after so many years of eve is it still not possible to put up a wtb contract for blueprint copiesa system that allows it could be pretty easy to implement in my eyes
prompted by this dt titan lossessentially you can probe out a titan or super warp to it and bump it if caught the pilot can literally do nothing to defend himself but activate hardeners you can not cancel warp you can not jump i dont even think you can activate a smartbomb this has been possible for a long time but now it is down right easy with the warp speed changes this is bluntly a  mechanic no where in the rest of eve are you so unable to change anything you the pilot are completely unable to affect the course of eventsthe only way to fix this is to make it so you are invulnerable during ewarp and cant be bumped making it so that the ewarp mechanic can be stopped in anyways opens up the old multi log jump out trick for those that remember it you could just have a friendly probe you warp and shoot you and than cyno outlogin ewarp should offer complete invulnerability and be completely uninterruptible 
there are a number of things that frustrate me with the current way the overview is setupthe way saving presets work is somewhat annoying over several patches some items naturally get added or modified and overview settings need to be updated in most programs you have the option to simply save over the previous copy in the eve overview you need to save as current type selection asdeleting an overview preset requires way too many clicks you click the menu up top lower your mouse to delete move your mouse again to said overview and make yet another click to delete it would be nice to reduce the amount of clicks required for something which should be so simplethe way states work is counter intuitive it will sometime leads to objects that you want to see being hidden it will also lead to objects you do not want to see being visible this happens because you need to enable bounty in order to see corp mates who have a bounty on their heads just to name one exemple there needs to be a better way to resolve such conflictswe need an option to change both brackets and overview at the same time this should in no way change anything to the ability to have different brackets and overview if so desiredthe text boxes in the overview settings are way too small especially given that you can enter html in them in order make the lettering bold change the color etc

simple answer minigame should add hidden cookies to make it more interesting a find in the ice if you can recover itbut dont worry lads there is hope go over to star citizen and get their devs to fess up to the mining design there and critique it properly i love eve online but lets get real pay to play 10 year old game with eve valkyrie as an extra addon vs first person new game modeled heavily on eve  new players are simply not going to join eve once star citizen hits because lets be blunt eve the game is often unplayable repeated server cluster crashes in nullsec sov warfare battles unplanned emergency downtimes unplanned extended downtimes every night this week it feels like  thats just not going to cut itso yes keep the ideas rolling but time to think outside eve now because love it or hate it that is where things seem to be heading fast
i am gravely concerned by the latest design direction confirmed by rubicon and subtly included in previous patches this is very badcore issues as i see them currently drone assist when drone damage range and speed modules and rigs were added no changes were made to how many drones could be assigned to one player the consequence is that fleet fights are essentially warp to broadcast hardners on approach launch and assign drones as ordered go make a coffee that is boring but the state of null pvp atm when you are going to get hit by 65 enemy archons drones simultaneously there is no point waiting to maybe click the need shield broadcast button if you are in anything less than your own space slug degraded stability a fleet battle of 3000 players could crash the server due to the drone mechanic now you need less 1200 or so can do it if you can bring carriers and supers that can deploy more than 5 drones each verdict it seems highly likely that due to the assist mechanic the server is trying to simultaneously calculate the hitmiss on thousands of drones on one target then update the damage back to every drone and its owner not to mention the spatial 3d and collision detection of all those drone objects when every player has to target their own weapons they never do so with mechanical precision same as when they press their f1 buttons so damage calculations without drone assist for a fleet are sequential and thus less likely to crash the server we have collectively learned how to crash the server at will in huge fleet fights so now what should be the pinnacle of nullsec warfare which will be the defining point of difference between this game and star citizen is a horrible slideshow with 20 time dilation in 1000 person dronefighterbomberfighter fights on a reinforced node which simply become a debacle because if your caps are at risk of dying you can just crash the server thats not good enough drone assist should be limited to double the bandwidth of the ship assigned to degraded audio performance why i think the warp to  mwd  ab additional sounds are contributing to server instability in fleet battles there is no sound in space but when you have large numbers of ships maneuvering together the server is paying for those grating annoying inappropriate sounds they took out the duke box then put the music for sale as a physical item in the collectors edition its a lovely score by the way very nicely played however audio wise i dont get why the sounds of metal scraping on metal listen carefully you may hear the train on a bend sound is simply all wrong in a starship unless you fly minmantar welcome to wowified ships the removal of things like being able to put missles on pilgrims and maelstroms has led to tic tac toe hyper specialization of core and t2 ships the result is just like in wow  you know what a warlock in pvp can do he has extremely limited choices how to use his abilities and the counters are all similarly known and yes pvp in world of warcraft is actually now more complicated than in eve online that makes me really sad afk camping in nullsec this is antiplay and as such anti player valid tactic sure but lets get real here  subscribers quit over this mechanic and have been for years difference is they are not going to come back to such an expensive real world cost year game when other games have better pvp star citizen is adding mining ships not because it enhances pvp or anything  but because they will attract more players guess where those players are leaving from you got it camped nullsec people like mining and like making things a game that gives them that will thrive all other things being equal but perma camping is just driving people out of the game either a player who is inactive for 15 minutes should be disconnected from the server to improve performace or cloaks should take fuel perhaps 5 heavy water per minute so people have to manage their cloak use rigs the idea was cute but the gameplay consequences combined with the latest changes are lethal combined with mods and ship changes a lot of pvp is now instant instant lock one click boom or instant warping interceptors and cranes etc instant is a bad word in pvp game design because it means there is no time for players to make choices right or wrong that affect the outcome if you think of pvp as a spectrum between shooting someone with a 50 cal pistol duel fencing lots of parry and riposte chequers and chess then you can see the pace of combat is critical eve used to be set at about the fencing level you made your move and the opponent often had a countermove that you needed to decide what to do about it was still fast but you had to think and react or die now pvp is really mostly just ganking the 050  or wow rogue interceptors invalidating nullsec gameplay options an interceptor can enter a system warp and point you faster than you can even see that they have entered system if you have high latency not even kidding while we have rejoiced in the juicy kills we have gathered the simple reality is that interceptors are not only fast they are just too fast to warp when rigged right either other ships such as covert cruisers and such need their time to warp decreased or intys need to be toned back a lot and if they are immune to bubbles bring back mines in nullsec we already have people like nulli anchoring hundreds of secure cargo containers to reveal cloaked ships if interceptors want to go fast into the unknown let people have a weapon to counter interceptors ie mines and maybe the ability in sov null to anchor up to 4 guns on a gate just to say hello why has the csm allowed wowify
1 the csm has raised this topic with the five0 devs on several occasions2 its possible that drone assist has this effect but you dont know for sure also see above3 pretty sure the server doesnt render any sounds whatsoever thats purely a clientside operation4 t2 ships are meant to be specialised i dont know how this comes as a surprise to you hyper specialistion what merely ordinary specialisations were lost with the removal of missile slots from the mael this smacks of mere nostalgia for irrelevent fluff5 pvp happens in 00 sorry you cant farm anoms with the same blithe safety as a mission farmer in a 07 maybe consider organising and leveraging your power as a group the same way the afk cloakers are doing6 instant warping is bad but instant locking is ok7 even with the new interceptors it takes 45 seconds to get to an anom if youre playing on a 5000ms latency connection youre gonna have a bad time stay aligned and stay alert oh and do that group thing i mentioned above
its funny how to local makes nullsec much safier than a hs and nullbears crying about it when someonedevs make a nerf to safety of nullsec james arget for csm 8
i think she said both is bad may have been edited tho
its funny how highbears who claim that null is so safe never seem to want to live there but there you go its a funny old worldoh btw cynos are coming to wspace welcome to 00
so we can finally bring to wspace titans supers and other compensating stuff spending our sleepers endless riches its funny to see all nullbers to dockup close all hatches because someone just entered local in cheetah or buzzardjames arget for csm 8
nobody is talking about getting the bitter vets to undock screw the bitter vets the fact that this is of slight benefit to them is irrelevantship implants are something beneficial to some ships and which give an edge in combat in exchange for a rather high price there is no need to use them if they get blown up youre out a bunch of isk but thats itlearning implants are different any time lost to inefficient skill training is time lost forever no amount of work or isk can recover it anyone who is training with less than 5 implants on a remapoptimized training plan is losing sp sometimes an awful lot of it essentially players are forced to choose between optimal skill training speed and actually playing the game game mechanics which actively discourage logging in are a bad thingthis unfairly affects new pilots who cant afford the implants then once they get the implants they cant afford to lose them it also hurts new pilots more because theyre less able to follow the longterm remap optimized plans that older pilots are able to do as a matter of course implants and attributes only serve to increase the already insurmountable skill point gap between new players and bitter vets
1 this is essentially an opportunity cost argument people arent losing skillpoints by using 4s instead of 5s theyre simply gaining them a couple of percent slower but everything in eve is about opportunity costs in the first placei could use your argument to say that ccp should give every player a gauranteed income because every minute theyre forced to spend making isk theyre losing a chance to play the game because theyre not out pvping2 to get to the root of the question should players be allowed to spend isk to train skils faster than those who dont spend that iskclearly you dont think they should but you dont offer a reason other than i dont like paying the price and i dont want other people to be able to pay for that advantage if im unwilling to3 your basic objection about losing skillpoints seems to be contradicted by your proposed solution removing learning implants would mean that everyone loses those skillpointsoh wait let me guess what you actually want is free permanent 5s am i right
why do people insist on using these as an excuse not to pvp so we remove them then theyll use some other mechanic as the next excuse and ask for that to be nerfed oh i cant pvp in that tech3 because i might lose sp etc etci pvp in my 5 imps either when i simply cannot be bothered to change clones or in a rush i also use far more expensive clone sets dependant upon which ship im using implants have never ever stopped me playing the gameyou cannot equate the learning skills with learning implants its simply not the same one was stopping you learning other skills and therefore skillz for 3 months the other is the by product of learning the cybernetics skill hardly a game breaking skill to trainoh and while you were sat in the station worrying about your sp per hour and the cost of your implants i was out earning isk and learning skillz whilst enjoying the game using said expensive implants because guess what its a game time to play itdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
lets say you dont have time to play but dont want to stop training there is this option in account management to pay half the usual amount and have access to training queue only nothing else
a refining array is designed to have shortfalls if you dont like it buy a rorqual like i didthis is not a problem it is an inconvenience and a justified one at that
in this hightech universe why do pilots still have to keep pushing a button to obtain a dscan even a programmed robotic arm could do it dont tell me this would be impossible to create in the eve universeso my suggestion is  program your dscan dscan is automatic repeating the scan every x seconds 30 a bigger delay than it could be obtained by manually pressing the button so there is room for skill same design as autopilot maybe even new skills to lower the number of seconds for automatic dscan or modify the range options or automatic calculation of au to kmtodays dscan is archaic there is no skill involved in pressing the button look i remember to press the button im skilled my version would still require setting the direction and range nothing changed here
dscan needs reworked entirely trivial patches like this seem like theyd do more harm than good the whole system needs rebuilt
completely agree particularly given the lengthy efforts made by a number of player alliances months ago to inquire about this ccp must take the time to address it at this point
so hang on this is the pilot getting caught and bumped at the spawnin before the automatic warp begins right if so i agree it should at least be possible to cancel that initial warp if anything unfortunate happens

planetary interaction in hi sec was barely worth it in the first place  the only thing we used it for was making pos fuel components so we didnt have to buy any 2 things about the new pi system really do not make any sense to me 1 why does the npc interbus get any tax at all since their customs office was destroyed and replaced by a new customs office from a player corp imho  they should get nothing the npc tax is eliminated for all by a poco2 why does a planetary launch off a 500m3 container cause a tax payment to be made if anything you are engaged in the time honored tradition of smuggling so no tax payment should be made if anything you should get a suspect flag from concord for picking up a planetary launch container  this lets the owners of the pocos have at you if they care to stake out the planet and try to catch you picking up your smuggled goods
1 because of game balance2 because of game balance

straw man argument making isk is playing the game you can make isk in eve without locking yourself out of a large portion of the game if someone loses out on making isk today they can make up for that by spending more time to make isk tomorrow lost training time is something that can never be made up making it a false analogyi dont care about myself i can afford the implants this doesnt seriously affect me this affects new players who dont have years of isk buildup laying aroundits what they did with the learning skills but i am not strongly attached to any particular solution

so t1 ships have been rebalanced capital ships rebalancing is planned but not scheduled and we just did t2 interceptors and eafs that means it will soon be time to look at my corps favorite ship class the stealth bombermy corp is fairly new 9 months old and we live in wspace almost all of us can fly and we use them all the time i can fly one too and i use them to gank everything i hate before i suggest fixes lets talk about what the problems are1 theyre good at ganking small ships2 theyre good at ganking big ships3 theyre good at things they really shouldnt be good at siegefleet missions4 theyre cheap and relatively easy to train intoto elaborate1 are frigates so they have high scan resolution for some reason they also are the only ship to have no retargeting delay after decloaking this means that the only thing that can avoid being pointed by a stealth bomber is a prealigned frigate piloted by someone with really fast reflexesin lowsec and wspace using a stealth bomber for initial tackle is uncounterable which is why we use them the no decloak delay is an interesting mechanic on its own but doesnt belong on an otherwise so versatile ship that costs so littlenote i really really really dont want to open the can of worms that is stealth bomber afkcamping in nullsec that is its own problem and while obviously very related still orthogonal to most of the issues presented here its too hard to have a discussion about it and all of the other uses of this extremely versatile ship so lets please leave that out of the discussion2 obviously this is the main role that they were designed for  this is the niche they were supposed to fill my main issue here is that the big stuff youre killing takes longer to train into and costs more than the  i could bring a similarsized ship and therefore similar isksp investment but it makes a lot more sense to just bring a cheap stealth bomber and guarantee landing point even if the prey is dscanningtheyre used to great effect in large numbers in nullsec warfare too i might be alright with a cheap frigate being able to engage battleships im alright with a covops ship being able to engage battleships i might be alright with a ship that can perform other combat roles being able to output battleshiplevel damage yes the sustained dps is only cruiserlevel but theyre killing battleships so im calling it battleshiplevel damage the combination is overwhelming3 even our small corp has used to bash poses siegefleet bashing a pos in by sigtanking the pos guns is weird and not a fun mechanic to have to deal with it doesnt create content it might be cool to have a cheap ship that you could bring to bash poses with that doesnt have the commitment of sieging dreadnoughts but if they can cloak up then thats just no funive used to run faction warfare missions in lowsec this is unfortunately a sticky issue because without  lowsec missions are not worth running at all that is however a completely independent problem that needs to be addressed separately having missions that spawn beacons that anyone can warp to is cool being able to do level 4s with a covops cloak is not its interesting that a cheap ship can solo level 4s in lowsec its downright unfun that they can do it and cloak4 a typical stealth bomber costs 20 million for the hull and 40 million after fittings it takes 32d 20h 54m 40s for a brand new character with no remapimplants to get to the hullcloaktorps and another 2d 2h 58m 40s for the bomb launcher but you dont need that for 1 or 3 the training time is important because you can field a lot more lowsp ships than highsp oneswhen doing 2 or 3 that seems unfair if didnt have their covert ops cloak they would still be good at those and i would still complaini spent the 42d 22h 58m 30s to train into an interdictor and the ship costs more than a stealth bomber we use it to gank things too at the current isksp investment required i would fly a stealth bomber if all it could do was instantly uncounterably is that a word point things its good enough at 1 alone why does it do 2 and 3
fantasyland interludeim not suggesting that this is a good solution but lets imagine an eve where dont existsmall ships are relatively safer from being ganked because you need to bring a noncloaky ship that can be dscanned or a cloaky ship that can only bump you during its decloak delayyou need to bring big expensive ships to fight big expensive shipsyou need to bring battleships or better to siege poses and they cant cloak up and run away if you really dont want to fight you could bring cloaky t3s but thats a slow pos bash and you can always get pointed by some kind of weird covops ship that has no decloak delay and the scan resolution of a frigatelowsec missions would actually be dangerous yes theyd be a waste of time but thats just because the riskreward ratio of those missions is way too high  again a separate problemalso all the sp my corp sunk into would go to waste unless we want to fly covops oh wait we live in wspace or torpedoes ewback to realityok so have a lot of balance problems as a very versatile ship theyre used by a lot of people for a lot of things this is probably not a problem that can be solved by a single changebut wait t3s are really versatile people use them for a lot of things as a wspace corp we use and see a lot of t3s i have a lot of words about them but ill leave them out of this the point is im much more ok with them because theyre really expensive and take a long time to train into also their logistics subsystem sucks which reduces their overpoweredness i know i said i wouldnt bring t3 balance issues into this but its relevant i swearwhat if stealth bomber hulls were 100 million that would make them at least more expensive than the battlecruisers we gank in them that would make them closer to what i think a combined tackledamage role should cost similar specialized tackle ships interdictors and interceptors cost more than or as much as and dont provide damagewhat if they took longer to train into that would be weird because theyre just a t2 frigate but what if you needed t2 torpedoes and t2 bomb launchers to fly them well i actually had to go look up what those modules do because we dont use them they dont fit well on t2 torpedoes deal a little more damage to shield battleships but way worse damage to armor battlecruisers you also lose range javelin is pointless on  t2 torpedoes are just too hard to justify bringing unless youre using them for a siegefleet or something maybe if t1 torpedoes did very poor damage and t2 torpedoes did fantastic damage people would feel the need to train for t2 launcherst2 bomb launchers reduce the cycle time to 135 seconds before skills which is cool if youre in a siegefleet even then the extra fitting cost is hard to bear there are no t2 bombs there are a lot of directions to run with this but my personal favorite is making t1 bombs die to a single t1 bomb explosion t2 bombs would have the hp of current bombs so you could actually do bombing runs in large fleets t1 bombs would only be useful in solosmall gangs keep in mind i live in wspace so large fleet means more than 9increasing the cost of a stealth bomber seems like a fairly lowrisk change making t1 torpedoes worse and t2 torpedoes better would affect battleships but in a good way i think then again i dont use missiles much i dont fly battleships and i dont run highsec missions so maybe i have no idea what im talking about making t1 bombs worse and either introducing t2 bombs or giving the t2 bomb launcher a damage modifier would only affect t3s can be good at a lot of things but not all at once if t3s had a decent logistics defensive subsystem nobody would use logistics ships a stealth bomber can tackle small ships provide damage for big ships and do all this while cloaked since one less role than ccp intended seems to be not too overpowered lets try that on 1 they can tackle small ships and cloak but cant engage big targets that means covops and no decloak delay but no bomb launcher and maybe no torpedoes2 they can cloak and engage big targets but cant tackle small ships that means covops and bomb launcher  torpedoes but a decloak delay3 they can tackle small ships and engage big targets but cant cloak unfortunately in order to instapoint small ships they need the cloak so this doesnt make any senseits hard for me to pick a favorite here because they both hurt our playstyle too muchtldr the phantasm is way better at impaling things than the incursus
theyre not they get obliterated by them ive seen an atron with ion blasters kill a hound it took him way over a minute but with the hound dealing miniscule damage to him with torps he died miserably unless youve got the numbers for it theyre going to maul you horriblytheyre not really killing battleships since they die too fast gokufleet got drivebyd by a bunch of tengus and that was the end of that and interceptor gangs do a hilariously good job harassing siegefleets unless siege has backup recons with scrams webs and ecm theyre good at ganking unwise unsupported battleships whose pilots are bad thougha bc pilot would have to be largely terrible to die to a solo bomber and when you sic a ten of them at it its not a fight anymore its a gangbangplus its supply and demand  they used to be twice as expensive nowadays theyre actually much cheaper
me too but thats not what im talking about please read my explanation where i elaborate on 1or pvefittheres also a price floor based on the cost of production
it may be able to land a point well but in many cases its unreliable to tank long and survive the fight  especially if youre ganking something small by small i assume a frigatecruiser they seem largely hit and miss ive seen them both die to bombers buddies and killing the bomber to leg ittheyre good entry level for covert ops tooedit after some research into the subjectthe scanres i wouldnt call stellar if we compare it on t2 level minmatar as examplehound 500mm basejag 750mm basewolf 700mm basecheetah 450mm basestiletto 970mm basethe covert ships out of the bunch have lowest scanres and cheetah can add to it the decloak penalty raw bombers dont have a decloak delay and can point fast holds a lot of merit to it but its worth noting that people get snatched by arazus rapiers and covert t3s  its likely that most victims of a bomber would fall to one of those equally easilywell take a look at the arazu nonsensorboosted reasonablish skills not all 5sscanres after skills 288mm 231 base  decloak delay sensor booster if someones into this flavor of the razu can bump you up to 460ish after skills 288 is 44s lock time on a raw cruiser preset eft and you need to add to it 6 second decloak delay 5 if you went all snowflake on it and have cloaking 5 but were not talking obscene skillsit composes to 10s time 1 tick rounding up likely for a pilot to react align and warp 12 second reaction time could be common when someone is expecting danger and in this case its worth noting recon pilots often approach targets in cloak going for a bump decloak  to stagger someones warpout and even larger when someone isnt to that you need to add align time of coursethat said after some consideration i can get behind siegefleets price and harassment value but its a tricky subject on its own
it doesnt need to survive the fight right now theyre cheap as  and can hold tackle long enough for friends to get on field with basically no way to stop that from happeningthere will be neither compassion nor mercy nor peace nor solace for those who bear witness to these signs and still do not believe  the scriptures book of reclaiming 2510
im pretty happy with bombers in the place where they are its nonsensical to try and claim that they make other frigate class ships not worthwhile because torps are so utterly different to any weapon other frigate class ships use and observational evidence shows us plenty of frigates doing plenty of things with no worries in the world about bombers treading on their toesim hoping that torps themselves get a rebalance and when they do its likely that bomber bonuses will need to be reworked to compensate but right now bombers are pretty cool imo
malcanis 2014
the only thing i always wondered about when it came to was their range by default it can hit out to around 50km with its torpedoes the range goes beyond lock range with javelin but the damage drops drastically
yea be totally happy with a ship that a cost analysis has shown out performs bs and t3s for grinding sov as far as cost and dps goes can fling wave after wave after wave of bombs with bomb code that frequently goes on the frittz and forgets its supposed to blow up the wrong bomb type and now we have people isboxing groups of bomberssounds perfectly balanced to me let me help if the goon only uses one thing and one thing only to grind sov with theres something broken about it regardless of your opinion
fair comment i should have said that im happy with respect to their torp ability since that was the element of the op that caught my attention my bad for not being clear therei definitely believe that bombing should be dialled back a healthy notch and i have given this feedback to ccp in several discussions revolving around fleet combat
sup bobi got that consignment of attention you said you needed
erm i compared bombers to a lot of things but other frigates was not one my only frigate comment was that it wouldnt make sense to make a t2 frigate hull take longer to train into which is why i proposed the t2 weapon changesmy entire point is that id be fine with if they did some subset of what they do and perhaps costed more but they currently are too versatile and are too cheap of an isksp investmentgreat perhaps you should consider my t2 bombs proposal
what mining really needs is the elimination of static belts ie  they were mined out a long time ago and should never respawn and the introduction of scanning down minable asteroid clusters in each system
your argument is proffered as the only way to look at the argument but let me propose another viewpoint i spend almost all my time in high sec  8 i can try and gank someones snowflake rni but im unlikely to be successful simply owing to gaming mechanics in my chosen region of game play i chose my area of eve to play in and understand and accept the consequences of that choice where you play ganking the exact same snowflake is relative childs play  assumes pure pve fit rni  but your chance of losing implants is much higher this implant issue is a downside of where you have chosen to play the game im suggesting that like me you must accept the negative aspects of your choice to play where you play just as i doalso i put in 5s as soon as possible and your contention that it in someway hinders me wanting to play couldnt be more wrong what you r really saying is it doesnt benefit everyone so it should be removed or altered if this is the new paradigm for eves development then i have a very long list of things you wont be able to do soon because they dont benefit meyawn im right as usual the predictability kinda gets boring really
hello this is my first attempt to raise an issue so lets see where it goes with lack of any input in the fi thread ive decided to move it here there have been a lot of quality of life improvements as of late so i think the developers could spend a few minutes of their time on this issue i mean hey we got new bubble effects you can now precisely determine which sort of bubble you died inproposalat least crank up the blue tint on the covert cynosural field generator i icon making it different from the cynosural field generator i one kind of like warp scrambler and warp disruptor haveand why the balls would you do thatcurrently two modules cynosural field generator i and covert cynosural field generator i share exactly the same icon on the ui its also used as the command processor i icon for some reason their functionality while similar providing a jumpcapable ship with a beacon to jump to differs in major ways for the unaware i will list them cynosural field generator i requires cft cynosural field theory at i covert needs cft5 cynosural field generator i has a cycle time of 10 minutes 5 on a recon covert variant has a cycle time of 60s 30s on a recon cynosural field generator i consumes 250 lo at cft5 50 on a recon covert uses 25 5 on a recon to a normal cynosural field can jumpbridge capital supercapital jump freighter rorqual black ops battleship to a covert cynosural field can jumpbridge only a black ops cynosural field is a beacon that is seen by the entire system and anyone can warp to it covert cynosural field is seen only on the grid its present on both render your ship immobile while cycling and prevent you from ejecting its common that during sov wars recon ships and variants of t3 cruisers carry both cynosural field generators in their high slots  and very often both are online sometimes one is offlined due to fitting requirements or to prevent fatal mistakes this allows for quick response if a scout comes across something caps should be unleashed uponpilot skill at reading labels aside it is excruciatingly dumb that a module that lights a beacon pretty much invisible to others share the icon with one that makes you a target for the whole system  in best case scenario welding you in place for five minutes second best case ten worst case less because youre getting sent home in a pod or via pod expressim fully aware that there may be a ui redesign coming up judging by presentations from the art team but couldnt we at least get a placeholder it would be a big quality of life thing for people addicted to cyno 5 usageas a disclaimer  no i havent actually lost anything to a mislit cyno myself or id link a lossmail for the crowd to laugh at ive seen this little incident happen with comical results as for five minutes nothing warped to the rapier that lit it despite full local i did pack the wrong cyno with me once though  selected the wrong module from hangar was stopped from lighting by insufficient amount of lo in hold
i agree its just like the issue with the abmwds before the change to the mwd icon simple change
