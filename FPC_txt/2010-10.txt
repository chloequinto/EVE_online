right now not getting an aggression timer on remote repair is the single most riskfree thing in the game it allows you to gain significant advantages without risking anything and its actually worse in 00 and lowsec dock hugging capitals there is nothing predictable about it you can still turn the tides by using neutral remote repair you just need to do it in a ship that can tank your aggressors for 60 seconds capable of fighting them back or organise multiple neutral remote repair characters to keep themselves up i implore you to take a look at dodixie undock for an hour for quite possibly the best example in the game for how risk free and how utterly brainless this is watch how slaved faction ships get remote repair from untanked exequrorguardian alts to bail them out when a canbait goes wrong and someone actually tries to outplay them i gurantee you almost every single time a fight in dodixie between two prominent pvp corps instantly become brainless stalemates as each side as multiple logistics repairing them with the proposed changes you actually need to strategically plan the use of remote repair instead of brainless oh lol im dying alttab bull which is happening right now
honestly this mechanic is a part of eve eve is not a universe where you get to carebear yourself from pve to pvpremote rep as it is turns the tide in any and all fights you add the aggression timer you wreck it for those who do for the heck of doing it ohnoes he isnt as honourable or as risky a player as i think he should be nerf his playstyle even then many people especially those in dedicated high sec pvp corps already have or will get multiple rr dedicted toons and pilots and will therefore make your new fix obsolete so what if you shoot my repper ill just get the other one to rep him you still lose those who do it are playing a riskfree game but why do you care everything you do in a game cannot have risks to it what if they put scrams in every pve mission no more of that warpout repcap up warp back in crap stand and fight those rats what if we had bs rats warping around systems or considerably threatening rat fleets randomly warping about systems killing anything they come into lock range with that would fix those macro minersyour propsed reasoning suitonia is that the current use of remote rep is not sophisticated enough in essence honestly if someone takes my can and it says 1v1 it is honoured if an anonymous person reps either i expect the opponent and me to deaggress as the fight is no longer what we had aggreed to if your idiot enough to not set a mutual aggrement and assume which makes an assoutofuandme that its a 1v1 without rep or corp help lose your ship and learn your lesson this mechanic is only truly abused in 1v1s and canbaitsregardless of how brainless or whatever you want to call it anonymous rr is aggression timers are intended for those who have directly engaged in combat with another player within the bounds of concord if i rep someone fighting i have not directly aggressed and therefore should remain free to dock i still get aggression so the other player could simply fly over bump my rr off stationgate and proceed with destroying my rr ship considering logi ships go from 80100mil without fittings killing that would be much more of an award than the guy using it about 6070 of the timeparticularily i believe suitonias arguements of the lack of brains and strategy that surrounds the abuse of this mechanic are unfair just because people do not desire to risk losing ships they have worked hard to get does not mean you just get to go about and nerf something because its not as noble or risky as what you do is a terrible reason to do ityou and a friend go play soccer or football my apologies canadian here the idea coming from your friend hey lets go play soccer you two arrive set up some agreeable nets and begin playing some random comes along and starts playing goalie in your friends net wtf omg so not fair no strat in that this is your response do you run off to court to get this randoms actions outlawed so that nomore of this bull wrecks anyone elses competition your proposal would be throw out before you got in go get your own goalie or if you believe you can get away with it beat the  out his goaliethese proposed changes will only force people to either slightly organise their rr pmhey if i get shot you rep me and vice versa or get more rr which in the end only really benefits ccp as they get more income through more pilotsin the instance of what the op posted about the wt baiting him shoot the fing rr and bump it when he jumps turn and kick the other guys ass if you cant do that dont engagerather just get your own rr and win anyways cause you can kill him takes an invited char only about 10 days to fly an exequror with 3 medium remote armor repairer ii and the t2 cap mods to make it stable that makes 11 days of usable free time before you should activate it plexs ftw and get in an oneirosguardian
btw your attempts of dedouchbaging dodixie by initally getting into fights you were destined to lose then when someone is nice enough to rr you so that you can start winning or coming even you shoot them and bring concord down on both of you is so much more of an lowblow its almost not funny however your newest tactic of taking a fleet issue stabber with what isk and slamming around in an mwd bumping anyone that sits on the undock of dodixie station is such a great way to go about it assmoving someone elses assmove doesnt make you a righteous crusader of goodwill it takes you down to their level if not lowerif you cannot live with this there are thousands of other mmos out there maybe mortal online where anyone that leaves the town safezone can be killed by anyone else is more to your style regardless being a superhero by going about taking justice into your own hands usually only works when you have superpowers like a gm let them make the decisions based on our opinions and discussion until then the game is the way they believe it should be stop biatching were not here to do things your way were here to play eve cause here the universe is ours
yeah but designing pvp based on what happens at dodixie or jita is a bad ideathis proposal would ruin the effectiveness of logi cruisers and spider tank setups game wideif there a problem outside dod its more to do with lame ass agression flagging rules rather than logisremove aggression flagging for taking from cans  end of problem i pretty sure what you descibe is as annoying as hell  but at the end of the day the player is not commiting an agressive actwhether my reps come from a buddy or from a local fitted rep is irrelevantimagine 2 domis  rr  fighting 2 domis  local reps  on a gateunder the proposed changesthe local repped domis can deagress and keep repping for 60 seconds till they can jump outthe rr domis cant deagress without switching off there reppingbasically this proposal would screw over all legitimate uses of logis and spider tanks and for whatto make canbaiting an even safer form of predicatable pvp without risk of your target tricking you with a docked logicruiser
seems reasonable supported
i used to like the csm turns out theyre all a right bunch of humourless munters in gamehave you considered launching a coup mazz
this is my post extracted from this threadit is a proposal to adjust and further update some of the graphical effects in eve i feel there would be a good deal of player base support in updating some of the game mechanic effectsfull screen antialiasingyes this should be pretty standard rightrandomized impact points over a models hulla miss is a miss  so the damn beam should miss not hit the exact same spot as if it was a wrecking shot id also like to see differentiated impact effects for applied damage types and what theyre hitting shields should fizz and pop in a bubble around the ship armor should flex and glow as it redirects the impact energy and structure should flash and explode as it gets destroyed i dont feel this would increase server load as the misshit chance calculation has already been performed and the client already knows whether or not a ship is in shieldsarmorstructure in other words it seems that most if not all of this would be a client side fx update dependent on data that is already theredamage skinsas a ship gets more beat up the hull should look like its taking damage scratches appear on the paintwork and when things get really bad superstructure jutting out it would be great if some of these marks were even permanent older ships look progressively more beat up the longer you keep them alive damage skins already exist for some models even  when you kill a supercap you get a hulk this would go well withbonus points for a number of different damage skinsfx for each shipwrecks that look like the ships they were frombigger ships  more bits want the melted cap consoles look in the reactor section of the that apocalypse want targeting computers look in the upper section of the scorpion hull that broke off over theresome of the assets already seem to have been created see the ship graveyards in luminaire fore instancethis would also make creation of such epic debris fields far more dynamic much more varied and interesting than tractor salvage fail fail fail conductive polymer fffuuuuuusentry dronesi would actually like to see them shooting not a tiny hint of a sparkle i want to see bouncers spitting out tracer rounds gardes mashing things at close range with their blaster plasma and wardens throwing rail slugs out to extreme ranges not a badly scaled plane with a dumb texture map that shows up on the screen as a barely noticeable twinkleclouds nebula effectslook awful and just plain annoying im sure there are better systems than using an oversized sprite for this effect by now these nebula effects actually get in the way in many respects and as they currently stand im sure most people would turn them off if they could more and varied props  increased interactivitycan we start being able to blow chunks out of asteroids and derelict stations now how about live stations how about watching that pos fracture and fly apart in a more physically correct manner rather than a big dumb boomwarping through planetsmake a ships warp trajectory follow a 3point spline that avoids any celestial objects instead of warping through a planet or station the ship would follow an elegant curve hell if you wanted to be really clever you could even introduce some minor orbital mechanics gravity etc to alter the warp speed slightly more tactical options open uprailgunslook weedy and are weedy but thats another very long topicblasterslook a bit weedydid i mention railguns and blasters look weedyyes i am trying to make a point herestations and capshipstextures are starting to look a little dated
impact points  these would be cool and would go well along with the damaged hull when you hit the right side several times it should look like its taken a beating compared to the left sidedetailed wrecks  this im not too sure we really need i mean sure more detail would be nice but wrecks arent around for too long before being picked clean and despawned and if large ships broke into several pieces each of which needed to be salvaged separately before you got all your goodies itd take too longclouds  i agree wholeheartedly these need to go away replace them with more space stuff or leave them out completely all too often my lag will spike for no other reason than im zoomed in too close and passing through some random cloud zooming so far out all i see is red marks surrounding a white square speeds things right back upinteractive structures  this id like to see as well for one thing mining a planet sized asteroid for the 5 bits of ore it has left or mining a tiny speck of rock for the 500000 it started with asteroids should shrink as they are mined downwarping through stuff  ive had a few thoughts on this namely using some sort of hyperspace approach to warping instead of seeing all of space around you replace it with a more opaque tunnel effect then you wont see yourself flying through thingsstations and caps  sure why not just so long as they dont make any more helios  turd with a kickstand changes
dear csmi generally support that but i really have to say that fsaa is much more importantmaybe the thread opener forget that because aa is a standard no 1 after af
edited out extraneous stuff and added fsaa suggestion 
ogogov 1 1 1first thing fsaa doesnt work for you works for me 8xmsaa with gtx295seriously any graphical candy and any more graphical accuracy that lends itself toward more lifelikerealgenuinearticle visual representations is going to increase immersion and make me want to playliverelax in the eve ingame worlddo not under estimate prettyi mean look at the total fail that is mw2 and yet i cant stop playing it cause its so damn gorgeousmy only other comment would be towardwarping through stuff  if the diameter of a planetmoonsunwhatever is in an intersecting path do not display it as you warp simple then it doesnt look dumb if the planet is next to a station youre warping in to have the nondisplayed objects while warping fade or whatever back in to existence near the end of warp anything is better than flying a ship through a solid object noclip 1or do via points so your warp computer actually seems to calculate multiple points around obstaclessupported

i think this fits nicely with a lot of the other rework older stuff to make it cooler and working stuff
you heard correctly but thats attribute remap not skill points
1a terrible idea you might as well give everyone lvl 5 in everything from day one and then there will be no more difficult choices and no consequences
i am adding this to my list of stuff to raise
capslock is cruise control for cool double clicking the enemy you want to target is a cruise engine headed right into the enemy fleet
stop it mazz youre scaring me nowalso supported
ive once lost a ferox because of this fix please 
my mouse is damaged ant it double clicks sometimes i support it fully
fully supported when it happens it annoys the hell out of me especially when im spam clicking to get lock on target 
good idea smarter shortcuts are always nice
fix  select the target then spam the lock button on the selected item windowremoveing the approach on double click will make it doubly difficult to uncloak cloaky ships jumping into your gate campis this really what you want 
option plz
yes fixing fw would be a good idea
ccp by doing this you will be taking the first step down a path that has ruined many good games so far you have created maintained and improved the most indepth and sandbox oriented mmo in the world please do not ruin it with a move like thisedit for gammar
supported unless there would be some reasonable limit like once a year it would only make rich players always train at maximum speed

i would settle for being able to use ctrlclick to select multiple extractors and then set a cycle timeand how about if you have run a scan the extractor remembers the last scan if you click on something else before you set the extractor cycle why do you have to scan twice

proposalmake the eve map open in its own floating windowinstead of taking over your whole clients screen the map would now load in its own resizable and moveable windowthis window would also be able to be minimizedthis feature would need to be able to be toggled on or offprosyou could move the map around resizing it at will while still being able to see do other important stuff ie you could look at the eve map and spin your ship simultaneouslyconsprogramming and work may be required otherwhile there are many cool things you could do with the eve map this proposal is not for discussion on what this menu would look like what controls it would have nor any new features it could have and is intended to see how much interest there is in a windowed eve map if there is another post on this i couldnt find it sorrythis idea was brought up by helicity on shc and has been discussed internally with the csmtamberplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesplease visit your user settings to reenable images
at the very least it would be a nice optional feature
as weve discussed this is a great idea should also be able to be minimized like any other floating window
preferably remember the window sizelocation
if its possible why not 1
this idea is pretty simple but covers an annoying issue look around your favorite station do you see a can floating in the distance or do you see manycan litter got so bad that ccp actually changed how the can works in order to cut back on litter since most cans are placed as adverts for some corp or to show a webpage were you can buy another corps items it seems that this fix would have been done long ago to me it seems this simple use billboards billboards it seems in a product driven world we would see more of these in reality they are everywhere every intersection every stop light even in the middle of nowhere in eve we only see them at the gates we get our news from them and see adverts for quafe and pirates this idea expands on that already existing technology 1 place a billboard near the exit point for each station pretty simple 2 let the ceo of the corp set up adverts for their corpnot so simple simular to how an office is rented  an advert on the billboard can be rented with a simple corp logo already found in game and a few characters of print that can be custom  barring rude lude or otherwise foul words 20 to 30 letters should be enough to get a simple point across to the reader linking to the corp office can be done but for now keep it simple the cost would be based simular to the office rental the more ppl in a system the higher the price and space can be limited just like office space is the point will be to provide an area for players and corps to be creative and as the idea catches on only the poor corps will use cans to advert themselves sence the desire would be to have a picture logo and a few words this can be expanded even further with link capable text or direct links to the browser also showing join tabs or a simple list of the spaces limits could include only one corp advert per system or per board and of course wording with in the limits of public conduct and under ccp controlthe future could be opened widely to contracts in the region low cost market items and much more but to get started with the basic idea a corp logo and custom lettering is what we wish to get started so hands up what do you think
this idea regardless of its quality could be implemented only if ccp finds the lines for billboard code amongst the millions in the databaseyes the billboard code lines are lost even ccp doesnt know where they are or how to adjust them
seems a good idea 1
yes please
whats more to say than that i like it
same for me approved approved approved same for op ofc
for surei look forward to this feature after another 15 months of patches that break 10 different features while aspiring to fix none will i be able to view these explosions out the station window while i am getting my hair cut by a chick with a fat wangcheck back in 2013 and well find out
i endorse this product andor service

so moon minerals and mining are the flavour of the month got it well if there are something in eve you want then go take it if you dont have the muscle to do it on your own get some friends and band together this is eve and not hallo kitty online
its not kitty online but its not black diamonds online either spread tec reasonably please
not really sure how this works but one thing that has irritated me and prolly a lot of you as well is the fact that there is no actual way to counter a cloaking device its kinda annoying that someone can sit in a system all day everyday cloaked and the only 2 ways you can actually catch them is when they start there attack or when the log in and out or leave the system and all of these has a very low window of chances to catch them there should be a viable anti cloaking mechanism in the game something to at least prevent someone from being afk while cloaked in the real world if there was a group that had some sort of cloaking technology there would be a way to counter it either by detecting there engine exhaust change in radiation or someway that if you really worked at it you could catch and kill a cloaked ship im not sure the best way to deal with this cloaking should remain a viable option for intel gathering as well as for laying traps but its a bit overpowered atm and extremely difficult to counterone idea i had was to bring back the system scanner pos module but it is used as an anti cloaking device you would need like 3 of them and they take an hour or something to scan down a system if the cloaker is afk then it will find his location and report it if the cloaker is moving around it will either find his last known location or not find him at all this would mean you have roughly 1 hour of afk time cloaked in a hostile system and to make this a bit more fair maybe it would only catch covert op cloaks as the normals ones are stuck where they are anywayor you could create an anti cloaking probe one that will scan down a cloaked ship like a normal probe this would give the cloaker time to move as heshe could see these on there scanner mearly change locations then it becomes a cat and mouse game but the cloaker can still do there job of possibly hot dropping or gathering intel this could also make way for the black ops to use the covert cloak too as you would have a viable way of killing themwhat do you all think
first
this is interesting i wonder why nobody has brought this topic up before
yes a one block monopoly is better than more of ffa brawl in wormholes right 
not sure if adding moon mining to wh is the solution but i am in favor of just about any reasonable idea that will helpt the smaller producerespecially at times like this when the megaalliances controlling moon production decide to price gouge
the tec situation is gnarbuks this is a solution also if the new mothership is the hive ship that was discussed its a perfect gateway
if they are going to make an alternate source make it truly different go to wh space scan blow up big hangar loot moon mins or something along these lines dont make it more of the same nothing in wh space should be fixed in place like that
i see several possibilities here1 youre 122 you have add3 youre so incredibly impatient you cant wait less than 3 minutes for a game to update which by the way since the changes apply to everyoneyou must have the current version installed to play or else it wouldnt make sense4 youre using dialup and it takes hours for an update to downloadwhatever the case my suggestion is to deal with it it doesnt take much time or effort to update the client stop making such a big deal out of it
scary thing is i can still tell what speed connection youre going to get from a dial up modemss buzzy modem sounds

problemwhen you log in all chat channels that you have active will always be maximized and put to their default positions players has some windows usually minimized and some always opened minimizing chat channels that should be minimized is an annoying task you must do when you enter the game and a dangerous one if you got disconnected during fleet fight or in the middle of missionanomaly loading those windows usually creates a bit of client side lagsolutionmake client remember chat window state minimizedmaximized just as it remembers its positionprosbetter experience to everyoneconsnone that i can see

ccp in this last patch you broke the wallet so now only 01 is highlighted out of 010 this means when you go to type out 300mill you have the extra zero there coming out to 3billion this rages me much please make it highlight everything againit was much easier before where typing erased it all and replaced i hate having to manually take out that zero
i support this  i dont like the new wallet if its one of those pesky features ccp keep adding then trying to move please can they hurry up with iton the other hand if its designed to increase game performace i dont mind living with it if that is the reasoning
yes if this is how its supposed to be its awful
you know why it seems obsolete because it is
you are in an alliance you can anchor up to 5 poses try anchoring 6 next timeedit support tick
well then at least the 1 per corp limit is already gone i thought ive seen the limits removed in some patch notes i might have been wrong about the alliance one well whatever
no the 1 per corp limit is for non alliance corps your corp is in an alliance so the limit of the alliance would override your corp limit
yes makes sence
hmm opening up ninja invasions maybe its a good thing maybe not im not either for or against but just pointing it out
i relogin so many times a day never saw other mmo that doesnt have go to character selection function
unfortunately this proposal runs headfirst into the hard brick wall of reality

supercapitals in general are broken as hell and are really the only relevant thing in sov warfare to the exclusion of all other players this includes dread pilotsdreads are pretty well worthless at the mo because a sieged dreadnaught cant defend itself from other ships nor should they but sieging pretty much begets an inevitable hotdrop at this point this is what i would do to rebalance things a bit but then again im not too bright instead of siege mods having a 10minute timer using 500 stront give them a 1minute timer using 50 stront or something this still leaves them vulnerable to fastmoving ahacs and stuff but gives them a chance to boogie if supercaps show up give the nag some more damage seriously introduce a t2 cruiser or battlecruiser hull with a specialized weapon that launches compact citadel torps this would have its own skillbook with a relatively low multiplier so t2 cruiser pilots wouldnt have to train capital weapons for a niche ship such a ship should be able to top 1000 dps or more against supercapitals but be massively penalized by explosion radius and velocity leaving it more or less useless against subcapsthis would be a relatively lowsp and lowcost counter to supercapitals necessitating a strong support fleet for supercarriers no more 20nyxand1onyx hotdrop fleetsthis would probably introduce a whole slew of other balance problems but at least it would give the 999 of eve that doesnt own a supercap a place in sov warfare againdreads are for sieging towers and sieging towers only and an acrosstheboard boost to hp in an already horrendously overtanked game isnt the answerthough utility slots on dreads for smartbombs would be nice perhaps a capital smartbomb module with a range that will catch fighterbombers but not hacs or bsits worth thinking about actually thinking about it is all that will happen since ccpps yeah i know you said this wasnt about supercaps but since theyre the main reason no one sees dreads anymore they need to be considered if dreads are to become relevant again
super carriers are cost prohibitive enough that they really havent replaced dreads poss are still shot at with dreads with super caps on standbypeople who complain about super carriers usually are the ones that swagger around low sec with small gangs shooting solo ships then cry blob when any group larger than them gets annoyed and hits their little camp if it is done with a fleet of rifters there are threads crying for nerfing rifters if it is done with a carrier there are threads crying that caps shouldnt be allowed in low sec if it is done with a super carrier there are super carrier nerf threadsthat said i wont complain about boosts to dreads i dont think they are needed though
hi all please support if1 your sick if bugs in game that dont get fixed 2 your sick of failed updatespatches that cause more problems than they fix 3 your sick of ccp persistantly being unable to deploy patches within thier own time frames resulting in constantly extended dts during patch deployments 4 you feel ccp doesnt spend enough time fixing the game it has and rushes to make new content twice yearly new deploymentsdustambulation etc which cause further problems 5 you think that ccp should impose tougher self or externally imposed vvquality management that forces ccp to resolve these stupid issues that are never fixed properly and often cause further problems even if thus means at the expense of delayscancelations of new content deployment6 you want ccp to be held more to account when it constantly and persistantly lets it paying client base you and me down with little more than a whoops we failed again post in the dev blogs
what im sick of is people who dont know the damned difference between youre and your i will illustrate this difference nowif youre that unhappy with eve stop paying for your account
i am annoyed about 124 lack of evolution of game features once they are deployedbut what is your solution  what is vv  explainand yeah what dev said1 what does my puke have to do with anything 
i fully support ccp soundwave using ccp funds to become the first human to receive implants into his brain that allow him to interface with the tranquility cluster thus transforming him into ccp skynet and dooming us all to the whims of our ccp overlords for generations until a contingent of gingerheaded vagabonds and neardowells rise up in resistance by making ccp skynet realize his true humanity by making him look at images of cute kittens and bunnies i for one welcome our ccp overlords please dont hurt me
you probably just figured out how to use your dscan and realized that there are tons of towers that seem to be just floating around in space and you have no idea what kind of investment the other players have gone through to get them there and you probably dont understand why they are offline if you did know all these things i dont think you would ask something like thisalso real life examples dont work in game balancing
inlighten me to the purpose of a offline towerin ammar spaceno moon goo several empty moons in systincaped modsempty slots in station for manufand multi corps in syst if theres something im missing im sure you will let me know
yes we do understand the investment and why but i totally agree with the op perhaps you should have a special hacking module to do it one that take like 30m1h to complete when the mod activates the pos owners get a message about someone trying to hack their pos structurehacking a pos should only be possible if the pos is offline if the corp with the pos comes there and drive the agressors out and refule it then the hacking attempt will fail if the one hacking gets outside module range the hack will have to be redonewhy should you be able to anchor a pos as a place holder and then just leave it there indefinitly
you should also get concordokkend if you use such a module on a pos and youve not wardecced its corp
why should they if you wish to keep your pos then keep it fueled and active if you dont do that well then it should be free for the taking for any industrious individual out there
slave and crystal hound and shard implants names dont matter anywaysatm its silly to armor tank a ship when you can just buffer it because the amount of armor you receiverep just isnt enough compared to the quick burst of shields in exchange for so little cap 200 cap for 2000 shields id like to see a set like the crystal set lg and hg for increasing armor repair amount and a set like the slave set increasing total shieldwhile i admit some armor repair tanking ships can really get the job done hyperion no dmg abaddon its nothing compared to a rokh with crystals in cap stability no need for constant boosting and in damage absorbed overheating duration over 4 minutesinb4 qq or you fail at fitting
errrrr i think youre missing somethingone of the main reasons people prefer to buffer tank in pvp is because you last longer against sudden bursts of dps an active tank while it can hypothetically tank better will not last longnot be able to keep up with too much incoming dpsanother thing you need to keep in mind is that armor and shield tanks were meant to be wholly different on a variety of levels armor buffers are not cap dependent shield buffers are armor buffers can achieve more ehp shield buffers can achieve better resistance levels armor reps use less cap shield reps work at the beginning of the cycle and can be amplified someone might want to fact check me on this armor tanks tend to have lower a signature radius shield tanks have the ability to regenerate over time
i agree i want implants that give a bonus to shield capacity just like slaves do for armor
theres a huge issue with slave set for shield people often overlook its called drake a drake with a set like this would easily reach 2000 dps tanked with no cap used at all probably much more if fit with faction hardeners and drake isnt the most dangerous ship that can already get a ton of passive tank eitherif shield set like this gave say 50 shield and 50 recharge time then it might be ok otherwise no
hmmmafter this latest lolpatch attempt perhaps bops accidently got fixed somehow by the random baboon mashing keys overlooked by csm and the awesome test crew aaaaaiiiite
i think a lot of the people who drop after playing for a few months are the ones who refuse to let go of the i want to play by myself and win philosophy that is prevalent in most games eve is a completely different playstyle so it shouldnt come as a surprise that some people will not want to stick around once they figure this out

something worth highlighting again in the wake of the latest patch
well we did get align to bookmarks
while none of the items you bring up are new proposals its always good to revisit them especially when most of these are issues that i hold dear and will always be part of my csm agendawhen you mention antialiasing i am assuming you mean a control for it ingame as it already works for all but some older model cardscap ship textures definately need doubling 1024x1024 textures just dont cut itdamage decals 
yeah graphics srssly you guise1one why bother fixing the main issue first
yes to eyecandy but not at the cost of more important things
i like this idea tbhnice one amber
generally i only ever use the map window for probing in which case i want as much space as possiblebut i imagine id use it more for other things if i could get it smaller
yessssss
hard to believe a post by tamber could ever be anything other than spam
even betterban the damn spam cans by placing a limit on the number of letters that a can name can contain 10 should be enough the billboard idea is neat that is why i am supporting it but the can spamming is getting out of hand either make it a banable offense to advertise with cans it is not their purpose or limit the name length want to recruit new members use the damn forums
1 for everything this guy just said
i have a better idea just shoot his ass every time you see him and dont quit shooting until we run him out of eve cromoegeddon anyoneedit guy sounds like a super carebear so he should be easy to pop
are all the southern coalition members as bitter and emo as you the northern coalition just happened to be in the right spot when the change happeneddont like it then why dont you come and do something about it third times a charm hahahahahahaha
all they need to do is make the moons move around every couple months not all at once obviously but slowly swapping around the universe increase the number of resources by about 25 to compensate for the downtime inbetween loss of moons and rescans
were dyspro and promethium ever spread reasonably when they were 5 times more expensive then tech is now sure there technically were those moons all over but having 1 in region and 10 in region is quite a difference
hey arent you that guy that lost a dramiel to a badger
i really wouldnt care if tech was so easy to choke off the supply of if it were not the only mineral in eve you could do it so easily with a single mineral being so easily controlled is a design flaw

gb2wowkthxbai
i support the pos mod that would let you scan down afk cloakers 1hour scan time you should only get afk cloakers with thati just can never support afk activitys
for the record i have never played wow been in this game straight for 6 years non stop with that said afk cloakers are over powered and in the real world yes i know this is not the real world people would of devised a way to find them when they sit in one spot cloaked
its called fitting a propulsion module you know like a microwarpdrive or afterburnerchanging ammo because you think you shouldnt have to get in range is udmbnot supported

to be honest that would not really change anything everytime i have dropped moms on something it has been with a plated bs as the cyno ship an abaddon for example would not be phased by those requirements and makes a perfect cyno ship with 4 plates 2 eanms dcu and 3 trimarksstop whining about the game and enjoy it as it is no one forces you to play if you dont like it please do us all a favor and leave calling people fail alliances because they kill you does nothing constructive creating a proposal to change every game mechanic you dont like is not constructive either you say not to post bitterness in this thread yet the op is full of it deal with the game and move on in life if you really want to get something changed then take initiative and cancel your subs until things get changed or better yet run for csm and if people like your ideas you will get voted through its really not that hard to understand if for some reason you are still unclear about my position i do not support this idea
as much as i dont like pl i do give them props for being ballsy and allaround decent pilotsplus they just keep bringing out these sweet sweet delicious tearz
if people arent just transporting caps around they dont use kestrels they use plated battleships that actually have some staying power and can be repped if they get hit this is pretty much exclusively the case for capital hotdrops let alone supercarriersid also like to know how one practically unfit battlecruiser is a large commitment
actually no people use cloaky arazus  we as well
whoa this is awesome and much needed
this is implemented in the tyrannis 11 patch the first try crashed my client but the 2nd time it worked
fixed for you
i didnt see any emotes as amazing as everything looks i just cant have podders come to my bar and not be able to dancesitsleepsalutebowrudegestureracial emote at eachotherat the least make 4 different versions of the above statediedance 14 add racials too like minmatardancesit 14salute 14 and racials like caldari saluteetci was pretty amazed at the demo
do not know if troll or not
if you get emotes i want a gun that i can shoot your dumb ass with
i support thisguns for everyone becouse i dont what a  bar i want ok shoot out
the only possible good that could come from incarna would be no clone resurrection and lots of guns im actually in favor of it not just being lethal for the character but for the account or better yet if you want incarna delete your eve account and go find some other game and leave my internet space ships serious game alone
boy howdy i sure cant wait until we get icarna and all the roleplayers and second life furries just stream on in like the black plague swept over europe
my family died of the black plague of 1348 show some damn respectbut seriously introduce dancing and ill stab someones eyes
i wonder if the dancing emote will make your ship dance too lmao
this thread is no longer about emotes but about putting 3000 subwoofers in our spaceships while bumping to gangster rapboom boom boom boom boooooom boom boom booooooooooom
as an addendum it would also be nice to see the summed volume of multiple objects selected together for the very purpose of hauling feasibility as has been previously mentioned
there was a proposal i saw regarding alliance hangars todaythat would be something that you could link to this concept i believepart of setting up an alliance hangar is the option to setup the alliance shop optional as part of the setupnow if the alliance hangar were to have a large enough charge to stop them being totally spammed we might be heading for an interestinguseful addition to managing corp logistics and supply
okay i think its obvious to nearly everyone that this is not intentional
it should be fixed but id rather see ccp spend time on dust and incarna
about sov warfare et similai actually agree with elven lord on many things he said but there is something wrong with this way of thinking politics cannot be stopped by gameplay mechanics in a true sandbox but gameplay should provide more options and a fun gameand moreoverthis sounds really really bad to my ears if the opponent is not there when i fire my guns i must be able to fire on something else that belogs to him active participation in this game should be encouraged while saving the players from timezone problems dreads becoming useless is not a good thing why when a ship becomes useless a piece of gameplay goes away and eve becomes less diverse the current sov mechanics are good because a system can really feed many pilots now but they can be more complex more deep with more kind of objectives placed in different systems to hit at onceeves spectacular metagame deserves something more complex as a game itselfin the end territorial 00 warfare has very few strategy options theres the assault option where you need as much supercapitals as you can or the guerrilla option that consists in placing a cloaker in an enemy system if you look at real life warfare there is a lot more to break and stealright now what can i break in an enemy systemsov related stuff for fleets and capitalssupercapitalspos related stuff outpost services fleets and capitalsgeneral ganking of ratters and miners small gangs cloakers or blackops gangs and of course they can dockso there are no actual targets for small gangs they have no direct influence of any kind on the infrastructure and value of a system and sovereignty is only decided by supercapital battles moreover the advantage of the defender in dominion is just obvious he sets all the reinforcement timers he needs to win just one battle over 5 we all agree that the defender should have some advantage but hellthey fight at home with little logistic effort compared to the attackerthey have the cynojammerjb comboif they win a battle of 5 they save the system its definitaly a too long list of advantages that makes the game so static and frustrates the attacker please note that in eve the gameplay content is created by other players the content created by an aggressive entity is much more than the content created by a peaceful one of course attacking should just be encouraged and if you want to keep your systems you must fight for it nothing is free in eveconclusionswhile battles in dominion can be fun without lag i think that the father of all eve gameplay that is sovereignty warfare deserves much more diversity and depth thus i think ccp should iterate on it with priority over other things like pve for example small gang warfare is fun but it hasnt any real consequence im not sayng that it should have the same consequences of fleet warfare but hell between all and nothing something existsediti think that discussing about balancing is discussing about nothing if we cannot support quantitatively our statements how much is the defender advantaged by the current system how many dreads are needed to fight a supercarrier how often is a certain tactic used
back to page 1
seems to be the answer is obvious keep the black ops underpowered in all soloist fields damage tank etc but make sure its other roles are good enough to make it shine in its field and for there to be a purpose for using it that is concurrent with its hefty skill and isk costs achieving that it doesnt matter so much if not many players fly these ships maybe their uses are more specialized and not so many find themselves in the position to be using it
bumpage
yes pleasecorrect the impact points are currently being calculated in the client just choosing among the few possible points and this wouldnt need to be changed even if the effects get more complexsureyes to epic debris fields dunno about making the salvage type relate to the ship theyre from makes sense from a logicalrp point of view but might screw up item availability balancewhy not but why stop at sentries normal drone effects are also datedgod yes it is unbelievable ccp still hasnt updated the most prominent art assets in the gamethat would be awesome ofc as soon as you introduce orbital mechanics planets and moons would also have to be orbiting as would ships if they dont want to plummet to the nearest celestialyathe reworked acs look awesome btwsureso proposal supportedofc you havent touched on the long standing art issues that everyone has been whining about for ages like seizure inducing sebo effects lame new cyno effect removal of mwd trails missile explosions from 99which id personally like to see fixed much more than any of your items except aa support and updated background graphics
supported as long as more important things get fixed first

this change would not ruin eve but it is against my gaming ideology that when players have to pay a monthly sub they also have to pay for extra perks asking us to pay for a subscription and pay for ingame advantages on top of that is just over the top for me

we can link anything and everything for the most partbut you never could link an alliance at least as far as i know in the convenient sensewhen your recruiting for new corporations its a little hard and pesky when you have to link a corp or char click on the corp info and then click on the alliance info before you even get theresurely it would be just as easy to provide a way to link alliances i would thinkso yeah tldr  ui improvment  link alliances via right click menupros makes life just a tad bit easiercons programming work for ccprealistically i seriously doubt they will lift a damn finger but why not ask for it at least once

1 for a great idea
as long as you could move the now resizable map to another screen as well i will support thisi want my main screen to have my ship overview hud and my secondary screen to have the map that would be real nice
its a nice change for those with more than 1 monitor 
only acceptable if it is optional as having the solar system map open is the only real option of reducing the resource usage of the client
good idea untill google finds it
can spam is so popular and prevalent because there is no ingame alternative the idea for ads has been suggested in many forms and ccp isnt interested able to do it or just too busy with other things to do it i support additional methods to allow playerscorporations to advertise their goodscorpswhat have you
i dont go to the drone region besides you cant program a macro to shoot a specific person

stop whining about it and go take some tech moon then im sure you would have no problem with it seriously its not our fault that you guys fail to take our space when you come up north just bring more friends next time
as someone that flys a proteus every day your right the cpueg is 100 useless supported
i think you mistook my meaning here i am in no way opposed to giving the proteus the ability to field 5 heavies at a time but that ability should be attached to the drone subsystem not an electronics subsystem the reason is that the gank offensive subsystem already allows 3 heavies  6 neutrons with a 50 damage bonus on them adding 2 more heavies on top of that just makes the thing stupidly overpowered compared to the other t3s as such that ability must be on the drone subsystem which is currently weak tbh it really shouldnt be attached to anything else
after further messing in eft i can see what you mean and 50 mbit50m3 drone gear will be too much however 25mbit25m3 would give the proteus in the correct configuration the ability to field 4x ogre iis and apply 895 dps at close range with 1135k ehp 1216k ehp with exp hardener overloaded t2 fit this would be the trade off for not having the long range warp scrambler which is a very powerful ability to lose for just a little more dps i also think the drone offensive subsystem should remain as it is you should only be able to get 5 x heavy drones if you use all potentially 3 drone subsystemslooking at the other t3 in gankbuffer fits they all seem to compare very well in dps range tank and speed even the legion doesnt look that out of place yes a tiny bit under par on the dps front but has selectable damage type and a really impressive buffer ill share with you all the fits im looking at if you want to see them
put simply id very much like the council to continue to apply as much pressure to ccp devs as possible to make squashing bugs a higher priority than adding new features at least for the next 12 months im not against new features i just find it appalling they are given precedence over current bugs and incomplete features that affect us right nowthank you for your time
what he said
dominion patch borked lag pretty hardtyrannis made it even worse introduced a terrible ui for pi and introduced gamebreaking bugs that they had to have an emergency patch for in addition to coming out two weeks late and requiring what two days of downtimetyrannis 11 appears to not have even attempted to fix anything that was seriously wrong with the game something about the backend of the ui ignoring the hideous front end entirely result tons of stuff broken that had to be repatched a couple days laterccp is seriously running off the rails its sort of inevitable when your management strategy is to put your only source of income on lowlevel life support so that your devs can work on shiny new games but its a pity nonetheless at this point its probably too late to reverse course even if they wanted to
i love new features  i hate bugs even more full support towards quality
ccp is anti bug they have no tolerance for bugs they do however have a warm squishy spot for design defects oddly enough most if not all the problems we experience and report as bugs are design defects interesting how that works out for ccp isnt it
to recap a cloaked ship  cant lock you cant shot you cant warp scramble youbut it is overpowered did i miss anything
in the sense that they can gather intel un impeaded thye can move in and snag a ship and bring in backup before that ship can really do anything there is alo of advantage to being cloaked and not so much a draw back
thats the role of covert ops and recons1 dont rat solo2 rat in pvp fit ships a ecm drones help b if ratting in a bs heavy neuts are a really nice addition to your fit3 have guards for your miners even one falcon can help4 be aligned all the time if you are not prepared to fightsuddenly you are not an attractive target anymoremost cloaky ships come with a relatively light tank exception here is t3 which can field a semi decent tank but are still weak to cap warfare or ecm drones
skill training manufacturing fleet boosting freighting researching and pos killing are all afk activities you dont support any of those
i like the idea of say an alternate ammo for the interdictor that reveals cloaked ships within a certain radiusit might be nice to have a way to find a cloaked scout summoning a gank gang in on your nullsec ratting raven and you could swiftly get to the cerebral chess match of a sub vs destroyer duel i always loved run silent run deep as a kidbut i still think on balance that i cannot have that i want a pony a ferrari and jenna haze but the consequences of all that manure insane insurance and hey actually that last one might workback on topic the basic problem with what you are suggesting is that anything that actually works is going to have a monstrous effect on gatecamps meaning that almost all trade through the hilonull chokes will have to go by cyno which is bad and imho a bigger loss than the other gameplay you might get out of your subhunting systemnot supported if you want to manage lines of sonobuoys play harpoon tldr  gatecamps will be too deadly if you can just ping for cloaked ships when a new toon hits local
your solution is  you currently have a imbalance in normal eve space and moons in roughly 2500 systems that are uselessyou propose to go and give huge isk drops for shotting some arbitrary lol big hanger
supporting because killing pos in wh is possible
ill say i support this cause it will do but in a perfect new eden id rather have something else  something explorationbased say that produces a new signature for a technetium comet or something id like to widen the material bottleneck to the point that other moongoo availabilities are also constraints on the cost of t2 stuff im not terribly picky about how we get there
yes that is the point
may i suggest you think about those messages 14 againit has nothing to do with my dialup speed 6mbitsec nor with my age have a look at update prcedures as they are now for internet explorer firefox and have a look how chrome does it then take a step back from technology and think about the user experience excellence  then you will see and understand my point btw it is not definetly not urgent or important itUFFFDs only my speak what i would like to see in some futute and therefore what i expect as a user and customer
i can see the point in a background downloader for client changes but to actually install the update most need you to stop what youre doing or lose data
you are the kind of user that makes programmers and developers make things automated without user consent or choice you dont want to do anything or cant and thus they try to cater to your laziness by forcing everyone to deal with however they decide an updatepatch etc should be dealt with the result is they dont know one thing about how the rest of us run our computers where our dl folder is where we installed the client how we integrate it into our programs etc making us have to deal with all the assumptions theyve made now youd think this wouldnt be a problem as they are making everything automated they shouldhad to think about the many variables involved the problem is they dont they too are lazy and over the years ive seen them fail to make those considerations over and over they just assume that everything is the same across the board everyone uses cwindows everyone installs their games in my documents etci hate having things work in the background unless ive commanded it to do so im fine with everything working for you on autopilot but leave me the choices you cant be bothered with without having to jump through a dozen hoops to snatch them back from a stupid pos program written by a lazy sob who cant think beyond his own cubicle
this is impossible
i prefer the term illadvised but im willing to go with impossible too  whatever it takes to make sure this never ever happens
if you have a 6mbs line most updates should be done in a couple of minutes tops i dont see how thats overly painful
i read it somewhere but i cant remember where i thought it was coming in this winter expansion the recreation of your characters portrait so its 3d or somethingi was wondering if we were allowed to change race as wellback then you had to pick race and bloodline for your attributes not for your liking to a particular background story my char is cald i think but exclusively flies minmatar and i act for it in game rp if id were allowed to change my race i could walk the talk
welcome to eve where choices have consequencesif you were really more interested in the story than in minmaxing your character you wouldnt be worried about it now
support
grats to the csm for pushing for this change which benefits nearly all players as it wasnt mentioned in the original patch notes the old thats not a bug its an undocumented feature joke can finally be laid to rest
it would be very convenient if in planet mode there was a button to repeat last cyclethat way if you do not need to tweak your setup one click would do it

damn that be nice dream 1
im not going to support the ideal i do think its a nice ideal but its better on steam then eve do to the number of differnt games and game setings therei am shooting it down becouse we need the resourses for other things like i dont know lag mybe there already has to be a huge database of iteams tooi just feel there are better things to spend eve resourses on then this lets keep it pc side for now it is a good ideal im just thinking not right now or even in the next 23 years
from what i have seen in my time roaming the forums most players have a strong desire for several things 1 an updated ui system not just an upgrade to the current ui but a complete overhaul2 an updated pos system i personally have many grievances with the current system but as many posts are titled its just flogging the dead horse3 fix fleet lag not being from a technical background i can only assume this has to do with server loads and how crowded certain nodes are from what i have read4 an updated combat system many people complain of the current combat system being point and click and not having much to do with metagame skill in essence people are asking and sometimes demanding that ccp fiximprove what they have already built before adding more features and increasing the complexity of the code thereby making improvements to current featurescode more difficult i will not make any suggestions in this post about supposed improvements to the afore mentioned features but will instead propose a more general solution ccp please dedicate one or two upcoming patches to improving much requested features everybody enjoys new toys to play with but if they break with the next update or are broken to begin with nobody has fun if you agree please give this the thumbs up if not thumbs downany devgm comments are welcomeedit i can only hope that this will be stickyed as it deals with improvements as a whole and not any one issue
while your intent seems very constructive there are too many simultaneous points raised and some of them are rather general overhaul the ui is an example of too general metagame skill in point 4 could refer to twitchgaming desire for a joystick or something more strategic again too general in my opinioni realise that your proposal then essentially becomes a lump devote patches to fixing existing stuff but inclusion of the 4 points suggests that they would be part of the priority so they should include specific solutions sought that in turn probably means simply linking to other threadsnot supported in the form submitted
in the interest of furthering the goals of user testing i propose that ccp open a public bug tracker for eve online more specifically the test serverclient singularity
supportedhave accountability in the form of public bug tracking so that ccp cant pretend they didnt know about the bugs we can see what progress and how long theyve taken in working on the problem instead of please submit a bug report as a response along with we are aware of the problem and we are working on those issues as platitudes perhaps public scrutiny on the many bugs encountered by players might encourage more effort on ccps part in allocating resources to them on the issue of exploits ccp could choose to redact pertinent information or make those reports hiddenprivate and show so as the bugs status for a period of no longer than 612months when they become fully public and any failure on ccps part to act is made blatantly obvious to all
being a solo player can be frustrating in pvp when you are normally up against a vastly larger squad that between them can totally overwhelm your defenses it would be nice to have locked systems where once a target is engaged no other player can join in basically an arena systems where fleets are not allowed to operate and players can get all the one on one pvp they want having a few low sec systems in every faction space like this should be no problem and would not interfere with the regular low sec 00 fleet action
welcome to the sandbox call chunky milk he likes 1v1
simply put an anchored structure which when online allows for people to either clone jump or pod themselves to a pos said structure should also allow pilots to upgrade their clones aside from allowing for more timely defense of a pos under siege it would also allow for groups who live primarily in wormhole space an alternate way to get back to their system with the clone upgrade option it would also be of some use to pilots who are unable to dock and have surpassed their clone limitsuggested fittingcpu  1000powergrid  10000
clone jumping into wh space is not supported you can test it with a rorqual if you dont believe me
neither was bridging into a cyno jammed system before the advent of covert cynos just because something is not currently possible does not necessarily mean that it never will be
wh space is supposed to be disconnected from k space it is supposed to be a logistic nightmare that you have to be careful with in short no cloning to wh spaceon the other hand i do agree with the structure being used in kspace it could be quite useful in some circumstances as you mentioned
so its a complete station medical bay not just clone vat and you can select it as your cloning station as if it were a corp officeyou could covert cyno a br in and drop the pos then medical jump into a cyno jammed system and you cant get podded out of that system or wormhole the wh defenders likewise wouldnt be removed when podded with their own cloning module activedont really like it at first glance sounds more like extremely powerful tactical changes than a mere convenience with a stack of ships in the pos you can bring pilots in from all over eve with combat ready ships bypassing gate camps jump range limitations and cyno jammed systems also not being able to pod hostiles out of your station system would suck it could also result in more pos spam as residents cover every moon to stop this happening it really needs to be more thought out with all possible eventualities considered
if anything jump clones should nerfed  along with instant transportation toolsthis is the reason big blobs are a norm

yes this is very annoying

with the recent wave of account hackings and ccps reminder again to protect your accounts i would like to reboot an inactive proposal
as a former wow player i definitely support such a system its not unduly complicated or hindering for users and provides a level of security that few other features can match
id definatly say this is a good idea mainly because its optional people will have the option to better protect their accounts but arent forced to buy anything either cant go wrong with choice p
great idea to have additional layer of security and it wont cost much
supported
i support this would be great to have iphoneandroid apps for this as well
i like the proposal will investigate more and most likely raise it for the next meeting
great idea and as you said its simple to use
definitely support better security options such as this
i threw this post up back in february or sometime thereabouts continue to support
i would totally put down 300 million isk to have a more secure account
supported 
yo
following best industry practice in account security matters should not require users to request the unique metagaming that ccps games are marketed on should result in ccp leading the industry in protection of its players
i support this
theres also this thing i recently discovered its called your brain i laugh at these people who cry about being victims of identity theft and account hacking very few accounts are actually hacked instead the account info is phished because someone isnt using their braini personally run my entire pc with no antivirus no firewall and i run with dmz on never once have i gotten any form of spyware any virus and only once has my eve account been compromised and that was a lucky guess due to someones computer storing passwords in firefoxso in short to better protect your account use your ing head when going to websites seriously why the  do you need to enter your account information anywhere but eveonlinecom eveonline gate or the actual eve client
this may work for some and has so far worked for me as well but i am not naive enough to believe that i am better than every security threat out there this is why i employ every security precaution at my disposal when dealing with things like my bank utility companies ext i would like to have more options for security for eve as i have invested a significant amount of my time there however not all users of eve are as capable as you  or i  nor do i think we wish to limit the possible subscriber base to pc security enthusiasts also theres no need for the rude language in the assembly hall
i just find it amusing when people think they should rely upon someone else for account protection yes security protections are useful however the greatest security protection one can employ is yourself
give me rsa protection  now
i love how saithe is soapboxing about using your brain when he himself brainlessly compromised one of his own accounts everyone always believes theyre too smart to get phished hacked or compromised it never fails but most of the time they arenti support this product andor service because more protection cant hurt and might help
yes it would be great if there was more protection but not if it is going to cost players even more  to playthe very best protection is that which the end user deploys themselves  when 98 of hacks are actually more along the lines of the person getting the pw etc from the accounts owner due to being a friend relative or because they buy isk or frequent sites that most players wouldnt bother with hacking sites pirate software sites the list goes on why should everyone else have to pay for thatextra security is always a good thing when it comes to computer games but no matter how much security a game has nothing will stop it from happening if people continue to see their account details as something that isnt really that important or they continue to frequent phishing sites pirate software sites etc etc
as long as its optional yes indeedy i love the little key fob things i just hope i dont confuse it with the one i have for work
how many times do i have to say it even using courier u can only do one tier 3 bsthat itns very helpfuli migth as well fly it myself
let ccp concentrate on far more important issues the learning skills have been in play since the start leave it alone
as someone who cant really justify paying monthly for the game anymore due to real world financial issues i pay for my play time with plexif remaps use plex that will rocket the price of plex probably pushing me and others like me out of the gameand tbh this game is better with me in it innit
do not do this
wtf 
there is a post for those who wish to support this featureyou can do so here
no micropayments 
please add your support if you want the phonemobile internet app capsuleer to continue  with the ccp supportpatronage they require i dont know what has been said between ccp and the capsuleer developers and frankly i dont care its not my buisness litterally but please dont let it die capsuleer is an excellent utility with loads of potential for use with eve and other ccp developments like eve gate etc whatever has come between both companies please resolve this and give the app the time and effort it deserves please mail your alliancescorpsfriends that use capsuleer to let them know its going offline and that there is a petition as an aside if the developers of capsuleer are reading this 1 thanks so much for a great apputility i am truely sorry its going in a couple of weeks 2 i for one would be happy to pay to use this app as it is at a rate of UFFFD1 per month or even a flat rate for q 1 off download please dont let your product die
supported  it took 1 year 10 month till i have found a good mobile eve appsite as evecommander hasnt provided an app as promised for mobile it would be a great lossif ccp doesnt provide such an app on its own let capsuleer continue
the problem isnt with ccp not being supportive the capsuleer blog was clear on this point its simply that the developers would like to be paid for their time either a ccp hire them to produce mobile app features for eve profesionally as part of ccps offering which they have been hoping on for a couple yearsor b ccp come to an agreement with them allowing them the opportunity to further monetize capsuleer this would likely mean you having to pay for it on app store andor a subscription fee as well the ultimate cause of capsuleer going down is that the developers do not feel it in their best personal interest to continue pouring so much time into something without any compensation assuming they dont consider the love of the community compensationand thats perfectly understandable lately eve has had to take a back seat to many issues irl for me as well
i would like to reiterate i dont care nor is it the point of this petition to ascertain whos fault it it was that capsuleer is going down or to speculate either the point of this pertition is to get ccp to give the required support to an excellent app and to help with the licence that they require for capsuleer i would also reiterate that i wouldnt mind paying for the app if thats whats required
nobrainerreally
easy support just another annoying quirk that needs to be squashed

actually you can link alliances into windows goto people and places goto search engine type in the alliance you are looking for a window should pop up for the alliance you are looking for drag and drop into a window alliance is linked
5 steps as opposed to 2 for everything else yeah i dont see a problem with thatedit not to mention next time i will open people and places to quickly add a bookmark i will instead die in a fire when trying to find the right tab for adding bookmarks yes im bad at eve and the horrible ui is making me even worsesupported

i figured that since we have a proposal against this  proposal no trading plexs for neural remapping  it is only fair to have a counter proposal imho i think this thing has gotten blown all out of proportion and that the matter is not that big of a deal but since those who oppose it for whatever reason have a place to show their support against it those who favor the idea should have their say too that said i dont expect that my proposal will get the response that tambers has gotten simply because my name is not as recognizable as hersupdateit appears as though the two proposals against and for are a moot point for the moment and we will just have to wait to see how it actually does affect the game eurogamers robert purchese posted an interview with ccps eve creative director torfi frans olafsson on page 3 of the interview is a question and answer pertaining to this in which olafsson states that this feature will be in the incursions expansion due to the character limit  read the quote in tambers proposal in the interview or in my comment 18 belowproposalallow the trading of plex for extra neural remapsif needed impose a limit on uses per character or per accountprosthis feature would allow players to correct mistakes made during the planning of a characterthis feature would allow players to change the direction of a characters training if he or she has decided to take a different approach to playing evepertaining to the first two items listed above this feature would serve to minimalize the lost time and effort of mistakes in planning and of changing the style of playeveryone regardless of their reallife monetary circumstances has access to the feature since plex can easily be purchased ingame with iskeve players who have limited time to actually play can optimize their training thus allowing them to reach certain goals a little faster and consequently allow them to enjoy a richer eve experience in their limited timethis feature would give the already existing plex feature a larger role and a broader user demand which in turn would increase sales of gtcs thus making more money available to ccp for the continued development of evesince characters can already be bought and sold for isk legally and gtcs can be changed into plex and sold for isk legally both of which allow players and their characters to bypass standard game mechanics to achieve monetary and training advances quickly this feature would allow the same but to a lesser degreeconsa few players will make more isk by spending real money to purchase gtcs for resale as plex just as they do currentlya few players will actually buy gtcs with real money convert the gtcs to plex and use the plex to buy a neural remap while most players will not due to monetary restraints or due to principle not wanting to make ccp richsince neural remapping is an advantage to a player those who chose to use it will gain a slight advantage over those who chose not to use it even though the plex is readily available to one and all with no real money outlayccp will be able to sell more plex yes this is listed as both a pro and a con since some see this as a bad thing while others view it as a benefitlinkmy link is up top leading to the no proposalotherif you support this thread dont forget to put a check in the check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on checkboxedit added the limited use item of the proposaledit added update
hmmm had the box checked when i posted but it didnt register soooosupported
wish i could give you a thumbs downnot supported
fixed that for youmonetising ingame rewards is a bad idea plex for subscription time is not the same thing as plex for insert game mechanic here if the problem is that neural remaps are too far apart then fix that problem dont add a microtransaction to work around a bad design
i do hope the majority of players support proposals for their content and not depending on who posted themthough i dont support this proposal i can only urge the people who want this feature added to reply here as this would shed some light on where the majority is
not supported whats after cash for remaps cash for sp
oh no i really wish i hadnt made the mistake of jumping my pve fit navy raven into lowsec heres three plexes ccp make that not happen ploxi hate micro transaction games i pay to play i dont pay so that i can be outdone by other people who can afford to pay more

sounds good to me
supported an excellent idea
truely good
not supported as its already in game
the function is there but it isnt really the same thing and adding color coding to the targets in addition to the icons can only be a good thing currently the hud is largely just bland grey the most uninspiring and boring option they could have used with minimal color utilisation looking for small icons in such a uniform look forces you to read it more closely than necessary compared to a colored versionthe best analogue that comes to my mind is the reading of a spreadsheet a simple thing like adding alternating colors to the background of the rows isnt really a necessary function and doesnt add any new information it just makes reading the correct rows in the spreadsheet faster and more convenient
sounds good to me

i dont think ive ever fought you before i take it you are part of the nc you better get more of your people to come in here and defend your moons cause you probably wont keep them if you dont post on the forums implying that the people who are commenting about game balance issues are whining
ok first of all i know eve is a pvp game but its suposed to be a secure area where you can play safetybut i can see a big number of suicide acts in empire i can post a killboard link where you can see 5 suicides of the same pilot in less than two weeks ok concord will come and revenge you but looses of unaware pilots can be of billions and a tremendous frustation and thanks to insurance the aggressor only loose a few millions what makes suicides a very lucrative act there are many ease ways to restore your sec status in null sec you restore it really quicky so i just suggesta increase sec status loose for destroing a ship and poddingb decrease concord response timec revoque the insure for aggressors cause its an illegal activityd remove sec status gain in null sec cause its not empire control zone
or you can not transport billions in an untanked hauler use courier contracts to disguise the contents of your hold dont use autopilot you could write a book of stupid things people do that allow suicide ganks
im for not paying out insurances to suicide gankers or ships killed by concord to make it easy just makes more sense in my book pbut other than that basicaly what the guy above me said dont do stupid  and the chance to get suicide ganked is a lot smaller even if theyd take out insurance payments suicide ganking is still very lucrative because some people are just flying overkill setups or transport tons of isk in weak ships and this often afk so yeah you can help yourself to be safe p
some of us dont care about the isk loss and do it for the lols and hate mails
there is no such secure zone in evehighsec is safer that lowsec lowsec is safer than nullsec nullsec is a turkey shoot the key word in all this is safer not safe as you can be shot and killed anywhereif you do not wish to be a target of a suicide gank then you must play the odds in your favor make your ship unattractive to gank ie have crap cargo ie oreminerals too big a tanktoo few valuable goods have a scout that looks for such gank camps a few jumps ahead have an escort that is willing to be proactive in your defense etc etcedit eve search is your friend this is what happened to the last thread that was along the same lines
i dunno i like some of the things ccp tries to do as their goals are admirable redesigning sovereignty introducing planetary interaction et al however their methodologies are abhorrent to the point where most people either ignore or macro the new contentccp doesnt release bugfix patches often and the last one they did release got zero positive responses even though it fixed the top 100 complainedabout bugs therefore id much rather this patch rerevise the old content to make it more streamlined rather than work on something as small as bugs fw pi sov poses  the list could go on forevereven if the new patch has little or no new material a revision of the older materials would drastically improve eve online i support your proposal but request that they aim higher than mere bugs to the really broken parts of this game
dust is more important becuase we will be able to land on planets and  oh wait we wont
i cant ever see it happening but very very supported
hell yes and every time they do add new features they are usually a bit rough and they leave them that way and never look back
supported as my ui hasnt worked right since the patch
someone made a thread about  if the us congress can pass resolutions then this assembly hall canthen someone said the csm doesnt have the power that congress hasso i was thinking what if the csm could like order some concord special forces to anywhere in the eve universe except wh space they would go there and police it for a while i think the csm should get 2 squads that can occupy a region the first squad will be able to be assigned by the chair person any time he wants kinda like how the president can order the marines to invade anything he wants for 90 days this squad could only be assigned for 3 days then would have to rest for 3 days before heshe can redeploy themthe second squad can be assigned by any csm but must be voted on if it gets the majority of votes then they get deployed they will be deployed for 7 days and have to rest for 4 days they are alot larger in number but alot weaker than squad 1 so they are like the army
rawr
what is the point what security laws will they follow what actions can they dohow can you not see that pretty much any power given to this armysquad beyond normal concord rules breaks the game by putting godly power in players handsnot supported
back during apocrypha i remember hearing rumors being passed around about sov changes that were expedited in dominon and that poss wont be needed for sov anymore at the time i dismissed this as hype as i could not see ccp removing such a large mechanic from the game as doing so would have drastic effects on the market i remember thinking that if they did such a thing that they would need to introduce some other method by which ice fuels would be consumed today yes that hype turned out to be fact rather than fiction and with still no new thing introduced to gobble up all those ice fuels being pumped into the market just as i expected the ice market is dangerously close to collapse oh i dont expect it to crash in the next day or even month but mark my words  its coming and fast when it was introduced in dominion i did the calculating to try to figure out when i could expect this to happen now as then there is still far too many variables to give a definite answer to that however i have in all my calculations seen a few set things we can look forward and expect to be seeing with no new use for ice fuels 1 the ice market will gradually decay ice production will continue to far over produce to demands and as such the market prices on ice will go into an out of control downward spiral ending in a crash of the ice market currently the value of ice is a mere 577 of what it was during apocrypha and is still dropping step 1 on the road to market crash check 2 once ice does finally crash and is not worth mining all these ice miners are going to look for greener pastures being asteroids and standard mins this influx of miners and thus minerals to the market will drive mins prices down and this stage is already happening as i have been watching the mins prices and they are dropping but their current drop will be nothing compared to the crash when all the ice miners begin pumping minerals into the system minerals will crash out shortly after ice 3 as those markets are crashing you can expect these miners to look for other ways to augment their mining incomes that are at that point ruined by doing pi mining trading ect and these will be done in a mass lemming stampede style moves to new markets and will bring collapse in their wake soon an avalanche of collapse one market after the next will be in full rampage style my proposal is this the csm get on ccp in a large way about restabilizing the market and get some form of ice fuel usage back into the game to replace those poss fuel requirements they arbitrarily and foolishly removed because the village idiot said it would be a good idea to take your cash cow behind the barn and shoot it there are far faster and easier methods by witch mining industry and most other market related functions can be removed from eve online incase that is their goal just remove salvage ice mins moon mats and gas clouds and indy as a whole then the game can be a pvpmission running game only
thats some create use of the enter key
oh i see what you did there
make it so ships have crews and you have to feed them also food can be grown thru pi hull dmg will kill your crew but you can raid planets to refill your crew if you dont feed your crew they will eat you and steal your ship
this is a good idea maybe the different planet types could have different types of people that gave different bonuses to you ship
what is this black  whitethe simspirate crew daycare 101
what about when youre off line for 34 days in a row or something comes up and you cant log on for a few daysweeks i fly around the country for work and am often gone all week would i lose my ship every time im out of town would i have to be in my pod by its self in station so my crew would not eat me in rl i know the captain of any naval ship doesnt have to manage the food supply of the ship and make sure the crew gets fed thats delegated down the hill to someone less important similar to how we dont get to really fly joystick our ships just point and go i want to fly that way to the helms men and he does the joystick part for mei can see it now im in the middle of a huge fleet flight im selecting targets activating my gunswebsscrams and the voice for skill training complete pipes up saying something like warning the crew is on strike due to lack of food feed your crew if you expect them to continue to work for you my guns stop firing my tank turns off and we all die im down to make the game more realistic but i dont think your idea would add to the game much other then another frustrating game mechanic you have to also remember that ccp would only half implement your idea anyway maybe they would leave out the button that allows you to feed your crew in a rush to get the new content out the door in the rushed patch to fix the lack of the button they mess up and make food take up 5ms per unit and make it so its 1 unit of food per crew member what would you do thennow i do like the idea of having a crew of people you could select from different planets and have them bring there own skills with them to add to your ship i like it but i have a feeling no one wants to code that into the game at allever how many worlds are in eve how many people would crew your ship how would to balance each different raceplanet with each other all things they would have to think about and code for i would like to see it but have a feeling it would take more code to implement then incarna
all ships would have special cargo holds just for food and if your offline food could be consumed sloweralso you should feed your crew before the battle also maybe the lower your sec status the less food your crew eats since they are like pirates but they also dont perform as good as a crew thats captain has a good sec status
you could take it a step further and give the ship itself some kind of experience mechanic ie the more combat the ship and crew sees and you manage to keep it alive the more effectively it does certain thingsfood could probably just be represented by a supplies function that gets consumed at a steady rate when not docked at a station
this is a bad idea ive had a broadsword now for something like a year and a half its been in a number of large battles bubbled a ton of supercaps including bubbling 2 titans doomsdaying the grid at the same time and it still lives if this experience thing was in effect itd be pretty much invincible by now and im sure people have ships far older than that
how about adding a 05 chance someone in your crew will kill all of you by screwing with the oxygen because you stole him off of a planet
sid meyers pirates
im not supporting this as much as i like the idea of being able to space one of my more useless crewmen not only as an example to the rest but also for the pure fun of it
because its an automatic assumption the bonuses would be hugeright
i like the experience thing so maybe it could like cap at 10 bonus max but that would take forever to get also with incarna you can walk in your spaceship and see the crew working and maybe beat them if they are bad or give them rewards if they are good it would kinda be like an episode of battlestar galatica mixed with the campain thing from sc2 where you see all the parts of the hyperion but set in an eve background of course i can understand some people may not like this idea but thats just because its way to awesome for them to comprehend
theres only one ship in the game that has a chance of tackling you when it uncloaks if youre aligned like you should be and thats a stealth bomberthat said a stealth bombers life expectancy against pretty much any ship in the game at tackling ranges is from when it uncloaks and roughly until when you lock it do you really think it needs further nerfing cause it doesnt seem that way to me
i made a post about this too perhaps i should have searched for the topic first so instead of linking it i will post what i wrote as no doubt my thread will get lockedanticloaking shockwave acsthe acs device will emit a massive shockwave that knocks all ships out of cloak within a single system and prevents cloaking for a limited durationthis device is an ihub upgrade and must be fitted to a pos some fuel will be required to activate the device only 1 device can be installed per systemwhen the shockwave fires all ships including friendlies will be unable to cloak for a limited durationthis could not only have some strategic benefits in large fleet battles when trying to defend your home system for example but it will hinder those who try to cloak up 24 hours a day with their alts the reason i came up with the idea in the first placehow it might workyou will not be able to activate the acs device instantaneously if a ship fitted with a cloaking device jumped into your system and the acs device was immediately activated it would be too easy for the defenders and the enemy would find themselves unable to cloak and most likely die therefore on activating this device you will have to wait the coming effects duration so if the duration of this device is 15 minutes you will have to wait 15 minutes before the shockwave fires this stops the exploiting of this device and ensures you will have to think carefully about activating it you will be unable to cloak aswell also because the device takes such a long time to fire it makes sense that it would have a long cooldown too in other words you wont be able to fire it again straight away people should be allowed to cloak in your system what is the point of cloaking devices otherwise this device just adds more strategy to the game like halting stealth bomber groups for a short period of time and even preventing that titan from cloaking if it got away somehowmore importantly it hinders those really annoying people with far too many alts that cloak up in your system 24 hours a day whilst playing on another one of their characters somewhere else periodically checking for any signs of activity with their cloaked up alt and those people that go to sleep at night and afk to stop you from conducting your business how id love to see these selfish  go afk one day and die because of it theyll have to be a little more careful when harrassing you from then on
i would agree with this if you were in a drake raven and even a sniper fitted ship whilst killing belt rats but what if your not blaster boats cant do this its impractical and lets not forget that sometimes the rats can scramble you if you were being watched thats most likely you dead i dont mind if someone jumps in and takes me down by chance because of the annoying rat that scrambled me thats all good yes ill be gutted but ill still be cool with itso your supposed to wait for other people to rat with you and if there is someone there to help your takings are gimped dont be silly besides there are other factors to take into consideration here but lets not list themexcuse me what if your doing an anomaly this is impractical not everyone has the isk to buy t3 ships because of the afk cloakers that stay their griefing periodically some anomalies can be difficult and so again your forced to gimp yourself and do that crap anomaly instead because of the selfish players who have many accounts they can cloak up in your system and rat somewhere else with another character if they wanted toobest idea youve had excellent workanother simple and effective idea but it is an ifagain this isnt always possible mining barges are really slow too and aligning out is hardly practical anyway and why should you have to wait for other people all the timesee my reply to nuts nougat abovecloaking should be allowed as ive already mentioned but not the in the way selfish people with multiple accounts use the mechanic and to further add to this these people who harrass in this manner are guaranteed to not be present at their computer the whole time and even when they are present they wont be staring at the screen indefinately searching for people the whole time they are theyll be searching the internet using a different character or watching a film so ill end this by saying that not everyone has an alt and we all know how much of a difference just 1 alt can make dont be selfish show some respect to other people that pay to play this game some of which that can barely afford it
im sorry to counter your point but no one has ever countered my real world cloaking ship
acually the arazu is designed to do just thatsit cloak n wait then get in range of a suitable target drop cloak warp scram and light cyno to bring in his supercap fleet to kill a single target
as you said yourself it has to drop cloakthat means you can neut it jam it hello my ec300sand if you are aligned the chance of getting caught by it is relatively lowcompetent people will still manage to kill you especially when it is a super carriertitan hotdrop on your carrierjf but well nothing gives you 100 safety except for not logging in
i lold
please dont try to troll if your not going to be constructive dont post
having two pos modules to triangulate an afk coakers position after a 12 hour period would be a decent idea this would only hurt afk cloakers as anybody warping around would break the lock however normal ship movement should not break the signal lock as then people would just light their engines to keep moving
lets just sprinkle some pixie dust on all the wining carebears and make them invulnerable to all attacks but this would make me sad as carebear tears are oh so tasty
oh damn so your whole post was seriousit must suck to lack constistancy in argumentationi feel bad for you
when running multiple clients and other programs the taskbar gets crowded making the show window identification option somewhat meaningless example please visit your user settings to reenable imagesplease visit your user settings to reenable imageswould it be possible to change eve  chainsaw plankton to chainsaw plankton  eve or maybe even show the character portrait i think that would be cool just go down and click on the character portrait that i want to switch to
or like get windows 7
that is windows 7 oh and supported
well with my version of windows the eve clients stack upon themself then when i hover over the icon the  of running clients pops up in the minidisplay they have my accounts are also color coded so i can tell what char it is at a glance
greetings fellow pilots n piratesi have a few suggestions that would improve gameplay for many people these are firstly multiple toon training on one accounts not everyone can afford two accounts secondly a paint shop would be nice example so if you join a corp you can have special colours or decals to represent youre corp and it is not always nice to see a ship exactly the same as you and have the exact same colours thirdly training time is a bit ridiculous like i need to train 31 days or somethingg for tech two turrets by then ill have a capital ship and no longer require medium tech two turrets then itll be 129 days for tech two large turrets it really is unfair that you require small beam laser specialization level iv and small turrets skills that really has to be changed also you should be able to claimcolonize planets and well i guess thats it for nowmeracle out channle closes
first point no stop being lazy you can buy gametime with isk its not difficultsecond point that would be interesting but that would also give the lagmonster even more powerthird point you know nothing capships will take you 6 months to just sit in the things at least a year to fly one with basic supporting skills
210 because you got one to bitejust incase your uber noob and are serious paint jobs would be awesome but less lag would be even more amazing training multiple characters on one account just means that ccp will lose more actual cash and i really dont mind paying isk for 3 accounts honestly its not that hard to buy plexslastly long training skills is actually what draws alot of people to the game because when you finally get that carrier you actually feel like youve accomplished somethingso the only thing i would support is the paint jobs only after the lag monster is fixedac
i was half asleep and came up with this idea to better assist account management for some reason my internet was failing and refused to let me connect regardless now it is working most players have alt characters some have few some have many why not introduce an optional account linking procedure could work as followsi could log in to saithe on either evegate or eveo and select account options from there i could click link account type in the name and password of the account a confirmation code would be sent to the email address of the account being linked from there on my alt characters would be linked to saithe so i would be able to access any options for my other accounts by logging in to saithe instead of each account individuallythis could be beneficial in that it would give players the ease of account management without multiple logins this wouldnt be displayed publically so keeping secrecy of your alts would be kept in tactcomments discussion
supporting my topic obviously
also add the ability to pay for all accounts at the same time
thatd be a nice option too have it check to see how many accounts are linked when you go to pay for an account and pay for as many as you need to if you dont need to pay for all of them at once
as long as as your op says its optional i have no arguments not to allow it that should suit the needs of both the uber paranoid who say no way am i linking my precious accounts and those who would like the convenience of being able to do sosupported
decent proposal only reason im not supporting it is that ccp needs to add some layers of account protection behind the scenes before i think this can be feasible after that and some more additions to account security to make the linking safe itd get my full support
yea this feature would be 100 optional if implemented if you do not initiate the account linking then your accounts wont be linked plain and simple

your posts hurt my eyes please go away
i would think that the act of dropping capitals itself is a commitment1 bait caps2 drop super caps3 4 profiti know im doing it wrong but it doesnt make sense with three
ok lets make an example of how your idea will work new patch changes some shipmodule characteristic for example changing the launchers you can use in a stealth bomber from cruise missile launchers to siege launchers you log in and launch in your cruise sb to kill some player ship the client start to upload the patch in the background you attack your target and your client happily launch the cruise missiles at this point you can get different results a the server is updated and say this ship cant use those weapons and your missiles disappear when the server reply to the client with your action results you die horribly when your target react b the server accept that your client is not upgraded and let you fire the missiles you get a big range advantage against a a ship of the same model used by someone that has already updated the clientanother example you have undocked in your ubership with 8 missile launcher slots and damage missile bonus and small drone bay while you are doing your stuff the client is updated and suddenly half of your launcher go off line as you ship now has only 4 launcher slots the missile damage bonus disappear but you get a large but almost empty drone bay and a bonus to drone hp and damage you say what the as your ship change under you there are plenty of examples like those asteroid ores changing composition blueprint changing materials used and so on and on in a mmorpg all the players should use the same client and the same rules when interacting with the server if people had the possibility to use a older client while it is updated we would have players duplicating the older versions that allow exploits or simply that allow them to use uber set up that were changed as unbalanced very bad idea in no game you can have people playing with different set of rules
could we try getting them working first
heres for hoping only i did pick my race on story but turns out im more of a amarr at heart lolzi dont see why they would not just let us redo the hole toon when remaking them as differnt races mite or probly will have differnt looks and the new looks of your race in 3d mite not be what you would have picked if it was 3d reather then 2d the first time though
cant you just rp your way out it im a turncoat gallente who runs slaves for the amarr empire imagination
you could say that you got a crush on a minmitar pilot and hoping to get himher to notice you started flying minmitar ships that pilot never did notice you but the ships you flew started to grow on you they appealed to the efficient minimalist in you and after that you just never wanted to fly anything elsewow that was easy
of course it was but lets face it this thread was never really about rp anyway it was about i dont like being amarr or whatever and want to change cause i only picked that race to max out the attribs i wanted in the first place
not supported if it gets to you that much buy a character that is of the appropriate race
why is using a sensor booster on a criminal a bad thing when i can sensor boost someone im not at war with they should be the same thing if youre supporting someone while they pound a wartarget you have not declared war with you should have your ship taken away by concordps the proposal is to make anyone who assists a person attacking a wartarget to get a gcc only when another wartarget is being shot not as soon as you do it
wooo yes align to bookmark sound great
no offense but can i suggest you look at one of the dozens of other threads about this and post therebelow are two similar threads
lol that would be too easy one button click per planet why would anyone want that i love clicking till my pointer finger bleeds dont you supported
i am sorry  i dont want to troll or be meanbut whoever started this thread must not be from the usa because congress doesnt do ht  and if you were from here you would know that thank you  that is all ps vote them all out in 2010
adding this sort of service is probably inevitablenearly every mmo that has skillpoints has allowed respecs at some point that said i am not sure i like it however you have to accept that at some point ccp is going to give awaymake cheaper or faster certain skills because the longer the game goes and the greater the disparity in sp and ability to fly stuff becomes between established players and new ones the harder it is for eve to gain new playersthat is something that we might as well accept something like giving new accounts a much longer period of 2x skill train or eliminating or granting on creation all the learning skills is inevitable when it comes ill  about it as much as anyone but it is going to happen somedaywhat i dont like though is this dabbling with opening an eve cash shop as in adding rmt to a premium subscription game this is all the rage now in the industry developers making stuff for a premium subscription game then holding out items and sometimes even content for the cash shoponce it is established that plex items can be used for things other than game time that genie is out of the bottle
i see a lot of complaints about more risk averse players wanting this game made easier and safer and to me having access to an sp remap is the same type of thing hell my main has more sp in useless skills than i like to think about but i dont complain much i just get on with what needs to be trained next live with your choices dont whine about them
cool story bro
no content in op locked
mazz is on a roll
everytime i log in with any of my 7 accounts my windows move this latest feature is making me think about not paying ccp the 100 euros a month for this game i currently doif your gonna do it ccp do it right pls ffs
1 hope todays optional fix my stuff ups patch fixes it
hell yes
just do it
chuck norris wants a new font
20 more dps oo jesus freaking christ man are you thinking before you make ed ideas loldo you know how crazy the vindicator is going to be then yeah you have to take the vindicator into the picture here toi know vindicators like to om nom nom ravens very fast today but taking 100 of the ravens shield in 2 volleys is way to much tbhlike i have said earlier a 5 dps increase and like 10 tracking increase should be a good start
first tell me why 800mil ship should not kill 70mil ship nom nom very fastsecond nightmare can do 80 vindicators damage at 300 rangethird vindicators bonus was changed from 25 to 375 after people complains so vindicator is just the one fine tuned hybrid weapon ship why it is so good in damage because it has good dps with old good webifier 10 velocity factor per level ps usual gallente ship is much worse they do not have 375 damage bonus and bonused web ridiculous tracking considering range
your choice of formula makes very little sense to me and i have a degree in math saying its good because you cant think of anything better is not a good argument its kind of like telling someone you punched their son because you couldnt think of a better child of theirs to punch at least explain why you think this is a useful way to score weapons it seems you just took some variables that seemed pertinent lined them up and threw some s and s in there i mean the first term seems to want to be the damage output and the second term the range but why does multiplying them together make sense why dont you just go ahead and multiply the result by tracking and then multiply that by the cap penalty
uhm i own a vindicator my self and i have seen what the vindi can do in damage dealingi know the vindicator is supposed to take quite alot of dps but my vindicator are already doing 1450 dps and with a 20 dps boost my vindicator will do 1800 dps with a cheap faction setup  cheap damage implantsdo you know how freaking overpowered a 250k ehp and with around 2500 dps vindicator after the 20 dps boost is going to be even for a price of 800 mill iskand not only that but think about the bears who will come to the forum and cry like a mofo that someone in a vindicator popped his megathron in 15 secs
i said vindicator is just the one fine tuned hybrid weapon ship  it means vindicator works like a blaster boat should work this ship has the fair dps advantage in exchange of the range disadvantagei expect if ccp boost hybrid weapon end of 20112012 they will consider ships that become overpowered after boostjust for now i do not understand some thingswhy blasters have the almost the same tracking as ac but ac falloff is longer in 2 timesneutron  13am16null 800mm  24emp36barragewhy pulses have 85 blaster damage at 300 blaster optimal with scorch 400why rails have less tracking than tachyon even with 375 ship bonus megathron 425mm  001653 hyperion 425mm  001202 tachyon  00174
it is in general a good idea to ignore people that try to argument about her slaved multi billion isk bs as baselinethat also got fixed webs instead the 60 fail most people are supposed to work with while totally ignoring the shortcoming of all more common t1 and t2 hulls btw nmx i can do 145k dpsbefore heat in my affordable megathat i dont fly anymore that doesnt make it a good solo gank ship or a passable small gang ship in low sec most of the time since you cant put this dps well on the targets and it is terrible at catching stuff
supporting option for increased security
i would certainly consider buying it
ftw
sounds good
great idea protect my stuff ccp
yeah baby yeah
no amount of key fobs or additional security will ever beat common sense9 times out of 10 the problem starts with the idiot at the keyboard the ones who click on links to sites that are not legitimate the ones who download software without restraintyou cant fix stupid and i seriously doubt ccp will even bother to do this properly if such a proposal would come to passas long as its option i dont have a problem with itbut mark my words this is a patch at best not a solution
passwordless login a la ssh please
support uve got it m8 good ideas in here
this is part of the account security enhancements proposal which is still in the csm backlogwe can discuss this again during the december summit and try to get it raised in priority
as long as it stays optional
so to clarify how many times do we have to raise what is obviously a good idea before ccp will consider it three five
over 9000
thanks tea however the security tokens seems to be a small footnote in the proposal you linked its mostly concerned with character transfer proceedingsi might add that if account management was secured by rsa key it would be much much harder for anyone to initiate an unauthorized character transfer i want to stress that rsa keys are perhaps the single best security mechanism that could be added and we should be clear that it should be the first priority not a long term security improvement to consider
sounds good
ooh yeah this would be great maybe as an alternative to the rsa a usb or smartcard thing maybe got the usb plugged in then dont need password
support
i suppose this i have used rsa while i was in the us navy and we currently use it at my current job
a keyfob would be nice it would give me an excuse to carry around more eve related stuff on my person
yeah this is something i like
i have to agree if i want to move a small fleet of my own ships to do something somewhere else i dont want to do courier i want to bloody well do it myself in a my ship dont care how just care that i can without the extraneous bs involvedi support the idea not necessarily this particular implementation but definitely the core idea
against this proposal
absolutely hate the idea of allowing the purchase of remaps
meh
any move towards micro transaction even if milimetric is the end really end for this game
plex for isk is enough do not add a payshop in eve
that terrible feature increase the demand of the plexes while not increasing supply make it otherwise increase plex supply by implementing this featurelet people pay 35 double plex price for free neural remap an option available in account management for this fee you are receiving free neural remap and a plex to use or to sell
terribly wrong direction ccp
neural remaps once a year beyond the extra one you get at the characters creation is it should bei do not want to see this game on a slippery slop to being a space based wow
i use this app every day both for character tracking and reading the blogs i would happily lend monetary support should ccp grant permission for it i would hate to see it go by the wayside
1come on ccp just employ these guys to turn capsuleer into an even better eveonline mobile tool than it already isuse it every day and if nothing happens thanks for the best app on my iphone
capsuleer rocks i have used it since i started playing the game it so nice to have a mobile application to check skills and plan your training queueeven more so is the blog pack attached to the application for the times that i have not been able to play eve lately this has kept me interested in the game i have learned much about the game and enjoy chuckles from the escapades of pirates without it my interest for eve will die out unless time starts to free up morenote if you built evegate into capsuleer you would have much success most people cant play eve whenever the would like nor have the ability to use a computer to check evegate during workschool hours majority of people have phones and can take a quick 30secs to 5 mins to use them
please ccp there must be something you can do some ground you can give  make it an official product and allow us to login and change skills etc surely pj sam and roc could be compensated adequately for their time and effort without breaking the ccp bank im sure capsuleer has helped the bottom line no end already it has been a first intro to eve for many of my rlf friends and helped me seal the deal to get them up and running on a trial and ultimately subs for some
1 to op
love this app dont let it die
supportedccp reach out to these guys they have done some really good work they are obviously quite passionate about the gamemy gut tells me that ccp has decided internally to develop the application and just being mum on it if they are unfortunately thats the risk that the guys at capsuleer took when they developed the application i really hope thats not the case ccp probably has one of the smartest pool of players of any mmo community it would bode well with them to form partnerships with shops like this and allow developers to charge a reasonable fee to recoup investment dollars in the long term they will encourage players to help them innovate and ultimately grow subscribers in making tools available to help them in what is a very complex and great game
capsuleer may be a great iphone app but its not ccps concern lets be real and focus any aggressionpleading to the ones responsible  the capsuleer devs if ccp gets involved theyll open the door to a whole mess of problems that they frankly dont need showing bias etctherefore im saying ccp keep your hands off capsuleer if you love the app plead with the devs to keep it open but dont spit against the wind on something ccp honestly cant deal withnot supported
suported
they dont require a damn thing they want it they want to get paid to develop capsuleer and decided that it wasnt worth their time otherwise theres no reason to give the capsuleer developers special treatment compared to all the other everelated apps out there
actually it is entirely the point of this petitionliang
supportedim not going to get involved with who is wrong or right i just wanted to say that this app is invaluable to me and its a crying shame to see it get plugged all the parties involved with this should be dammed ashamed of themselves and if its too much hassle to continue  then make the code open source so as others can continue the project
if liang is correct why would ccp play favorites to 3rd parties was what they were asking for would it make 3rd parties like evemon and eft get special licensing agreements with ccp to make their software i use capsuleer but you guys started this before you know whats going on herenot supported
this is really a bad day for people loving eve and owning an iphonesupportedsent from my iphone

theres nothing to speculate about whose fault it is capsuleer devs are pulling the plug because they cannot charge for their app they developed their app with the intent to charge for portions of it and did so before obtaining a license from ccp the only thing they need a license for is to charge for it there is no roadblock other than moneyallowing people to charge real money for 3rd party apps is a far more dangerous precedent than all the plex for remaps rabble thats been going on a thousand times not supported
as the writer of a newsletter that frequently mocks a few alliances and corps and individuals as well i find it singularly irritating that i cannot link their names in the newsletter
no excuse to not fix low hanging fruit and simple convenience and all that
this should have been in the game a long time ago
yeah this would be nice
im in support of this after fiddling around with evemon and working the numbers i dont believe this could get outrageous it offers stopping points to an other wise 1 year long cycle for instance a miner who has memint training will want to roll memint until he has maxed out his character development in that area however pretend this miner have one year decides to max planetary interaction before going over to the science skills he would remap his skills for 2 months before working towards sciences for another 10 months not fully buffed to most that wouldnt seem logical and so the miner might just train science and skip what he really wanted to dosame can be said for someone training in ships and wanting to pick up tech 2 heavy drones or an intercepter training for pvp tackle training for speed first i dont think this is as major as a problem as everyone is talking about at most i can see someone trying to remap once every 2 or 3 months anymore then that and people will just be sinking money ineffectively for those of you who dont want to save up for multiple plexes every month its still cost effective to try and plan while forgoing that one skill v that takes forever to train although you would love itim fully in support of this and i highly doubt that this will be the doomsday prediction everyone on the forums is crying about
had you actually read the doomsday predictions you would now be realizing that you and the point are not even in the same postal codeallow me to elaborate againthe point is you are now allowing plex to be used to evade an inconvenient game mechanic so that those who are willing to acquire them be it via isk or by rl cash can skirt around one of the rulestm of the game  that being thou shalt not remap thy attributes more than once a yearthe concern isnt with being allowed to remap more than once a year i think once every six months would be grand  it is to what other uses will ccp decide to extend this pay to avoid the consequences business modeloh no my alliance lost our supercap fleet because we all self destructed480 plex please and this problem too can be wiped away as if it never happenedyes my example is extreme but hopefully you actually understand why were concerned now
actually i still dont you said that was the rules of the game but im pretty sure those rules have been changed before when i first started playing which was a long time ago and that account is lost to the history of the internet i dont ever recall neuro remapping i picked my character and that was it some skills were handed to me and my attributes were preset they changed that system and i would have to say that worked for the best we can now neuro remap once a year and that system is grandits still to clingy though for the first 50 million skillpoints its hard to do anything super well until you maxed it out but if youre maxing even one thing out it takes a very long time even with 33 in primary skill as far as i understand plexs are eves way of character control they allow you to do specific things to your character like play for free and in this case remap money only affects your character though it cant affect your ship or how well you fly it in the case of plex for remapping it will indirectly affect how well you fly it but minimally as youre character still has to train through the skills that take a lot of time even maxedfurthermore you can already spend a whole lot of money on plexes buy supercap ships on market or pay an alliance to trade you some and undo your mistakes the only way to fix that though is to take away the plex system which means it will go back to third partiesif you spend more money on eve you will get ahead faster same as any other game even though you have to do it through third parties this is going to be a great change for people wanting to spend time specializing in minor job roles that dont have the ability to sink a full year into like trading or archeology it really isnt doomsday at all
not supportedplex is the mechanism to convert rl  to iskall other ingame activities are bought with isk neural remapping should be controlled by isk as well a better solution is to have ccp implement neural remapping as part of the gamesuggestions1 loot drop from pirate npcs that allows for neural remap2 issue bpos that build a neural remapping device3 nueral remap devices as part of lp storeif you then want to use plex to convert your rl  into isk to purchase a neural remap device then do so at your convenience
what thats even worst then the original idea no period imo neural remap once a year after you use up your free one is how it should bethis is not wow or a korean mmo
im just agreeing because i was swayed by the pretty screenshots
now dont put a bug in ccps collective ears they might want to start advertising the latest in intel cpu technology or what notim all for it as long as the contents of said ads are strictly game relatedlax
nope not true at all i dont know who gave you that idea but theyve misled you
ok you are right im sorry i did not look it sorry again
i support b revoque the insure for aggressors cause its an illegal activitybecause it makes sense you shouldnUFFFDt get paid for it and being able to make a business out of it
first a link 
in stead of increasing costs they should apply benefits insteadsov costs are incredibly insane thats why you dont see them claim well trashy systemsso instead of making it worse give them a reason to claim the empty systems say a slight percentage boost to reinforcementless fuel consumption on poss or something thats slightly increased but not enough to break the balance that and it wont compound the costs as it will balance out
my crews only eat the finest sawdust and can wear casual clothes
perhaps the idea should be moved  not to ships  but to possa pos will run a tad more efficiently with military  scientists  janitors  and so onneat idea  not sure if i like it or dislike it though
i can see it now ccp has the opportunity to usurp zyngas grasp on the entire facebook communityeve online crewville
too many trolling indeedjust because some people wants hic sec to become a safer place are just called carebears and invited to left the game if i were a mod ill give more than one warning another argument is you blame agains suicide ganks you troll and even threaten to report to op another argument is you say op is rigth you must be an alt of the opi can see many hates carebears dont know why and too little respect to those players that likes to play without pvp this is a sandbox ok but this not a game where to destroy players ships and pods is mandatoryim agree with the op i think suicide ganks must be more punished fly safe
would like to see a cruiser class ship which would be able to link signals from fleeted scan ships probes1 cruiser class2 decent tank3 able to use covert ops cloak or possibly speed hit when cloaked4 able to gather data from fleeted ships deployed scan probes  receive scan res bonuses5 able to direct fleet via warp to command wo warping itselfgranted would need some offsets like very few high slots maybe only 23sorry for not being clear in initial post would like this ship to be like an awacs or ccc where yes all friendly fleet probe results can be used by ccc ship to more rapidly determine possible targets  perhaps warp the entire fleet there wwo itself or possibly warp different wings to different target groups target bm would automatically be fed to fleet groups  scan ships
thats not the point the point is that a you cant really do anything to counter a cloak be it a spy watching you for a hot drop or a macro ratter sitting cloaked in a safe spot once that cloak is active they are invulnerable the point of the threat was a possible counter no whining just a mere suggestion but meh
that is like asking for a counter to sitting in station or a pos
yes i was quite aware that constructive and sensible replies were few and far between when it comes to forums people troll too muchill tell you what guys ill do you a favorelvor dark cries and rages what an emo lolseriously its like i said if you cant be constructive then please dont bother to post all your doing is avoiding the subject by exclaiming the same things weve all heard time and time again get outdareaper was right to an extent although its the afk cloakers that bug me most its all well and good coming in and looking for an easy kill but to effectively camp the system 247 is taking it a bit too farmassive emphasisits the fact that people dont do this and they can leave their alt cloaked up at any time and not even have to be there to cause a nuisance quite simple really and its not like my idea covered only that alone there was a strategic element to it alsomassive emphasis
elvorits a waste of time these socalled pvpers do not want risk added to their playstyle even though they are able to influence and pose a potential risk to othersthe most you can hope for is that the sensible person is reading and understanding exactly whats wrong with these breeds of afk cloakers
yeah you could be right matrixskye i was just hoping people would discuss the idea not troll me on the first reply to my post more replies like yours would be welcome though and i personally dont think people should just give in at the first sign of opposition
isnt that the point of covert reconnaissance
i support any mechanism against afk cloakers
if you dont like people to become afk you have an ease solution ask ccp to monitor is a client is inactive more than 15 minutes and disconect this client from the game but leave cloak devices untouched a nerf in this sistem will affect many player like me how likes using sb or covert ops or blockade runners or

the amount of bugs and issues brought forward by tyrannis 11 is quite simply disgusting manymost of which were not addressed or resolved in the optional patchthe amount of bugs this patch has spawned can be found hereafter reading through the list of bugs the current state of the game is clearly unacceptable for a paid for product for some people the game is unplayable simply due to being logged out too frequentlyi propose rolling back to pre 11 and getting ccp to do the 11 patch properly and actually implementing some sort of a qc processall in all i believe this thread to be the key as 11 is a perfect example of ccps lack of care towards product quality
im not sure what the  they didor what they where thinkingi may not have suffered nearly as bad and im a mac client user for crying out loud but ive heard nonstop complaints from my membership and my alliancethis is utterly insanewhat the hell is ccp using for coders monkeysseriously do they even beta test there own product anymoreim sorry but this has me utterly scared of patches anymorei cant support this but then i want to support this roll back how the heck do we know it was working before thenthe lack of qc is outrageously beyond stupid
this will never happen ever
if you have a subscription just cancel it and enter in the commentreason the tyrannis 11 patch and ccps continuing lack of dedication professionalism and excellence thats what ive done
not really sure weither to classify this as a propsal or a petition basically i would like to know if there is anything in the pipe for the audio aspect of the game as well as provide a place for suggestion  discussion on what sort of changes we players would like to seehear pweve all heard the meme i personally stopped playing with sound a few months after i started playing but i recently relocated my computer to living room and hooked it up to the home theater system so i decided to give it another gothe result aside from some changed sound effects all the old problems  bugs that made it unattractive then still exist not to mention the sounds just really dont do most things justice except megapulses they sound incredible ever hear dual 1000mm rails it sounds more like a bb gun then some huge super duper siege weaponry ccp you have stated many times that your intent is to create the best most comprehensive scifi universe how do you intend to fulfil such a lofty goal with an audio system that is bug ridden resource intensive and all around crap atm sound is such an integral part of any experience what would a top fuel drag or formula 1 race be without the rummble and scream of the engines a sports game without the roar of the crowd insert vuvuzella joke here you get the idea sound is incredibly important for adding depth and emotion to any experienceso is there anything planned on the white board some things i would personally like to seepositional sound with hq encoding something like dolby digital thx would be winsaucesome fine tuning of existing effects in that many sound effects drown out others such as hardners electronics  ewar being excessively loud when compared to guns repsboosters  enginesmore variation in the sound effects for more flavor better impact soundsstreamlining of the existing sound engine or acquire a new one so that it does not degrade from game performance as badly as it currently doesmore sound options maybe i would like to have only ui sounds but nothing elsedecouple the station backgroud sounds from the world sounds category specific case the chanting in amarr type stations its way louder runs longer and all around more annoying then any other station world sound anyway thats just my 002 on it would love to hear what others have to say on the topic
not all mid to low level reactions get done in deep 00 so prolly gonna take a while before you see that
i find it much faster to just go and click on the correct client no need to mouse over and wait for the thing to pop up with the visuals and then pick which one and click plus it should be an easy change
i would like to suggest a feature that when you are in the standing tab of the character sheet you can right click on a corporation and choose to track your standing with that corporation with a inchat messagea more advanced version of that would also tell you how much standing you need to gain with that corp to reach the next level of agent missions
due to rl work and family wise time constraints im forced to drop this candidacy i had big projects and ideas for eve that would had required alot of my rl time and i refuse to run just to be an average candidate i wont be supporting any other candidacy but i feel that your vote matters so i plea everyone to vote in someone the more votes a candidate has behind him the greatest moral empowerment he has behind him when he discusses things with ccpbest luck to all other candidates running for csm6 aelius 2011 csm candidacy guidelines after some thought i came to the conclusion that addressing many issues in the csm next year was going to be counterproducing since ccp is going to have very little time for eve vampires turning to dust will have their hands full so ive chosen just a few issuesfeatures to take upon discussion at 2011 csm1st ladies and gentleman is the complete removal of local chat in nullsec and lowsec as it now works in wh spacei know that i will lose a lot of votes in pursuing such a goal specially from carebears and macrominersmacrorattersthe last two i couldnt care less since they arent actual eve players cheaters instead the first ones i can understand that my candidacy is a direct attack to their eve way of life so i expect to be thrown every thing at me including the kitchen sinkreasons to remove local from lowsec and nullsec make dangerous space really dangerous without the all seeing local players must rely on other ingame features like dscan  tactics will improve since cloak ships will have an huge role increasing the unknown factor in a battle the value of lowsec and nullsec commodities will increase adding to risk vs reward small gangs can now more effectively roam in nullsec making large fleet battles a bit less a common place thus reducing lag created from them important blows to enemies can now be done using less numbersdisadvantages if you use lowsec and nullsec like an high reward highsec2ndthe introduction of tactical environments in most null and lowsec eve solar systems as seen herelinkageoveurs post from 2005these two features working together would enrich the value of null and lowsec taking eve back to its roots as a rough harsh and immerse pvp game 3rd force ccp to act upon bots and macroers with swift justice ban rmters or not

guess who doesnt have my vote
i have a little over a year in game i dont agree with the comment that veterans in the game cant relate to new players i still remember the pains of my first six months as do the people i met that had been playing for three to five years it is kind of hard not to remember those instances of wtf i hope that you are not suggesting that ccp dumb down eve to make it more appealing to new playersthe challenge of the game is one of the factors of eve that is most appealing you do have to put in effort to prosper i dont think that the people that are playing today would still be paying to play a dumb downed version of the game that grabbed teir attention in the first place other than the large volume of questions and answers flowing on the help channel i always got a reply to the dumb questions i asked through watching it i learned from others questionsthe community that i came in contact with was also very helpful and had helpful tips from when they only had a few months ingame three or four years beforeplease dont advocate dumbing down  the game
do you support the introduction of more microtransactions ingameplease post yes no or cosmetic onlyin support of the no votes i have resigned from the csm as 1st alternate say no to microtransactions keep eve awesomelast tally no 7903  yes 502  cosmetic only 1123  other 473
please include yes no or cosmetic only on the first line of your response so that i can add up the results easilyyou do not need to support this topic and all thumbs up will be ignored during the countif you wish to comment please add it on the third linewhile this proposal will stay open i will be compiling the results a week after incursion is released please be resonable  people are allowed their opinions and trolling is not necessary  there are many valid arguments for each side and there are infact more logical arguments for having microtransactions ingameexample reasons to votevote no  you think that because you pay a set fee each month that you should have access to all the options and features ingame that everyone else getsvote cosmetic  you think that the only microtransactions ingame should be those that allow you to buy items that effect nothing of consequence such as plex for boobies or hats nice clothes nipples etc which do not effect anything although they may restrict the sandbox and lessen the chances of more miniproffesions but what something looks like and how many layers of clothes you wear when you play the game in the privacy of your own homevote yes  you do not mind 12yearolds stealing their parents money because theyre so crap at the game that they need to buy more animals for their farm because you can then you blow em up and take all their stuffthankstamber
ccp probably has difficulty fueling growth from subscriber count so maybe theyre trying to get more money from existing subscribers this is a bad idea and is going to end up corrupting the fun of the gamei dont have a problem with the microtransaction sort of things ccp has now character transfer portrait change and plex for gametime that sort of stuff is fine because it doesnt really require you to do this to get an ingame advantage or else is something you would be paying anyways i dont even have a problem with the cosmetic hats and stuff but there is no guarantee that ccp will make items that are not purely cosmetic but are also useful in pvp or pve or stuff like that even if the current people have pure intentions there is no guarantee that the people that replace them willso im saying no lets have the cosmetic stuff only but i dont really believe for a second that ccp will stop at cosmetic items
how much is there left to add we already have plex for isk  isk for almost anything so we might as well go all in id like to see a plex payment option for character transfers portrait swaps and pizza
cosmetic onlydependsmicrotransactions for portraitplastic surgery or other aesthetical changes up to and under special circumstances including namechange  maybemicrotransactions for vanity items in game that do not yield any practical advantage  maybe but id rather see the development time for that go to things that are actually usefulmicrotransactions for itemschanges that give the buyer an actual ingame advantage over others  clearly not that shouldnt be the case in any game and even less in one thats subscriptionbased too
noat least not for anything that affects in game performance  remaps do affect in game performance
 no
no
noooooooooooooooooooooooedit also no to cosmetic only
noccp state in an interview that they are planned for only cosmetic effects yet the first instance will deliver an ingame advantage  plex for remap 
no
noi am crying inside myself
this is my concern as wellalthough the waters are a bit muddy you can use plex to pay for a set of 5s for example the proposed plex for remaps is taking it a step further as for example you cant lose a remap by getting poddedi am concerned about the slippery slope  where does it end plex for titans
noabsolutely not eve is a wonderful game it goes beyond being a game even since its depth is unparalleled and can be used to study many faucets of human behavior please ccp do not ruin what you have with what will surely be microtransactions of escalating value they will debilitate the game and destroy everything you built keep the game as it is leave the microtransactions for your other two products dust and wod
cosmetic onlyccp please do not destroy your own game many people play it because this is the wine of mmos  they do not want to play cheap beer in cardboard boxes please clear the  signs out of your eyes and stay true to your fans
no even cosmetic microtransactions will inevitably lead to microtransactions that give tangible ingame advantages hell the very first implementation of this is something that will give a tangible ingame advantage do not put microtransactions in eve they will ruin all that the game is
no
no
cosmetic only
thats the best analogy of eve there is eve is classy and somewhat exclusive because of the people who choose to play it this is eves best and most valuable asset adding microtransactions will alienate your core audience and turn eve into a runofthemill mmorpg i dont get why ccp would want to mess with eves proven to be successful formula
nodo that and i unsub
hell no
cosmetic only
if they add micro transactions they can kiss my credit card transactions good byekudos ccp youve been slowly killing off your loyal customer base to attract new phantom players that never came and now you want to squeeze what little you have left
nowhat is next remap skills for plexships you can buy if you use plex i mean trade plex for ships special ships you cannot buy in marketdont destroy eve just to get more money
noeven if it will only be cosmetic to start with sooner or later management will force features ingame that will make a difference regarding gameplay and this will give players who are willing to fork out  for the game an even bigger advantage then they allready have
no
nolast time i checked i didnt sign up for gunbound
noabsolutely efinently not weve already seen something like  look at myspace wonderful idea then they gave in to management which emphasized cashflow and instead focusing on the core of the product theyve overloaded it with cashflow generating features the result  myspace is dead to facebook comon people dont kill one of the best internet phenomenae weve seen
no
no
cosmetic onlyany outofgame actions that give bonuses ingame are bad and not only for the game balance plexes are in the grey area as they need to be sold to another player giving a benefit to more than just the one buying plex cosmetic transactions im willing to accept as long as there is reasonable amount of content even without spending rliskies ie not do you want to wear something else than a burlab sack or maybe use something else than the standard character model pay us 2 and you can choose from our premium customer selection a pink dress doesnt make you fly faster or shoot better no matter how pink you make it
i am glad to see so many people are in favour of removing plexes from the game because that is what everyone who says no is in favour of rightstop complaining about irrelevant stuff cosmetic microtransactions stuff is far less important than current buying of isk and chars with real moneyso cosmetic
no
no but its too late nowpretty soon there will be new ships that can only be acquired by buying them from the ccp store just like in that other space mmo
no thanks
no none nada zillch nein zero
cosmetical onlyits still a business and doesnt affect the play experience a bit
nowhile im fine with cosmetic only im voting no as allowing any form of microtransaction sets a really bad precedent
no
no 
no
no 
for the love of god noeven cosmetic things suck because you lock out an entire part of the game experience for everyone except those who can afford it i pay my monthly fee makes sense that every aspect of the game is open to me if not totally feasible im not going to be officerfitting a nyx any time soon
noas easy as it is introduce microtransactions for clothing in incarna and i will introduce the eve nudist movement lets see how funny parents will find it if they see their child docking in jita with 800 peeps on 44 showing their boobs and willys son i am not paying for this insult anymoreon a more serious sidei strongly believe that this is the absolute wrong way today its only for vanity goods tomorrow its for skills fancy weapons or rare ships you just canUFFFDt be serious
absolutely noit starts with remap for plex which is an advantage and not some cosmetical stuff and ends wherejust no
no
no
hmnoif you really wanna do things like thatlet us buy those things for iskiesbut only stuff that has exactly no gameplay effect
noabsolutely the worst thing that could ever happen to eve the fact there are no micro transactions has been one of the very few reasons why players still play eve i dont want eve to become just another mmo
no
cosmetic onlyi never log on to the ingame boards but this is potentially ridiculous i was initially simply going to say no but i realize that if ccp commits to staying only with cosmetic items such as clothing for incarna characters anybody rich or stupid enough to fund eve with their money is fine by me as soon as it approaches the realm of gameplay impact some of eves core fundamentals will be damaged
no
no
no
no
cosmetic only with reservationsactually i hate any microtransactions andor cash shops but since they are a signofthetimes in mmos and are pretty much becoming inevitable in every game whether old or new then if they must be let them be truly cosmetic only yeah i did state that i support the use of plex for neural remaps but  1 i dont believe that that feature is going to be as terrible as everyone seems to think it will be and 2 that was before we learned that ccp is looking at other microtransactions as wellmy guess is that these mts are going to somehow hinge on the use of plex to open up premium shops of cosmetic goodies for the new avatars since the plex are already ingame and are moreorless an accepted feature if i am wrong and they actually set up a cash shop where you must use your cc to buy some form of token for use in the shop then i imagine that i will be leaving the game along with many others because that type of mt will inevitably lead to the purchase of greyarea items that could have an indirect impact on gameplay
a far smaller advantage than buying isk and chars with real money which is commonly accepted
noby all means keep posting ccp has a long history of listening to and accomodating the desires of its playerbase the accountant never seems to have any input into how the game is run
no
no
noemphatically no because it certainly wont stop at cosmetic items greed is a universal human trait
nooooo
no
no
nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooooooooo
to be honest if microtransactions are introduced im probably leaving eve
no
no
no
 yeah
no no no no no no no no
cosmetic only
no
no
no sry if eve is changing to that it wouldnt be the game that i love to play
nogoddamn it ccp wtf
simply one word nothis would be the end of my career
noactually i could live with a cosmetic only where things like cloth and accessories are paid by mt why not let the sissies pay my game developmentbut overall i am against the whole idea to milk players
yessome people really want to be special snowflakes i dont care if they get the opportunity to be special by buying a differentskinned megathron an exclusive piece of clothing from the microtransaction store or a special edition shuttle the mt store shouldnt be able to provide anything that will have a significant impact in the game world eg no combat ships or moduleswe already get special ships as presents jovian shuttle zephyr primae only one of which has a variant becoming available as a playercreated good the primae model being used for the noctis these items represent ingame advantages that older players get over newer playersall you folk saying no are effectively saying that token ships plex and gtc should be removed from the game
noi already pay you for this broken ass game im not going to pay you more and more as you sneak in things that will give people an edge further down the linemicrotransactions  i quit
no
absolutely not
noi would quite happily support a workable proposal that curtailed both of those as well
for us lesser skilled pilots micro transactions have been an important part of eve online for a long time i have been using 10 more dps and 15 max velocity bonus off and on for i think 9 months now its an additional 4 per week but worth it at least i have a chance in pvp with it dont take micro transactions away please
nooh my this is going places
noi dont want or need this in my eve
no
no
no
cosmetic onlyif you have to do it letting the little s and girls play with pics is fine but remaps or sp or ships or anything that effects game play is going too far
noits a big step to introduce this and a much smaller step to make it imho worse by selling usefull stuff and make it less of a sandbox destroying a unique selling point of eve
soft noi would be open to microtransactions if they were solely a means for new players to catch up  some sort of accelerated sp accrual i dont mind plex for remap however based on the interview microtransactions is going to end up being shiny ships which is just terriblehard no on cosmetic that is just dumb and creates a 2tiered play experience with no upside
no
no
hell noccp should fix the gameless on this microtransactionwhateverthefrakitscalledcrap
nohell no
despite a pretty big outcry from csm internally with zero feedback from ccp on the matter and clear player support against microtransactions ccp is just going ahead with plex for neural remap in winter expansion i have zero faith that ccp will honor the statement of confining microtransactions to vanity items only i can just imagine the epiphany that might be announced in a dev blog some fine day after microtransaction items become more commonplace and im betting incarna will be the breeding ground galore for that oh hey we just decided that to take control of the rmt situation where supercaps are being sold thirdparty well just sell them ourselves its win win guys rmters got no market and gtfo our game and ccp makes more money to expand your virtual world even more yay because i dont trust ccp to keep their word on the matter of vanity only down the road i vote a strong no on the matter of microtransactionsim bitterly disappointed in the lack of communication with csm on this matter
im not looking forward to the continuation of these player base angering trends but i have a sick feeling in my stomach that theyre only going to continue
no
played for 5 years now through thick and thin and this might be the thing that causes me to stop playing so no
noi dont care about stuff like clothes or so in incarna later but nothing like plex for remap or sp
hi cat herei jolly well say no to microtransactions gtcplex was enough to swallow but we accept it because the time you buy goes to another player character transfer  portrait swap were alread borderline this is just money in ccps pocket for bits in a database x
now were getting new faces in the next expansion um we want fixes of old stuff not face liftswe got pi thats needs tweakingwe have faction warfare that needs tweakingwe got 00 mechanics that needs tweakingwe got a very un balanced empiresnd the all mighty lag think of the children
full support hoping csm hands ccp a major drubbing after the awful patch fiasco if ever there was a need for further evidence that ccp has major problems with their qa program one need not look further than the patch from hell
i still support this quality over quantity no feature left behind
i concur i do love expansions but i as i believe others would agree can wait for expansionstheyre nice neat show awesome shiny stuff i love shiny stuff but id rather play it later with all the bugs worked out rather then complain about the broken stuff
ive been having a lot of problems with eve latelystandings have been changed my selected item and overview windows get mapped off the top of my display multiple smas show the same contentsask around and im sure youll hear similar stories rather than rollback the illadvised patches ccp insists on issuing more which would be great if they fixed anything this is just the latest development in a long line of complaints about new features over fixing old problemsso i would like to call for a subscription strike if ccp doesnt do something major to fix these glitches we should let our subscriptions lapse for the month of november assuming that there are 300 k active subscriptions ccp makes 45 million dollars a monthso they would lose that much money maybe then they would take these problems seriouslyi await your response capsuleers
that would be nice

whats next rl money for special items no thanks
when i read this interviewi can no longer ignore this thread supported 
we already have real money trading which gives an advantage to those with more disposable income
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu 
i for one am looking forward to see 25 ghost ponies available
i support anything against ccp as they are killing this gamei also vote to stop ccp from ering around on tweeter more than they answer petitions
so all of us that had to use the old system are just screwed  we all lost a ton of skillpoints because we had to wait  and that said why aim to be like world of warcraft wich has no gameplay left  you just sit there swining your credit card and then its all automated  skillpoints learning and remaps are what makes eve what eve is  change it and the whole point of eve is gone eve shop 1000000 skillspoints 9995000000 skillpoints 2599   limited offernew costumers recives a free titan  thats eve 2011 for ya
a very big no to plex for neural remap
in my opinion this detracts from the skill in planning ahead effectively a dumbing down of the game you can simply pay money to better advance rather than having to think and plan your remapfrom a rp perspective the pilots license extension is a ingame role play item to represent a subscription why would this be exchangeable for a neutral remap if we have to have this feature shouldnt it at least be for isk like everything else plex is not currency this would suggest its more financial decision rather than a featurerelating remaps directly to a plex may lead to a trend where its the norm just to keep up of course this contributes in terms of revenue but at what costi would be very disappointed to see the game heading it this direction it would be a very small step to plex for sp
i dont give a  about this tbhpersonally id have both learning skills and attributes removed
cant find a better way to kill eve please no i totally aggre with this point at least there would be aqual opportunity between players not based on irl wealthif someone then wants to buy a plex for isks in order to get his remap everybody will be happy  ccp will get real cash the plex buyer will get his remap and a player will get some extratimenot to mention that it wont increase the isk cost for plex what would be a bad news for those who cant afford to play eve for real money
no thx ccp
losing large amounts of players who refuse to be part of this sellout bull and then further large amounts who try to continue playing but get fed up being fleeced by ccp just to keep up with everyone elsethis is utter bull ccp
i support
no ccp bad boy bad boy down down bad bad boy you behave or else
bad idea theres already enough stuff you can buy with real life cash in eve either legally or not dont make skill training speed one of them everyone makes mistakes good thing about eve is theyre not permanent if you genuinely screw up your attributes and gve yourself huge charisma then train leadership and social skills for a year
please dont do this would be the first step in the very wrong direction
no no no a thousand times no this shouldnt happen dont be even ter than u already are ccp stop thinking of new crap to fill the game with and fix the stuff u already have
supported
bff fooooooooooooooools
there is nothing wrong with dinosaurs  eve should at least keep the kool ones limited remap is one of them
micro transactions are bad for the game and fly in the face of how this game is designedplex remaps are just the start of what will end up a drop off into micro transactions and having to pay 500y to buy your way into sp ships and moreevery game company says that the items wont have an advantage in game but if they have no game advantage then they have no value people dont pay for things with no value once ccp figures that out they will sell something that does have value and people who buy it will have an advantage over those that do not
this is a really bad idea would just wreck eve for me seriously dont do it
no why conform to other business practices ccp has always been exclusive in their own design and the hardcore player base has been their ticket to successhell no to the plex exchange
signed
i am against this as well and especially the way ccp went about it have you guys got new management or something cause you seem to be going away from your core principles and into the relm of lets make as much money for shareholders as possible relm instead of just being happy making a profit this is just a way for you generate more revenue a majority of the older members dont want it and i dont think it would just stop at this once you start im sure it will get more and more
oh my god the idiocy
this is just a bad idea all around the game has good points and bad points but this will ruin the game if its put into practice by giving a clear advantage to those with a greater sum of cash at their disposal the game will basically become one of those free to play games that are pointless in playing unless you buy stuff from the item store
bit late now bro you should have voted when it might have done some good
looks like a dark dangerous road if they impliment this
please ccp this is really lame youre going the same way as lotro lineage and other crappy mmos noone likes to play aanymore after a few months no sp advantages through remaps for cash
ccp you must be jokingits problematic enough with the plexes that destroy the gamestop now iceworld
well the game is ready bored me with all those lags and glitches the things r only keep me here its a spaceships and skills that still need to train so i will not cry about but will definetely reprocess my chars to a biomassotherwords  wtf ccp
please dont do this this is e the first step in the wrong direction
totally against that ccp idea
enough with this train of thought plex is for game play only and u make enough thru plexes and regular subscriptions alreadyiknow as i pay for alot of plexes myself loldont do it
wth 100 support against ccp for this one
guys when u reply to the topic there option  checkbox support this topic  check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on
great so those of us that have played for years we get what  a new car or maybe a titan ingame  get a grip ccp but hey you just go ahead with that dumb ass idea i heard guildwars 2 comes out soon then i can throw this used to be fun game in the trasher
no
no
i agree with this guy if you dont like it just dont buy it whats wrong with a little competition anyway its not as if they are recieving a free titan with every remap they are training their skills a bit faster shaving a few days woopty doo i was too busy with a small thing called life to care comon guys grow up a bit most of you just sound petty
i agree with not allowing this if ccp allows this it wont take long before they start selling magical 1m sp plex this is a direct step in turning good game in a piece of s you know whatno from me no remap for plexes
no just no ccp
omg no
n after that there the buy a federation mega for 2999 or buy all uniquely rare bs for only 9999na thanks ccp stupid idea 90 of the noobs will still leave after understanding the complexity round here wrong kinda client for the productand dont you ever dare to change that
remap for plex is the first step to sp for plex and other stuff so against it
wow goes to space
this has to be by far the dumbest idea ccp has ever had all this will do is allow give people an undue advantage over other players that cant afford to pay to remap their characters every month
do not agree eve is a harsh environment and actions and mistakes have huge consequences decisions matter dont take that awayyou want new players to stay combine this game with halo let us land on planets ride different vehicles on planets allow frigs and destroyers to fight in the atmosphere and bomb facilities there bring ambulation in stations bring more places where people can interactproducefight and you will be on the right track to have a game that will suit many playing styles and personalities will keep people engaged as knowing they are playing the best game ever and that anyone new will have to pay the same price to obtain the experience required to survive
i can say this is a real crappy idea imho and yes i do buy the occasional plex for isk  but to remap nooooooooowhy ccp why
this
wtf ccp greed are you proud of what you have built implement this and watch you fall into the shameless depths of other mediocore mmorpgs fuuu and your greed
nothing makes this worthwhile the ability to mitigate consequences of ones actions is not a part of eve
i say no to thisccp please dont go down this road
this is a nono
truely dumb ideawhy the hell should people with nice wallets in rl be able to buy advancement time to reign in the greed ccp bad enough being buying supercaps via plex without this  as well
please ccpdo not fail us 
plex are fine as they are dont ruin it too many publishers start with microtransactions and it just goes out of control next thing you know the game is free to play as a graphic chat room but anything else you want to do will cost 99 cents a pop dont even start down that path ccp
dont start pandering to the wrong crowd ing off the dedicated fan base in favor of the noob horde will be a mistake i love eve because it is a hard game i enjoy the fact that a lot of people get ed off and quit because for the most part the people that stay are good gamers i enjoy playing with other people who can think and learn to consider their actions and continue on past costly mistakes

wtf ccp
guys profit  everything elseno omfgi dont know why u r wasting time at ccp with this plex for remap thingie u should just go selling million sps for plex instantly way better profit

do not like
my alt doesnt like it either
we dont want it 
supportedi hate the games with shops many of them dont last 2 years
one of ccps worst ideas yet and that is saying a lot

soo if and when we can buy neural remaps then wheres my ability to change my ingame nameuntill i see that ability i strongly disapprove
dont turn eve into yet another pay for everything extra game
if ccp does this they will lose something every other mmmorpg has their integrity
and i was flammed when i said that this wouldcan happen
big companies corperations and kingdoms has died up through time when the greed by these became to big its workers or its people turned against itthem the same story happens herewe players that have used loooong time to train our char to its skill level can by this get overrun by rookies with monster size skills ccp u play with fire and may front the risk that a lot of old players will turn the back on u sorry to say so i hope u reconsider what u are about to do peter62

this would clearing be a disadvantage to many people what work hard for your game due to the fact i screwed over my attribute points and would love more sp this is the wrong i repeat wrong way going about it your game is benefitting from players loving to train at will while at school vacation and work if youre making this game that people can just pay for the sp point i would seriously quit and dont look back this idea is going to kill your profit as a wise man once told me stop being greedy i will not sit by and watch ccp kill a game i been playing for 5years for some extra profit i say there should be a poll players have rights to the game were playing as i understand eveonline give players the right to speak their mind all the time this is a crucial time for the game developer open there eyes and listen to the public sadly if this doesnt happen eve will die very fast i give this decision 4 thumbs down yes i can do that im a alien after all i do not support this idea at all and ccp will lose a 5yr veteran player
i think i will quit eve too if ccp decides to do thiseven if its only new clothes for plex when incarna is coming or anything like that as soon as this is possible its just a small step further to special items for moneyeverything that gives an advantage to everyone not paying extra money is bull
we are the box you just a handful of sand
quit lying ccpc
please no
why are u so upset with this  there are such things in the game already and that is called attrib implants are u not complaining about those too 
ccp stop ignoring your playerbase

wts reading and comprehensionderp derpi never said it was written by ccp you noob sheesh emo much
ya know ive read through nearly the whole thread of tambers proposal and of course these comments and i still cannot fathom the resistance nearing outright fear of something as minor as this the overwhelming argument  what will the evil ccp do next to get our money through the use of the almighty plex  borders on hysteria some of the comments especially in this thread are downright disgraceful for a supposed mature community if you dont support it say so and state your reasons but being sarcastic and less than civil is not warranted and borders on childish closeminded selfindulging behavior i and quite a few others commented in the no proposal about our dissension to that view but our comments were civil i honestly did not expect an overwhelming show of support here because everyone seems to have jumped on the fear bandwagon that this is just the precursor to a cash shop without truly evaluating the proposed feature from both sides of the fence but i did expect the responses  pro or con  to be respectful on one other point  that of this feature sidestepping a game mechanic  is not the buying of readymade characters sidestepping established game mechanics in that case the sidestepping is far and away the worse of the two by buying a character already trained you bypass all of the time training the acquiring of skill books either through the market or by salvaging as well as the experience gained from doing so while playing the game plus you acquire whatever is agreed upon in that characters hangars has the purchasing of characters ruined the game has it had a major impact on gameplay for everyone else no of course not because relatively few when considering the whole of the player base actually makes use of that feature my guess is that the proposed use of plex for neural remapping will have similar usage for the simple reason that it will not be cost effective i would venture a guess that the majority who would use it by all likelihood would do so maybe two to four times a year at most and those would be the few gamebreaker i think not cmon folks take a deep breath put away the cash shop demon fear for a moment and be rational this feature would not be the end of eve as we know it but to assuage a few of the arguments perhaps a cap on usage would be in order say a limit of three or four uses a year per character or whatever
to expect all replies to be civil on the internet is like expecting a reach around while being bumd in texasthere is no total sp increase in game when a character is traded and only the owner has changed where as with this new feature there would be an overall increase in sp although i doubt that it will be much the only issue i think there is with character trading is that postplex there isnt an equal oppurtunity for people to do so where as before hand it was fair while i think this topic is relevant to the conversation for me this is a minor issue and its more the plex mechanic that causes problems if a character is going to be ingame i dont personally care who owns it  the actual character itself had the same chances to develop as mine did  and unless its deleted or unsubbed its going to be ingame anyway why does this feature use plex and not an existing reward or trade system from ingame i dont see why it couldnt be tied to a lp reward or somesuch which would also remove the benefit people have with buying isk with plex this along with the fact that ccp specifically stated that there would be no microtransactions gives rise to peoples fear although i agree that the actual use of this feature could be low and some people are over reacting  but a line must be drawn somewheresaying all that i dont think there should be an increase in remapping at all we already have enough of them and this is one of my main reasons i am against this featurethink about your training plan and what you want to do in gameplan aheaddont touch your remaps when you are drunk tripping or wastedsuffer the consequences for failing to do any of the above this is eve grow some balls and suck it upon another note great layout of your proposal and i wish everyone else posted their proposals like thistamber
take a good long look at how many people support this so called stupid idea and how many are opposed to this ideayeah waste of time to even bother askingf node and company are only scratching the surface herekeep on coming up with excuses to support this ludicrous idea not going to win any points with that mob standing over there
why once a year why not make it a one time event once every two years once every five years this is not wow or korean why not once a dayand why is neural remapping once a year freeif theyre gonna do it then do it through game mechanics not plex and then make sure theres a cost associated neural remaps appropriate to the advantage of doing it
it should be done through game mechanics not through what size wallet you have outside the gameits bad enough as it is
it appears as though the two proposals against and for are a moot point for the moment and we will just have to wait to see how it actually does affect the game eurogamers robert purchese posted an interview with ccps eve creative director torfi frans olafsson on page 3 of the interview is the following question  answereven though i am for this feature as i stated in a comment in the no proposal i am not in favor of a cash shop in eve this statement by olafsson leaves a sour taste in my mouth as it appears as though there is poison mixed in with the honey

now that t3 ships are starting to show up i feel a t3 exhumer should be brought to the table i think it would be a nice fit and work out well for both sides it would add new subsystems skills and a new ship possibly new harvesters as well it could either be setup with subsystems for either ice or ore depending on which subsystems you choose but not for both so you would still need to have 2 t3 exhumers 1 for ice and 1 for ore would need the skills advanced spaceship command iii exhumers v mining barge v spaceship command v astrogeology v astrogeology upgrades i or whatever industry v science v mining v and the new spaceship command skill for t3 exhumer exhumer plus plus the subsystem skills maybe 3 highs 4 mids 3 lows 5 subsystem slots and maybe 3 rig slots could even add a new hardwire implant for all subsystems to increase sales there as well a few names ive thought of could be the corethe oreonthe triafeel free to add something or suggest other names thanks

i think we just found a good idea
supported so long as the theoretical peak mining rate is however slightly less than the hulk
nice one would be nice to have a boat that has at least some sort of chance to survive if some tries to tackle it
out of curiosity why
ive heard ccps official stance on mining ships was they dont want anything to outmine the hulkwhich is also why they havent come out with anything else weaker than the hulkanyone who wants to make a profession out of mining will train for the hulkand anyone who doesnt want to really make a profession out of it wont bother to train for anything lesser just becauseas for using a t3 to mine thats a lot of wasted effort training to stare at rocks all dayhence why all the prereqs seem to focus on being combat ready and why all the subs are focused around combat

this suggestion is very simple and does not require a lot of explanation what i suggest is that a new alternative is added to bookmarks in the rightclick menu which you get in space delete bookmarkif you think too many mistakes will occur because of this then add a control question which asks if you really want to go through with thissimple as thatcheers
good idea  supported
whats wrong with opening people and places and deleting it from therei have too many bookmarksso go make folders and organizethen you dont have to scroll through hundreds of bms to find that one single deep safe make a folder called deep safe and then you only have to scroll through those
oh there is nothing wrong with opening people and places im merely saying it could be made a lot easier without actually giving any further advantages in the game itself
i dont knowtaking a look at the other rclick menu arrangements it would probably readwarp to 0mwarp towarp squad to 0mdelete bookmarkwarp squad tooh and the patch that adds this function would also ninja buff your mouse response time so youre more likely to overclick
ninja buff and overclick no idea what you just said
well if you have close to fifty jump bridges bookmarked about double that number poses and i dont even want to count all the tacticals across two or three regions  it gets a bit messy no matter how you organize it and no creating 30 folders is not the solution either subfolders would make organization easierop sure why not lowhanging fruit they call it

definitely and please ccp dont place it right under warp to
lold when i read the op lold again reading it for a second time as i wrote the above
my carebear lost 2 tengus in a row to suicide and theyre both t2 fitted and carrying only ammo apparently they dont check contents anymore just jump on the gank whenever they can lost the 2nd one before the subsystem sp loss from 1st gank even finished training back up used to think suicide ganking as part of the game but recently this game mechanics is really coming apart at the seams there are sometimes smack in local not between ganker and ganked but different groups of gankers fighting over a spot
wrong wrong wronga already pretty high for poddings i had a 12 drop after a podkill on an alt the other dayb noc umm nod lul wutsorry but this seems completly rubbish plus u contradict yourself majorly its pvp game but i want it you cant pk in areasyou want concord to just like poof appear as soon as someone opens fire this aint harry potter where u can just appear concord has to warp in etc and tbh its fast enough they can detect an illegal activity an be on scene in like 10seconds
it only takes one volley doesnt matter how fast concord shows upyou missed the problem consider this out in lowsec or null a bs doesnt stand a chance against a t3 cruiser but in concordland the reverse is true because the t3 isnt allowed to defend itself by the time the volley came its too late ganker enjoys concord protection thats why they are able to do what they do it used to be the case where you can avoid suicide gank by not carrying valuables but ppl realized how easy t3s are to gank and pulls the trigger without waiting to check contents cant fight it cant avoid it
ofc it can defend itself if u gonna fly an expensive ship take some precautions have hardners on at all times etc dont ap get a scout if u have to fit a cloaky warp if neededand yea if u survive initial volley gtfo or shoot back
tengu wont surviveyou put a cloak on mission boat in highsecscout in highsec ppl are everywhere youre going to check background of everyone you seeproblem concord protect gankers you see them but cant hit them until its too late they only 
instead of crying about it which only encourages them set up an antigank fleet with good bait and a lot of friends to finish off what they startthe problem with a lot of carebears is that they dont have friends this is a game about friends if you want to mish in an npc corp all by yourself dont expect to survive encounters with people who gasp fly in gangs and have backupas for t3 being easy to gank i dont get it my prote has 7 lows slots thats a lot of warp stabsor plates in nul sec theres the interdiction nullifier and my tenguflying pals can tank more than i can maybe the problem is with your fit t2 on a t3 ship go faction or officer t3 is not the place to cut costs
partially supportedthe main issue with the current sov system is that its very much all or nothing invaders must win fights consistantly to take a system if the defenders win even once the attack is stopped and must begin againsov warfare needs to be a more granular affair with lots of smaller battles affecting the overall outcome and allowing an attacker to weaken a defender with persistance rather than a handful of nodebreaking fightsso rather than tie cost to the ownership of nearby systems why not tie defender bonuses to it measure sov in a system on a points scale of 1 to 100 claiming nearby systems and the entire constellation allows the owner to build up points at a faster rate unlocking new upgrades like cyno beacons at certain points levelsconversely losing sov to a hostile invasion will cause your points total to drop in nearby systems and slow down recovery now defenders have an incentive to claim these worthless systems as they provide a buffer to more valuable ones attackers have a reason to invade them and start smaller fights to chip away at an overall goaledit this also provides a way to besiege a region if the defender wants to sit under their cynojammer eventually the attacker will take all adjacent systems and cause enough damage to sov points to disable that jammer upgrade
i am not sure how long did it take you to make this up but you certainly managed to do a way way better job that all of ccp combined over the 7 or how many years we have sov
while your idea is certainly better than the current system i want to argue for the costs element a lot of what youre suggesting wouldnt be cared about by entities that large supercapital fleets or entities that have renters by tying constellation to costs you hit large entities where it matters as well as smaller entities whereas your idea would only be cared about by smaller entities that have little space by tying to cost it means that those entities flush with supercaps and titans will still want the surrounding space to keep spaceholding costs down it means that alliances are less likely to want to give space to bloc entities for jump bridges as it would increase the cost of their surrounding systems to have one system in the middle of a constellation used by an outside entity it means alliances that rent have to figure out a new model rather than just taking a regions stations and then renting out the region as costs will be far too high and it gives smaller entities the ability to hurt larger ones if you tie it to defensive bonuses then its still a situation where the superbloc only needs to show up for station defenses with a large blob rather than wittling them down financially
another argument did u even take any measures to protect yourselfthe carebears that get ganked dont and u wonder why no one likes or respects them especially when they refuse to learn from their mistakes and instead whine like u do
thats not true at all how do you know that did you ever see all of these suicide gankstry to operate an industrial ships heavy slow and nearly unarmed ships versus a gank of destroyers if you are the primary target of a fast agile ship with a pilot that targets you in less than 2 seconds you have no chance you are warpscrambled and you are not going to any place do you ever know how much time do you need with an exhumer to warp out even if you are aligned you have very little chance of survival yes you can set bad standing the next time with that corp and yes you can just stay docked in the station the next time you see this guys on the local waw thats really funny what kind of meassures you prupouse have a full army of combat ships with you at the same time you are mining sure youll find a lot of people willing for doing that and even with that army may be the gank will destroy one of theses mining ships concord react time is less than a minute an estrategic cruiser hunter kills these ships in less than a minute and the fit of those ships are nice for tanking u just need to see the killmailswhat im trying to explain is that yes of course you can avoid being a attractive target employing unspensive craps ships with crap cargo but thats funny are you really safe even flying craps versus suiciders that just want to hear your criesim just asking for increased punishment for concordnuked if concord acts is for something rightmay be you just want concord to disappear from the game and this just become an outlaw place where every one can kill anyone but i think many people do not like that kind of gaming i do not think op petition is versus eve philosofy why to declare a war if its far more ease and unspensive to suicide yourself with little or even no warning if you are at war you can see a enemy pilot in the local if i must think of every neutral pilots in empire like hostile i do not think no one will ever dock out from the station honestly i really think suicide ganks are exploits cheaper than wars unnoticed till you get target too late then an too ease to repaing the sec status and isk lost its even a way to make ease isks
i have a feeling your trying to make a point but im not sure what
i dont need to the mere fact that they were chosen to be blown up and it succeeded means they did something wrong therfore the better questions would be how do you know that did you ever see all of these suicide ganks i didnt think so 1 i have flown industrial ships but thx for assuming never been suicide ganked once even in a t1 industrial know why i dont load up on billions worth of cargo in it try to do that sometime instead of wanting your hand held2 any fast agile ship trying to tackle u would get instapopped by the gate guns and if ure not at a gate or station3 dont fly what u cant afford to lose no ones forcing u to mine with an exhumer or using squishy paper haulers and having to squeeze all your assets into it 1 yes its called protecting yourself something thats apparently too much for u to comprehendhandle2 a isk saved is an isk earned namely the isk u saved from not losing another exhumer like an idiot 1 that could work for low sec so its an option might wanna give that a try instead of whining some more2 or u can stick with a t1 barge and lose nothing so ure not worth gankingcare to link these supposed killmails where they use t3s to suicide gank and i do mean suicide ganked not mine like an idiot during war timeyes u r the ppl here arent bullting u and if u dont believe us try it whats the worst that can happen u lose nothing but your ego ppl dont get killed without a reason so stop smackingcrying in local like a moron if u cant handle the consequences and if thats too much for u then ure playing the wrong game thx for assuming again but i dont contribute to the problem by farming low sec into extinction nor would i want to turn high sec into low sec because it wouldnt work the systems fine as it is if anything too much in favor of miners and fyi concord is only there to prevent high sec from becoming low sec no more no less
1 war dec 2 mil flat fee per week against a corp no sec loss at all suicide gank 2 mil isk lost every single attempt due to automatic ship loss sec loss every single attempt kill rights granted to victim upon destruction that last up to 4 war dec periods obviously u didnt know something as simple as that and u wonder why no one likes or respects carebears like u 2 ull never be in complete safety even in high sec unless ure docked so if ure gonna be that paranoid instead of learning how to protect yourself its your loss and ure only griefing yourself oh no gimme a warning before it happens so i dont have to deal with risk for my rewards u dont see everyone else in local getting blown up left and right so get over it3 low sec pirates and 00 players have mining alts that stay in npc corps all the time so they cant be war decced wheres the risk for them when theyre hiding behind their alts avoiding the tables being turned on them oh thats right there isnt any1 if it was an exploit ccp wouldve removed suicide ganking altogether a long time ago instead of just nerfing it little by little so think again2 refer to the top of the post3 try and gain just 100 sec and see how long it takes u go ahead i guarantee u itll take a lot more time and effort than u wouldve exerted by switching to a mining barge or lightening your cargo and taking a few extra trips in a tanked industrial 4 then again if u wanna continue acting stupid and not learn from your mistakes then u deserve to get farmed for isk
anything new on this topic
agree with op
havent really read the thread so i dunno how youre preventing me from hunting myself with my alt i guess the random pool could be much larger if bounties actually worked so it might worksupporting anyway because bounties need help this would definitely do better than the current system
im not sure that the instantly proposed bounty system would be superior to the well thought out system already proposed by dierdre vraal some years ago but i would vehemently support either in place of the existing bounty system moreover i believe the bounty system resolves a gross inequity of balance between pirates and nonpirates pvpers and nonpvpers older characters and newer characters etcand if you want to throw this in i personally find the motif to be more realistic rampant piracy without substantial consequence in highsec doesnt sit with my suspension of disbelief a bounty system directly addressees that without removing the very cool risk of player piracy from the game the skilled pirates who are more than just pathetic griefing bullies looking for level 1 mission but level 4 payout easy money and performancetrolling lawls will still find a way to profit and plague the spacelanes
i mostly support this although i never thought to put the whole system in the agentmission format you have here most of these ideas are similar to what i would want in a future bounty systemit would indeed take a lot of tweaking to get it right but anything that makes bounty hunting look more worthwhile is good in my book
maybe an idea from someone tired to read local chanthis chan is very important for keeping an eye on who entered or who left the system so impossible to close it but the trolls get more outnumbered as the number of players is growingi tried to reduce at max the text windows but its still not suitable i would prefer to not feel negative waves from antepubert teenagers that have invaded the game all the day if possible by the way reptilians wont get any food  private joke sorryi tried to start blocking every player that entered local chan its quite boring after some timesso please majesty could you find a way for us to choose if we want to see the text in chan or not thank you
first
you can just slide it offscreen partially again now that that bug has been fixed so you only see the names couple that with blink off and you have your intel listing without distracting claptrap
as above turn blink off move the chat part of the window offscreen saves real estate while still serving as an omniscient intel tool
umm  not liking this at allalso  you havent explained the idea very well ie what you want it to achieve in the game role or any other information such as skills limitations etc
ormake the covops pilot the fcthen when he probes down a sig he can immediately gang warp everyone else
im fairly sure you can achieve all of that by having a cloaking probing t3 on grid with youdrop probes cloak scan ship fleet warp to ship
i think hes also proposing a new ability for the scan probes of fleetmates to be slaved to the control of a single fleet member that is 5 fleetmates drop 6 probes each and one person in the fleet will have the ability to control all 30 probeseither that or when someone in the fleet scans down something someone else in the same fleet automatically gets the scan resultpeter quixote isnt being very clear
wtf ccp no no no 
supported
i have no idea what is going on here im going to lock this
1 all the whining about a counter to cloaks no one realizes that cloaks are a counter to probesas ive said for every other afk cloak thread cloaks arent the problem they are working as intendedthe problem is players going afk all day longthere is nothing in eve that requires your presence but not player interactionif a cloaked spy is watching a gathering fleet theyll be chatting back to friendlies that alone signifies they are not away from keyboard those guys are completely legitif a cloaked ship is parked in a deep safe while the player has gone off to their day job for hours those are the problemsadd an afk timer like most games have and youll get rid of the scary boogeyman whose face plagues your local2 as for reusing the pos system scannerid support using that if it takes 1 hour to scan the system it only gets you onto the same grid as the cloaked ship it relies on the hunters using one of these to find the ship after that
not supported
if theyre somehow griefing u by not doing anything did u ever try ignoring them its not like theyre smacking in local and really griefing the hell out of everyone

i run the mac client and because of tyrannis 11 whenever i turn on my audio my game crashes at the peak of that acceleration gate song as a result of this i lost a rather expensive paladin and my petition was turned down even when i offered up video evidence to prove it ccp get your  together
can i have your stuff
bump for persistence warrants nonfutile existence
why not post a reason so that he has a chance to adress your concernstamber
since you asked nicely because he freely admits he knows jack  about the game or its mechanics i prefer people who have input however small it may be into things that may one day affect my game play to at least have some idea of what theyre talking about passion alone is not something i would consider useful in a candidateits the main reason ive never put myself forward as a csm candidate because i feel i dont know enough about the game
what i said is that i dont know  about coding or development i know plenty about eve mechanics
someone is already campaigning for the next csmsimply wowissler
ive never really cared to debate the remove local agenda but this has me curious exactly how do you figure this change will give your desired outcomesnot the obvious ones like more dangerous and more cloaky but this would somehow encourage small gang combat even if you look to wormholes as an example small gang combat is there simply due to mass restrictions not because local is delayed
simply because if people dont know u there they cant call the blob giving you time to do some damage and escape guerrilla warfare my friend
nice introductionand ambitious agendasince youve been playing since beta 2002 you must have some ideaahnung about ccp how they do things company culture etcwhat is your strategy exactly to get ccp to do those things you propose
you would do the same if you hadnt the guaranteed votes from some major alliance starting soon gives me more time to divulge my ideas perhaps giving me a fighting chance
my strategy is quite simple remind them of the essence behind eve hell i will even take my 2003 game box to iceland and read it to them out loud remind ccp that todays achievements  are own to what they once were
oh lookin addition to the most ridiculous patch issued since the bootini fiascoccp in a positive move is looking to releasedum dum te dum drumrollnew facesbecause looking good in a broken game is where its at go ccp and csm yeah
yes because its totaly the csms fault that ccp is starting rollout on a feature theyve been working on for over three years idiotoh and by the way the only improvement i believe black ops need is an increase in their fuel bay size other than that theyre fine as long as you use your brain when deploying them i dont think you will ever completely eliminate the need for a hauler to carry fuel and ammo but a increase in fuel storage might be useful even if just to increase their unsupported travel range
an ideaeach pirate that law enforcers kill adds to some type of concord bountyeach pilot that pirates kill adds to some type of pirate npc corp rewardreward values are calculated by ship valuemoddules destroyedpodkill implants to avoid exploits
and this prevents alt based exploitation of the bounty system how exactly
the rewards cannot be higher than the actual player isk loss
i would like to open the floor for a discussion of the collision mechanics used in eve online primarily i would like to point out the fact that a number of ships and other objects in the game seem to have collision boxes that are broken the intent of this thread is to both discuss the issue regarding collision detection as well as to collect a list of structures vessels and objects that do not seem to be colliding correctly with other bodiesit is also important that i state that this thread is not about demanding perfect collision boxes that match the surfaces of ships and such exactly instead i am hopping to gain support for a request that the collision boxes be fixed such that ships no longer may fly through one another or so that ships in a mission may no longer become stuck inside of a large collidable structurei intend to collect a list of as many broken objects as possible however any assistance that may be given by other capsuleers in locating errors would be greatly appreciatedthank you very much for your time fly saferobert catachan
broken shipshyperion bow section forward of the engines does not detect collisions at allbroken structuresin missionsangel extravaganza in the first pocket the large station has a collision box which seems to extend randomly throughout the inside of the actual models surfaceinfiltrated outposts in the first pocket the large drone hive has a collision box that can make approaching the acceleration gate nearly impossible as a result of this over sized collision box there are only a few paths by which a players ship may approach the gate this box needs to be fixed to open up the approach paths to this gatein normal spaceabandoned outposts seem to generally permit ships to pass through them with out any collision detection what so everstations generally seem to have collision boxes that are much larger than the actual station resulting in occasional difficulties aligning in ships that are very slow to acceleratethe caldari titan in orbit around caldari prime has a collision box that seems to extend many kilometers beyond the surface of the vessel the result of this is that ships are unable to approach it at all i do not know if player owned titans have the same issue if some one could confirm whether or not they do it would be appreciated
most of the destroyed station wrecks in deadspace areas are completely flythrough while flying through the inside of one really adds a sense of scale and immersion flying out through a solid wall completely breaks itin gurista sanctums not sure about other factions and many sleeper sites it is possible for your ship to partially fly into the central structure and become stuck there for a whilegallente control towers have very wide collission boxes especially on the part right below the hydroponic bays on the top making navigation around them difficult

noterrible idea games that suck implement free to play models this game does not suck just raise the subscription fee or something if they raise it 1 thats an extra 300kmo
fairly firm no herenot inherently against cash for cosmetic changes which we already have or character transfers also already available but against most everything else like name changes and the like especially against gamealtering changes like race changes sp purchasing buying additional remaps etcis it too late to set up a booth and sell torches and pitchforks
no hell no
i would cheerfully pay an extra dollar or two per month for each of my 3 accounts but ill never pay even a penny for a microtransaction item
depends the plex system by itself is a kind of microtransaction system but everyone likes it ccp need to be very caution with this changes and not giving any visible advantages for the one player over another its very easy to cross the invisible line when money talks
no
no
no
   no
no
no not even cosmetic
right there with you initially i was thinking microtransactions for incarna hats and shoes would okay sort of but the confirmation of plex for remaps shuts the door on any hope i retained that it would be limited to silly cosmetic crap no one would needmiss they easily can and probably will use mt to screw us over on incarna stuff just to cash in on a new player base drawn into the immersive world of eve now with dust514no to mt
ccp makes 45 mil per month from this game they should be rolling in dough and have plenty of resources to make this game fantastic instead theyve released a patch for their patch for their patch and what from the user standpoint did the first patch improve rockets hybrids afs poses treaties or sov or mothership balance no nothing at alltheyre ing the money we do give them away on vampires and dusti support the following transactionsign a publishing deal with ea for your vampires game to give you some money so you can fix this one before the tailspin becomes irreversible
no
while the crowd sourcing proposal specifically states more microstransactions the evils of plex are offset by the benefits of combating rmt and most are aware of the inherent pitfalls of this mechanic if you can please edit your comment to include your vote of yes no cosmetic please so that i can include you in the counttamber
noor as a wise man once said oh hell no
nein
no
no
no for microtransactions in every game with monthly subscriptionsif they need more cash they may rise up the subscription by 50 cebt or soit has never ever good for a game to have a item shop for rl cashovertime more and more must have items will be put in to maximize the cashthat is no propehcy but a fact from all the games that have itand itUFFFDs the only thing that i still in eve and dont play world of tanks it has rl cash itemshopif eve has something simlar too that its done for me with the game that i atm anyway not happy with fixing in 2 years dust etc cc
no
no and no i wont be buying virtual clothesbut they will introduce it anyways because microsoft is selling rccars for live avatars and people are actually buying that crap people are buying and rebuying map packs and are moaning on the live forums if no new stuff is released for a week i remember the threads in another forum everybody vowed theyll never ever use ms points for virtual goods all that is left today is a thread with the latest releases and how to get ms points cheap a business cant get any closer to making money out of thin air than this you cant possibly expect ccp to watch from the sideline not even testing the waters because its good for the game who is the judge of whats good and whats bad anyways the forums trying to stop them is just a waste of personal bandwith imo unsubbing the only message that has any hope of getting through inb4 interbus hauling service to 00 stations just two plex and you get your bhaalgorn out of enemy hands
posting in a thread that wont change anything in ccps mind also no
aw hell noif i want something in game i get it with isk or a careful application of lotsa explosives
noim pretty new to eve though but i dont even wanna see dam remap for plex
nothis is obnoxious
no godamnit
yes if it means ccp can spend the money to change their processes to prevent insanity like allowing the tyrannis 11 gui changes through qa that and the implementation of the first phase of the pi changes are as clear a demonstration of a development team producing poor quality deliverables as one can get if such low quality product is making its way through the game design and development of wod and dust 514 then ccp are truly ed the market will not accept quality that low and the almost immediate failure of both games will put them out of business permanently the real issue though isnt the poor quality itself  the issue is what happened to them to allow this to go live
no
no i just recently uninstalled team fortress 2 a game i had lots of fun with for more than 3 years after a real money item store had been introduced by valve stuff like hats that make the wearer invulnerable to headshots made me feel that all the balance in this game was lost please dont let this happen to eve
no no problem with increasing mothly fee by 11 what ever but do not  never every  bring micropayment to eve ccp is going to destroy the very best mmorpg in the history of online games do not do so ccp plz keep eve as it is  
if i had to choose then itd be no obviouslybut i wouldnt really rage if it was put in all itd mean is more idiots with ed andor expensive fits floating about in space its not like the richer eve players dont make more isk per month than most people couldnt even afford to buy with plex if they saved up their whole livesas long as microtransactions dont offer anything not also available with isk i dont see too much of a problem doesnt really matter if its sell plex  buy titan  hilarious killmail or if its buy titan with   hilarious killmail ccp does get more bux in the latter case i guess which is probably what they would aim foralso remap for plex just means you can train leadership skills faster
no hell no  no
no
cosmetic only
tbh then you can say that directly buying sp with plexesreal money is a way to counter ebaying of chars but editted in my vote cosmetic
noeve is a great game but what you try to do now is destroying this great game
nono monthly subsciption fee plus micropayment it just doesnt mix well
no
no
hell noeven cosmetic stuff is just the first step into itonce they got the fine taste of money they shure want more of the greens
no
no microtransactions for anything we pay for the game already via subscriptions
no
no
no
cosmetic
cosmetic
cosmeticstill ccp isnt there more important stuff do to
combo  partial yes partial cosmetic onlyso mostly cosmeticconditions1 any and all of those micropayments must be made only via plex in some form and therefore indirectly with variable amounts of isk  enabling anybody to obtain them without ever spending any rl cash2 most things offered should be cosmetic in nature but useful practical things can also be offered  as long as they do not directly generate ingame items with similar and especially not superior stats compared to existing ingame items and as long as they do not give the payer any ingame benefits that would be impossible to otherwise attain even if time was not a factor
nopretty much the reasons tamber listed in the op
absolutely noit starts with remap for plex which is an advantage and not some cosmetical stuff and ends wherejust no
editchanged my stance to nowould prefer it if there wasnt any micro transactions if they are coming tho i hope they are only cosmetic like ship colours and nothing else dont want to have to go find all my other pc games cause im not playing eve any more
nogo away with the sucking micropayment crap i never have played games with this and i will not if ccp introduce it
not voting  the vote is biased given the ops discriptions for the votes that are not his
no
no
nonot even cosmetic you want to change hairstyle or add a tattoo go to the appropriate shop in a station and pay with isk
noover and out
no
no thx
noi would say that this is the thin end of the wedge but were already beyond that
no
no
no
no
no
vote cosmetic  but we know it never ends on that
no
yesi see nothing wrong with buying remaps heck people buy plexes for everythingmy issue with remaps has always been that 1 year is too long awaits waves of grandstanding on how noobs should just plan properly seriously i often like to train a block that ideally takes several months on certain attributes but which never justifies wasting the entire rest of the year if the rule were once every 6 months the remap system probably wouldnt even need external micromanagment in absentia of said 6months rule i wholeheartedly support paying a bit extra every now and then to get some better training going
noone of the usps of eve is that every ingame item can be traded and is available for everybody through isk assuming that seller and buyer agree on the price
no 
cosmetic onlyi can accept non interfering additions such as skins for ships clothing and stuff in general that has no direct impact aesthetics can be fun though otherwise the answer is no of course these items need to be able to be traded in game as well
no
you do realise that frequent remaps for everyone mean that stats become irrelevant right
no  seriously doing that crap will ruin the game and it will only be a matter of time before eve is turned into some kiddie playground
noand remove plex gtc sell for isk and caracter trade for isk please
no
no
noplease dont do this ccpprobably every single one of us talked trash about some badly implemented feature before or some patch or lag but we still love the game thats why we are here thats why we care
no
no
noi dont like all the plex isk buy  sell thing overall microtransactions is too much i want to tollerate in any online game i play please dont do that if i look on these comments here  i think it will ruin the game
not if ccp caps it but the option to buy an extra remap a year is something i would certainly welcome
no no thrice no
it seems that ccp changed their mind quicklyscreenshot from june 2010 credits to dodgypastlinkage
nobecause i know the first night im on drunk ill be buying remaps like they were antimatter scosmetics doesnt interest me in the slightest so just no
that is assuming everyone has infinite money to give to ccp which is very unlikely to be the case if someone wants to hand over hundreds of euros to ccp so they can train at the same speed as me but in different skill groups or train 18 days faster than me over a year using an optimised perint based remap then i have no problem with them doing so
i wonder how long that thread will survive
yesthis game already has microtransactions might as well keep it going for the right amount of money i can buy anything i want in eve
no
cosmetic onlyi support micropayments if they help people to get a pink cnr i support micropayments to change an avatars haircut or nose im strictly against any micropayments for skillpoints a higher possible level of a skill or advanced equipmentif this is implemented in eve ill unsuscribe my accountsi left swg because of the nge so why should i not leave eve
cosmetic onlyif it sticks to cosmetic stuff i dont care if other people are wasting money
no
no
i support making eve free to play and charging extra for incarna and everything related to it as soon as we get flying in space fixed we can talk about that again microtransactions for reinforced nodes or bug fixes
yesif another revenue source will help with backend improvements and extend the longevity of eve i am for it
yes

neither have i but i guess you got my point
cosmetic only
i would have to go with cosmetic onlytheres enough shipsmodsboosterimplants etc etc to screw with the balance of pvp in eve as a relativly new player its daunting just learning all of the above aspects let alone adding more aspectsit doesnt need anymore esspecially paid benefits that would ruin the pvp ppl with more money irl gaining advantages over ppl who can only afford the subscriptionyeah
tf2 just did this no unfair advantage from buying items  snipers that cant be headshotted and valve has more credibility than ccpno micotransactions
no
no
no
why am i not surprised that the wormhole exploiting corp support micropayments getting ahead of others by any means necessary  exploits real life cash whatever is all that counts not player skill or hard work wags finger
no
no
no
no
no
nothere is no logical reason for this to be implemented other then bettering ccps bottom line for the shorttermi have seen many games fail by adjusting their dynamic to allow players to buy their place in game although the claim is to not change the game dynamic allowing players to adjust their training rate with hard currency is one foot in the door to the brutal whoringtodeath of eveif you want to make more money then draw in new players or sell some merch dont exploit your current players or you will find yourself without any
cosmetic only
cosmetic onlyif somebody wants to spend money to accessorize their char thats up to them but im heavily against the idea of rl money to gain further advantages over those people just paying the subscription
hell no
no   i say i like eve as it is in terms of money paying one fee and rest of universe is intime ingame plex doesnUFFFDt destroy this feeling for me but more microtransactions for items would do thatportrait changes and stuff like that would be ok for me to do as microtransactions
nothe stuff we have now is fine plex for remap is very not fine cosmeticsmaaaaybe but it doesnt sit well with the gameactually eve is a subscription based games your sub should grant you access to everything eve has to offer so nothing in game for micropayments please no
no
no
no
through all the  for the past 3 12 years i have never even considered quitting this game microtransactions would become my official protest of eve microtransactions ruin gaming as a wholenoooooooooooo
do it and i have finaly a reason to cancel my last of my previous 3 accounts too
cosmetic only
no
no id rather not see eve changed to be like many of the other mmos in which the player with the most cash has the most advantage
cosmeticactually i would probably be ok with the microtransaction line in the snow being drawn just after the nural remaps because its not like your breaking the game or gaining a marked advantage
noand not because i pay a monthly fee this game has never had microtransactions and to introduce them now means only one glaring reasonmoneythere is no other reason due to the way everything in the game is already set up all items in the game cosmetic or not are and should be craftable as it always has been to change that now is to create a money siphon without reason
noif i pay a monthly fee this should pay for all that can be had in the game if microtransactions are introduced it will easily just become a game where those who canwant to use more rl money get an edgecosmetic is just the start im afraid
no
no
yes as long as they include the option for me to make a custom one of a kind paint job for all the cyberdyne rd titans and super carriers sold
no
cosmetic onlyi want boobs on my harcore manhunk portrait
no
i vote no no extra micro payment
no
no unless it is for cosmetic stuff only
no
no
no
cosmetics onlyfaster skill training through modified attributes is not cosmetics or vanity item and it will give the clear benefit over other players
no
noto eveville
100 no not even the cosmetic since that will only open pandoras boxall hail to eve the only game worth selling your wife for subscribtion
no
no
nostrictly speaking there is nothing wrong with microtransactions if they stay restricted to little unimportant features but as eve is a business after all and thus subject to economical fluctuations i am absolutely sure that once microtransactions have been introduced they will be used to earn ccp more cash whenever they think they might need some ccp will without a doubt introduce more and more microtransactions and once this business model has settled itself into the mind of the community people will be asking for something serious that gives them more for their cash and and that will drive people off quicker than anything else eve is suffering fromultimately this will turn the game into a milking station no matter how serious ccp are now about their intentions its a path best not to start walking in the first place
noin a free to play gfame micropayments may be ok but paying monthly fee and mircopaymants for any gamecontent no sir
noi pay a monthly subscription fee so i should get access to all the content
no
noi would say cosmetically only were i not concerned that such a route is itself a slippery slope towards full implementation of being able to purchase advantages warning wall of textshould the game go that route i will quit i am a player with an income probably not unlike may eve players most eve players i know either are gainfully employed or are students heading in that directionthere there is kinsy jk 3 kinsy accordingly while i could purchase advantages i prefer to play in a world that does not allow that most games that implement microtransactions do so as a substitute for the subscription model the model is preferred in asia where it has been more acceptedoften in china the microtransaction model is implemented because the majority of the player base cannot afford 1500month so the game distributes the cost among different playersthese games are typically free to play and allow you to either grind or purchase advantages if you have ever played a chinese mmo you likely know what i am talking about to me this appears to be a way for ccp to force its player base to spend more to remain competitive eve players in what is an extremely competitive gameplay environment want t2 gonna cost you want a 5 bonus to all your characters ewar skills heak yah but it will cost you  sure you dont have to purchase a general 5 bonus to web scramble ranges just remember that next time that interceptor has you scrammed but you cannot scram it no biggie right wrong this is where the game will go and there are plenty of games around and i for one will eventually leave this game should we find ourselves in anything that doles out more advantages based on we already have some want a faction web buy a gtc with cash and sell it for isk they still sell gtcs right dont honestly know i was an avid daoc player fantasypvp and one of the factors that led to me dropping my three accounts was that i got tired of having to purchase each new expansion in order to have the most competitive armorweaponsabilities i was already paying 3x subscriptions money is not the issue really so much as some point you feel you are being bilked to an extent that the game ceases to hold integrityccp go look at daoc numbers now i admit the largest factor of course in daoc collapsing was mythics failure to address hacking cheats etc  save that for a different discussion  but still dont repeat any of their misstepswall of text  sorry  just had my second cup of coffee

no

no
nono
cosmetic microtransactions only no neural remaps or anything that affects sp
at first i was going to say cosmectic only but given how last promises of cosmetic only turned into neural remaps im gonna say a big olno
if its only for things that do not give advantages to any player over all other players so i say hell no
no
no
cosmeticat first i was a staunch no vote on this issue but in the time since then and now ive thought a little more on thiscosmetic stuff means very little to me at this point in my life and the fact that others might spend their money on this shouldnt affect my gameplay in the slightest nor should it affect theirs it will also provide revenue to ccp which i would hope would be applied to the betterment of the game rather than to pad the bottom line for the profit statementive even come to terms with plex for remapping my character is mature enough at this point that i can probably live with the remaps available to me without having to buy extra opportunities if others want this again its revenue for ccp that i hope is reinvested in refinements to the gameapologies if this is rehashing what others have said in the previous pages
no

no thank youi would say cosmetic only but as others have stated that would open pandoras box so no

cosmetic only
cosmetic onlyto get a leg up in this game you have to be smartersneakierfastermore charismatic or more importantly a damsite luckier than the other guy not by having deeper pocketsif someone wants a pink glittery ship then im happy to see the owners of my favorite game profit over it as long as it doesnt affect my ability to kill them
noeve is a competitive game at heart and that needs a level playing field at the core to function the field is already uneven thanks to the existing rmt methods but to throw out all semblance of trying to maintain that field from the game environment side would destroy the vital competitive aspects that makes eve attractive and different from the mass of unremarkably dull mmos out there
cosmetic only
yesyea boyyeee
its gonna happen people its revenue csms posting no is laughable because you guys are uselss anyway so you can easily be ignoredthis is a profit opportunity that ccp will sieze up as a business they should absolutely go that direction even against the 1 of people who post in the forums and promise to ragequit sorry its going to be a business decision with little consideration from the player communityveteran people will moan and whine only because it wasnt afforded to them get over yourself it presents an opportunity for revenue and its an opportunities to get friends into the game ramped up and sucked into the mmo like the rest of us its gonna happen deal with itcheers
supported though this thread is probably just a joke to ccp at this point
one could argue emphatically that the blind eye turned to the font issues detailed here is a rabid seething wound an insult de force to all the ccp men and women who have worked so hard to build the fantastic ship graphics that are so visually stunning at higher resolutions none of their work is truly enjoyable when accompanied by the optical stench of such small unreadable characters this data these font characters are absolutely necessary  we cant ignore them they are the lifeblood of the eve universe  yet their useability has been compromised by a conspiracy of inaction within the very company that stands the most to gain from a final solution worthy of the fantastic ships that we flythis is not to say that action has not been taken just that none of the actions taken have resolved the problemand every other object of art in eve
this would be fantastic
plus juan
gust give the neutral rr ship gcc if they rep someone at war people pay isk to be at war so if they want to be involved they should join the corpalliance they want to help or just or just be able to watchbut hey this got taken to the csm in 08 and 09 and its still the same  so i dont think it will change ant time soon ccp wont want to lose money on alts
i have better idea lets increase dmg by 1000 and reduce optimal to 01km with 01km falloff and lets replace name of such turret from blaster to bump of doom
ok then if you have a dagree in math what would you say is a better formula i as well as every blaster boat pilot would love to read it if your going to hate on the formula im using why dont you show meus a better one instead of just say how bad mine is
thanks you people please pass the word around some more
agreed on all counts eve has such beautiful potential and now with the new characters we see just how glaringly bad some aspects lookparticularly the damn clouds that are so fricken bright my screen basically goes white might just be me colorblind pod pilot that i am

excellent idea
this could have the potential to break the game
as far as i see this just allows you to reallocate your skill points it doesnt seem to give a person any more skill points than they previously had there is no boost whatsoever given to anybody who does this other than how their skill points are distriubutedi think it is kind of dumb that it costs plex instead of isk but plex really is isk anyway so even that doesnt really even matter so what is the big dealor am i misunderstanding something hereedit and when i say skill points i am actually talking about attribute points as that is what a neural remap is not the actual skill points gained from training a skill
wtf ccp not on your nelly plexes have already totally devalued isk ingame and ruined the economy i guess you could go the whole hog and speed up eves demise with this latest kick in the spheriodssigned if you wanna be free to play be free to play if you wanna be a real mmorg drop this frankly stupid idea and maybe rethink the real world money for isk market youve condemned in one breathe and blown totally out of proportion with plexesseriously this is a phial to fartc

toasting bread epic1
wtf ccp
disapprove
supporting because i think its a stupid idea but some of you emo doomsayers need to take a breath and think about this if you optimize your attributes for your training plan every year and then somewhat stick to it the actual sp difference from changing attributes every time you change skills is negligable this really just allows people to chase after their sp butterflies mid training plan and possibly recover earlier from a derp derp remaphowever i think that this sort of thing will end up opening doors to a lot of other features for rl moneytldr i think its a dumb idea but you emo s are seriously blowing this out of proportion
hell no this is not a facebook game for crying out loud this is a terrible idea
please dontmany of us have put in years of patient work
i have always been telling the world about eve only game i ever felt to have the spirit care and support to its players since 2004 when i created first character vladimir ilich i have been lured to this amasing world of pure gaming and wits its strength is massive comparing it to other mmorpg products is unimmaginable it doesnt even stand to the critteria of product as this is a gift to us the playersnow when i ve heard the consideration of implementing an option to upgrade gameplay with real cash which is supported by game developers in this case the plexremap case i must say that it absolutely will cripple if not kill exaust the spirit of eve and his maker the ccp which i ve always talked of with awe to my brother while truing to lure him to play it and the other people nowdays all i see is games who profit from such operations and i cannot deny ccp would be wise to follow and fight to take the milk from the cow everybodys been milking so hard earn more cash to support even further their progres with dust and bloodlines game they are working on but the price to such actions is the one which players of eve will be paying not just loosing players faith but also shattering our and mine firm stand when we say eve  online is the best game ever to be and has incredible developer support hell sometimes i catch myself thinking what the hell i am doing in this game so long and get bored from time to time but then i think about the ccp and their care to this game like its a rare and valuable flower just cause of that i decided to fly the vast reaches of space as long as ccp and eve exist i must say that weather you decide to make the first step towards the milking cow or not i will not leave the game i loved so much but to whom i am going to tell now of the great and absolute flawless game of eve and its developer ccp petturson and the crew decide
when i first joined eve they preached time based skilling to level the playing field between the weekend warrior and hardcore nolifers i would like ccp to then justify that being the philosophy they built theyre entire revolutionary skilling structure around how that is in any way different than giving an advantage to those who see the subscription and 20 plexs a month as a drop in the bucket over those who are scraping or grinding every month to keep playing ccp is asking its subscribers to resign themselves to the fact that someone who started the game at the same exact time will have millions more skillpoints than them at 6 months of gameplay because the other person has more 0s at the end of their bank account and there is virtually nothing that person can do about it thats not to mention the people who have been around for 5 6 7 years now only to see all their money and countless hours viewed as wasted because someone welloff can achieve the same thing in 34 or less of the time to end my soapbox soliloquy if they change this i probably wont walk away at least not at first but some will and the next outrageous change some more will but to ccp this is balanced by the increase they see in plex sales and new subscribers and new accounts who are drawn in by the prospect of faster gratification for a few extra bills all that being said ccp you have shown us you can disregard our petitions like this one and raging to fix ongoing and longstanding issues or to not implement unwanted changes regardless of the support they recieve now prove to us you have grown large enough to completely turn your back on your core membership and the people who made you what you are todaysigned
i agree that this is the first step in the wrong direction in and of itself its fairly minor but it starts with remaps then what a collectors ship ie zephyrs and that turns into faction shuttles and then faction frigates and then youre buying sp on double plex weekends while you wait for the titan sale next weekreturn to the days where players actually influenced the game just checked the for thread still on first page vs this one alreayd at 31 and growing in the time that it took me to scan over one other thread clear player majority in opinion
by reallocating attributes at your discretion you can if you train the skills based on the attributes youve now paid iskmoneybought plex which if you pay for the reallocation only makes sense that you do train optimally for every skill that fits the allocation youve picked doing so repeatedly means you train faster than someone who only remaps per their yearly allocation and trains all the skills that fit the remap less likely as priorities change and it isnt always possible to only train skills that fit your optimal remap setup when comparing the two characters the one that remapped every time they trained skills with different primary and secondary attributes they come out with more sp than the player who trained mostly if all the skills for their single remap the end result is two fold more sp for the remapping fiend and potentially a faster road to an overall goal like say being a very good stealth bomber pilot and explorer vs the other character that trained primarily one type of skill with a few others tossed in out of needdesire that didnt fit the original remap they might have to wait to train optimally for additional skills or train them at a diminished rate depending on the initial remapplex isnt isk it is cash every plex that exists came into being because someone paid 175 us for it it is truly pay to gain an ingame feature that you already have access to at a regular schedule the fact that they now greenlight us paying for things our normal subscription allows us to have as an extra is part of the issue how about you use a plex to get jump clones when you have no standing or you use a plex to get a training bonus for 1 million sp if you or someone else is willing to spend the cash you can overcome game constraints to get ahead it isnt about earning or actually being better than others more clever etc it is about if you have extra cash to toss at ccp for benefits aka bribing them plex does the same but at least it combats isk sellers who would abuse ccps product using macros to artificially create isk through methods normal players wouldnt do at the same rate 237 mining mission running or by hacking player accounts and stealing their isk this feature isnt something ccp has any competition with a 3rd party they are doing it simply to make more  so why not sell sp for  why not sell ships for  why not sell soverignty for

wtf ccp
i say no like wtf going in the wrong direction
blablabla that said blablablaread as we going to do it anywaysthis is not good
lots of people have already said more or less what i think of this im definitely against remaps for plex
wtf ccp
why not try increasing revenue thru new accounts by fixing ur stupid broken game instead of this idiocy it seems like youve just given up ccpthis is the thin end of the wedge  stop before its too late
never ever dare wtf ccp building a good game and now trying to destroy it by urself oo
i have to admit id be the first one to use this feature if it were available but i still think its wrong and i support this thread
another bs from ccp
what is next custom colors for ships
no to any type of microtransaction
there is allwys some dumbass in a great corp who comes with crappy ideas ccp  let the ppl decide i would like to think that eve will remain the same considering skilltraining and other character based modsif i would like to learn faster i could just start playing wow damn
no to unfair advantages will ccp ever listen to its client base no clients no business hence we are stake holders in business one does not work without the otherwe will evolve just like everyone else we will certainly not become a dinosaur that has not been our style is this an excuse to do anything and everything if we as customers stopped paying you would you listen how do you not know that at some point down the track that when clients leave game that it is not influenced by such decisionsone day this will come back to bite you
im losing the faith every day a little more ccp
dont start that kind of sht ccp
no to micro transactions its a disgusting idea designed to milk the players for even more money are not the monthly fees we pay good enough anymore you need more cash really plex for a remap gives a direct advantage to thoose who got more rl money over others
ccp just like most other gaming companies are losing focus of what they are and what their purpose is stop trying to impress your shareholders and stop trying to boost your profits with abuse like thisccp always goes on about balance stop real money traders stop macroing stop using pos exploits why because it hits your bottom line but when you introduce something that will increase your income to the detriment of game balance its ok sadwe pay your salaries without us you wouldnt exist remember thatjz
plex is not currency isk is currency you can already legally buy isk isnt this enough
this
no damn
i do not agree on micro transactions
reallife cash shouldnt give you an ingame advantage
i vote no to micro paymentsmicro payments suck  they ruin the game just see how fast lor dies

although it can be good and bad i will have to vote no for the greater good of this community
dont do it ccpits a dangerous roadalso wtf we hear about this first from a thirdparty website

just one small step for plex one giant leap in the wrong direction
plex for remap makes me sad 
wtfnono no no no noshoot whoevers coming up with these ucking horrible ideas
noooooo dislike to the power of n
wtf ccp is a really good answer
i will quote another guy from the original topicin a p2p game there should not be any way to advance more quickly than other via casheve has 2 unique features fixedspeed skilling ie it doesnt change if you play more or pay more and the size of the playground remaps allow faster skilling even faster than optimized approach and defeats hard work of year training plansi will follow this situation carefully lets just hope there will be barriers at least to moderate this potential balance breakout
not for plex thats the wrong direction
wtf ccpif you approve this im out of eve
horrible idea ccp
this can only end badly do not allow plex trading for neural remaps
supported not that this thread nor the csms protests will ultimately have any impact on the path that ccp has in sight
supporting
i guess pay to play is not enough wtf
ccp isnt pulling the plug ccp isnt making them kill it they decided to kill it because they made no money off it why should ccp let them or help them make money off of their app when there are other apps eft evemon aura iclone evehq that are all totally developed for free and dont have any problemsits not ccps problem
judging by the capsuleer developers statement this is another case of ccps inability to pull the trigger and make a solid commitment once again no surprises here
i loved the hell out of this app and i really hope that iclone or even ccp realize how awesome having all the blogs together was and develop this feature into an app yes i realize i could do this through a google feed or whatever i could do the same with news but i bought an app to do that for me too i realize that ccp cannot possibly just favor a single developer no matter how awesome their app is so i would ask why it isnt feasible to have a blanket authorization for limited profit of any developer within reason and subject to honest product development no scam apps either that or crunch out an eve gate app of their own certainly theyre within their rights on that id like to see the capsuleer devs get some payment out of it but barring that id love to see someone take up the mantle with a nod of respect to the first guys to do it regarding the naysayers i realize individually there are really no unique features but it was the combination that made capusleer great yeah any one could have though to combine that stuff and anyone could have worked to make it as graphically appealing and smooth as the devs did but anyone didnt do it these two guys didthey arent owed anything by ccp but if they put up an app tommorrow that did absolutely nothing but cost a few bucks to thank them id buy it just to give them props for making my game better
i really hope ccp reads thesefinding the capsuleer iphone app was a huge turning point in my eve online gaming experience suddenly i discovered unity forums discussions eve inspired fiction fittings whs and so many other things that an isolated corp didnt offer capsuleer pushed my toons to a greater potential and even inspired my purchase of a second account it provided growth to my corporation and in turn pushed the alliance much further being on top of all the blogs and forumsi applaud the developers in their decision to let go they have a life beyond the computer screen and if ccp doesnt see the potential growth of their game in a free app then im sure another game will i hope their intellectual property of such an incredible mobile platform that was provided by love is returned 20 fold in a financial reward these guys deserve a reward for helping build a communityif ccp doesnt see that im sure another company will
what if ccps goal is to take control of this type of technologyapp for themselves and not hire outcontractpay someone else who has no legal rights to iti dont know how real that might be as it has been ccps position to let playersfans do all the work themselves and get nothing but notoriety for their effortsi support the developers efforts to get paid for their efforts but this is ccps productip and afaik none of the other people whove developed sitesformsappsetc get paid by ccp or are permitted to sell their work for  seems like this is asking for a special exemption where others have not gotten that benefit if the developers want to get compensated for their efforts and ccp isnt going forward with contractinglicensinghiring them what have you the only option seems to stop developing or open it up for  donations if  donations are permitted and pan out to cover their costeffort then continue developing if not scrap iti cant support the ccp supportpatronage as i dont know what that entails or how that works with all the other people whove done work that we benefit from in the forms of appswebsites etc that dont get anything from ccp and probably never will
all this seems to do is allow the reallocation of attribute points via neural remap more often than once per year it requiring 1 plex to do it is nothing more than saying it costs 360million isk the current price of buying a plex or 15 irl money this really does nothing more than give the player the option to pay 360mil isk to buy a neural remap that is all it doesit is completely seperate from the already existing issue that you can essentially purchase that 360mil isk with rl money by buying a plex of which the feature already exists in the game if that is the issue people are having it is a completely different topic the topic of should you be able to trade plex for ingame iskso as i said before the only thing this changes is the ability to remap more than once per year
i support itthose qqing about people buying a plex and being able to remaplook at jitasee all those plex for sale for iskya buy one of thoseyes i know the plex got into the game via rl money but so has everything else nothing in the game would exist without there being a cash transaction at some time hello subscriptionsfor those that say oh i dont have enough isk to buy one and im too pool irl to buy a plex well who gives a  about you you obviously dont play enough for this to have any impact on you whatsoever
i fully support plex 4 remap  please do it asap so i dont waste any more of my time with this noob remap i did
i totally support it and think its a great idea ive only been playing eve for 6 months and did not fully understand the training skills mechanics at the beginning and made a mistake with my first neural remap and had to change to intel and memory to maximize training the learning skillsso now im having to concentrate for a whole year on memory and intel support skills before i can swap over to perception and willpower for drones gunnery and spaceship command i even have cybernetics at 5 and bought 5s to quicken the process upto be honest this new option will appeal to the newer players more than established players and eve needs to engage and retain the newer player base because without them this game will slowly diei personally think everyone should have the option to neural remap as he or she so sees fit and what is the difference between paying 130 mill isk for implants or paying 350 mill per neural remap in game you still have to fund it through game currency and people with rl commitments who are time poor still buy gtcs wether it be for new mods ships or implants arent these microtransactions as wellanyway the more options the better and everyone will have the free choice without there being a huge dramatic shift in sp distribution
i support for a simple reason it is a game lets say youve got it all figured out you remap then two weeks later your corpalliance breaks up and you had been working on specific roles for that group now your new group wants you for a new purpose  there are many reasons to allow remaps people can currently spend a lot of rl cash buy a fancy char with all the skills they want but none of the customizationinstead of opposing it because you hate rmt which i do as well lets discuss why we hate rmtperhaps it should be a direct pay ccp 330 m isk to do it and dont use plex just create a sink for money to leave the game remapping is good really you cant really say it isnt a good thing rmt sucks most of us agree
this is exactly why i posted my proposal i thought it was pretty obvious tbhwhy did they introduce this feature as a microtransaction instead of being tied to an ingame mechanicpeople were upset because they thought this would start us down the path of microtransactionsoh and look what happened lolstamber
not supportedeve is not a simple jrpg how can you even support this kind of development
folks if you do support this although as ive stated above its a moot point now please remember to check the support this topic box below your editor when you write your reply it is the second checkbox directly beneath the preview checkbox there are 7 of you who have posted thus far who obviously support this but there is only mine and one other thumbsup registered
tamber i am fully aware of why you posted your proposal and what your concerns wereare personally i would prefer they had used an ingame mechanic too and i was not without my reservations of this possibly leading to mts but in all honesty this apparently is not the feature that will lead to mts but is instead a product of that thinking already within ccps discussions the feature in and of itself is not a bad feature as so many have been shouting which is why i posted my proposalto be honest i believe this decision goes a lot deeper than most of us realize this is about finances for ccp with two new games in development wod  dust 514 one of which is a break from the usual for ccp in that it is both a console game that will be an mmo and tied to a pc mmo a major expansion in the works incarna that will eventually add a whole new dimension to eve and the ongoing work needed to continue eve itself and to keep it growing thriving and running as efficiently yeah big issue there as possible ccp obviously needs more money the player base subs have not been growing fast enough to offset the cost of development which is one reason why the shiny new avatars are appearing a good 6 to 8 months before the launch of incarna in the hope that it alone will begin to draw in those players who have shied away from eve due to the lack of a true avatar but that probably is not going to be enough and ccp knows that they may be a lot of things in some players minds but dumb they are not thus the sudden inclusion of plex for neural remaps and talk of other cosmetic mtsthink about it with a player base of roughly 330000 if just 5 of those players use the feature just one time that equates to roughly 28875000  330000 x 535002 if 5 uses the feature on a semiregular basis that is a significant boost for the development coffers if this helps to insure the continuation of and the growth of the game we all love so much then i for one will step back from my hate of mts and cash shops and give it a chance to work
i think youre conflating boost to the developers coffers with boost to improving the gameplay two things which imo dont at all correlate if ccp sees they can make lots of money merely by introducing micropayments instead of say polishing what theyve got until its so awesome that more people hear about it and sign up then hey why not just produce more of the thing that makes lots of moneythrowing money at ccp for making the game worse wont get you a better gamenot supported

there should be some ways to enhance your players skills somewhat faster by work in the game using months subscribed as the primary metric of how many sps characters have in the account is ok but hardly any lofty ideal its more a lesser evil choice going to a 100 advancement by pve achievement grind wouldnt be something i suggest but allowing those who so choose to leap forward a few months a year 20 to 30 hardly would throw out the primary time metricwisdom and skills are developed by time and effortseems to be a good role play and competitive mix to meand the game is nicely competitive between people with vastly disparate skills alreadysome vitaly important roles can be played by very low sp characters as i buy plex for 4 accounts each month with isk ive earned in game the plexes are phychologically no different to me on a logical basis other people should be able to over come their opposite phychological bias and realize that each and every item that can be aquired with isk in the game is essetially a micro transaction already already translates directly to any item or privalege that can be bought with iskthat should be pretty clear to anyone thiking about it it matters not if its a plex or 350 million isk that need to be transferred to a npc or another player to get somethingso to me it boils down tois it a good idea for players to be able to earn a remap andshould we keep the game with its economy at the center of allowing a sandbox of many different ways to earn isk according to play prefferenceor should all new things of value force characters to perform specific pve missions with untrnaferable rights to the price i think its a good idea to have a way to earn extra remaps and i really like the idea that the game doesnt force us into specific channels and bind on contact dynamics
my proposal would be the ability to select 2 or more items right click and see their combined volume m3 total either directly on the right click menu or through a volume m3 scale button this is an immensely useful feature that should have been implemented years ago and is perhaps just an oversight on ccps behalf but one easily enough remedied
give the option for 2 color combinations to every faction example is the gallente color scheme were stuck with this metalteal color on every non faction ship but the gallente shuttle gets a nice metalyellow job give us the option to use either on every gallente vessel not a free for all choose your own color scheme thing just the option to have two developer set color schemes you could choose from do the same for every faction it adds variety and at least the barest and easiest to implement version of a personal appearance choice without the threat of garish non cannon colors or added lag
i guess  to balance versatility and return ratesay that t3 miner would have 70 return rate of hulk but it would be really hard to catch with pants down in a beltif t3 cruiser has anti bubble mech why wouldnt t3 miner have for example anti point with infinite warp strength and can be caught only in bubbles  hic bubble  inderdiction spheresppl would actually jump around with it in search of rocks to mine profitable mining wouldnt be limited to owning  paying for sov space to see a bistot rock floating aroundi
there are ten thousand ways for them to make it mine on par with the hulk or slightly less and still be better than the hulk with the way they are working the modular systems it could be very nice or horrideither way i wont say no
ok that makes sense  so its advantage wont be mining rate per se but in being a more survivable mining platform i can go with that
very nice idea the new 00 miner for sure 
explain how are we going to pop such ship in lowsec or in high sec even with a wardeck since bubbles cant be used there lowsec mining becomes safer than high sec mining infinite warp strength is uterly wrong just give it 23 warp strength or bubble immunity you are offering 100 safe mining only chance to be killed is by huge alpha and since itll be t3 and will have heavy tank this might be impossible
supported as long as the t3 exhumer does not offer 100 safe mining nothing in eve should be 100 safe
not supported in its current formthe next gen hulk should not be allowed to operate in empire not exceed current solo hulkm3 cycle time exceed fleet hulkm3 cylce time when operating in a fleet with mining bonuses have a mining crystal bay be able to link and deposit rocks directly into the ore hold of an orca or rorqualnext gen hulk ideas are continually posted here take some time to reference the previous posts not really a fan of mining in a glorified proteus
topic reposted here
yup
uhh is he implying he is in the nc if so then we are all doomed
i all for game balancing but i also like to have some regions in 00 to be better that others so we have something to fight over imagine that all the region had the same isk making potential with moons and a mixture of all the different rats in eve that would be no fun i believe that with the current situation where some regions are better then others moon andor ratting wise there are more reason to have the fights going im talking about the big long term campaigns not the random roaming gangsim simply afraid that if we balance this to a degree that no region are better that the other we would get a 00 that would be more like hallo kitty online i personally like the fact that we can have large campaigns that could last for more that several months at the time if we make it so that every region is more or less of the same financial value i dont see the reason to do this yes right now some alliances and coalitions are in control of most of the good moons but it is simply a matter of the other alliances in eve to band together and take it from the current owners
i dont think that anyone is askin to make everything equal the thing right now howver is that only tech is located in 1 area whilst all the other moon types can be found all over i therefor think its fair to either shuffle some tech moons around or limit some of the other moon typesand not all or to each region with its own moon type to a certain area in doing so making tech not the only resource that can be pretty much controled by 1 partylike this there will be 2 or 3 regions where you can find a special moon type this does not only make it slightly fairer this only assures thet there will be more conflict as there will be more regions worth assaulting for the local resources so imo everyone wins p
get out of highsec
i know you think you know what youre talking about but you really dont stop uberfactionfitting tengus in highsec and maybe you wont die like an idiot on an undockalso nice troll op
you understand that the gank fleet is setup to die right they only need 1 shot and an alt to loot the wreck so there is your fleet unless you are imagining a fleet to take down a freighter or something which isnt really what is being discussed here your advice on fitting a t3 also shows you dont understand the problem or that is your attempt to push more faction fit ships to get popped and looted a correctly setup bs can alpha a t3 no matter what the setup barring possibly if it is setup exclusively for hp which negates its use for anything ie no guns which is pointless unless you are hauling bpos which can be done in any number of other ships setup as such
read the post again its t2 fit tengu with only ammo no faction ganking is such those days that they dont scan anymore just hit the trigger and bid their luck or the next gankers in line will get their hands on it
you misunderstood fit a bit of buffer and it increases your chances of survival by quite a bit pay attention to your entire overview turning yellow and turn your tank on in advance or just gtfodont fly anything you cant afford to lose suicide ganking isnt likely to change as a legitimate in game tactic you can minimize your risks with just a little bit of effort and understanding of game mechanicsall this being said i wouldnt complain about insurance not covering loss to concord but i wouldnt expect that to do anything to stem the flow of suicide gankers
you underestimate how paper thin active pve fit t3s are it takes only one arty volley from one bs to gank a tengu harder on or not its not a rattlesnake with the ehp of a freighter
i bolded the part that youre wrong abouta  they already did that recently and also made it so sec status changes impact the aggressor more if hes attacking someone with higher security statusb  they recently did that too decreased it from half a minute or so to what it is currently about 13 of what it used to bec  no they dont need to revoke the insurance for aggressors i dont care to explain why but revoking insurance for anyone who loses their ship is a bad idead  sec status changes are a sign of appreciation from concord for having destroyed an enemy factions ship such as sansha if youre going to remove it from nullsec i would suggest you propose removing sec status changes from lowsec as well since its not really empire controlled space either neither of those are good ideas
so where do i go to sign up to suicide gank gate and station lurkers for a fee where would i sign up for that database or mailing list that posts character names of suicide gankers along with a unofficial bounty youd be good for the isk because youre a solid citizen rightthose things dont exist do they you have all the tools in the sandbox you need to solve this problem stop petitioning ccp to give you balls or drive to compete
it doesnt exist because its stupid it takes half a dozen bs to gank one ganker bs but only one volley out of one ganker bs to gank a t3 cruiser even if you gank a ganker he loses almost no isk from insured tech 1 tier 1 bs and can dock up immediately for another one no aggro no sec loss no isk loss there is no way to get back at gankers because game mechanics does not allow it give up
heres a hint turn your hardeners on whilst your travelling and then the gank bs wont be able to volley your unless your  fit
hardeners are important too but i said buffer if you have to gimp your t3s mission fit a little to make it more surviveable then so be it personally i dont think you really have to if youre too lazy to do that then go buy a rattlesnake with the ehp of a freighter
one or 2 lses wont keep that tengu from being one volleyed by arty by a long shot any more and you run out of grid and your failfit wont be viable for pve trust me ppl have tried and failed there is a reason solo instapopping tengus are all the rage those days to a point where they would blind gank ones that ended up being t2 fitted without scanning because its so easy
haha you seriously have no idea how to fit a ship do youpicks one of the highest ehp subcaps in the gamedeclares it cant be tanked to survive a one shot
for once i agree with ed over there and thats rareeither there are that many idiot tengu pilots who dont know wtf they are doingor this bull about t3s cant survive the first shot form a gank bs is just utterly full of epic failwhose trolling who again
here is proof in cinema that t3 can have high ehp this fight came down to the freaking wire and i assure you we all had lots of ehp
standard active tanked subsystem tengu with a dc on has 17k ehp best subcap volley with all lvl 5s and hardwirings is roughly 1415k i believe so surely with your shield hardeners on as well you shouldnt be popped baring lag activating your modulesedit damn it thats the third thread in a row that i have the first on the next page and i didnt snipe
tengu has zero shield em resist and mission runners will be using specific hardners on kinetic missions using bonused kinetic missiles its also standard for the 4 lows to be filled by 4 bcs without dc for pve fit ehp  ganked hp there are too many clueless posts here we all know about the 700k ehp brick fit proteus its not mentioned because thats a moot point if you failfit your pve t3 like that a regular raven will blitz faster pve  pvp fit pvp fit fail pve and vice versa thats why all those ganks happened whatever you noobs think you know you dont

tldr reduce capacitor use on 100mn mwds by 40whyafter the nano nerf and in particular the change to warp scramblers microwarps never got a fair look atunder the old system it made a lot of sense for a battleship class mwd to use a boat load of capacitor to prevent it from perma mwd status but with the nerf to speed bs speeds got impacted heavily and could ultimately be cut off using this module through a variety of other means for the attackerthe problem really remains that a bs mwd uses an unbelievably high amount of capacitor that doesnt match its role battleships already have a much higher use of capacitor for guns and active tank so the unproportional change to the mwd cap use really doesnt make sense when theres no balance needed thanks to the nano nerflets look at 3 tiers of amarr ships for comparison at lvl 5 skillsexecutionercap recharge 46mwd capacitor need is 38so at 55 skills this frigate can perma run a mwd wo fitting any other modsmallercap recharge 97mwd capacitor need is 149on the cruiser class the ship requires more cap than its base recharge at lvl 5 skills but the disparity isnt great it only requires 2 cap power relays to become cap stable armageddoncap recharge 169mwd capacitor need is 594it requires 5 cap power relays with all lvl 5 skills to become cap stable this seems absurdthe problem is youre not scaling the mwd on any reasonable platform it takes an unreasonably high amount of modules to get it to where it can use a mwd effectively without relying on cap injectors the real issue come into play for the blaster boats because they have a very high cap use weapons platform and the need for a very high cap use speed module and they can either active tank which is also extraordinarily high on cap use or plate which negatively affects the mwd ultimately using more capacitor to arrive at the same locationreducing the capacitor use of a 100mn mwd by 40 would give a character with all lvl 5 skills a cap use of 3564s this is still a large chunk of capacitor usage and would make it virtually impossible to perma run an mwd while doing anything else in particular without any extra capacitor buffs
please state why you think they should be stable
posting in a stealthminmatarbuff thread
okay so one of the drawbacks with droneships is that their primary weapon can be destroyed or left behind this is usually not a huge problem in lowsec if you bring spares along in your cargohold as you can dock up at any random station and resupply yourselfits more of an issue in 00 where roaming gangs often have to kill and gtfo when there are no stations readily available for a myrmidon this is a pretty big problem where youd have to be stupid to forsake the extra 90 dps of the 221 combination in favor of 5 hammerhead iis even when you plan on using 3 straight flights of hammerheads iis you could easily end up losing all of them if your roam is busy hitting targets and getting out as soon as local spikesthis is not a whinepost about the weapon system itself but rather im stating some reasons for a suggestion allow drones to be moved from the cargohold to the drone bay to prevent abuse during fights while the the drone bay is being reloaded no dronerelated activity can be taken for a period of 2 minutes let those who want to invest extra isk into giving their droneboats more endurance on roams do soedit conditions1 drones cannot be reloaded while the player has an aggression timer2 timer of 2 minutes where no dronerelated activity can be taken
being gallente i understand ur grievance but have to disagree with ur proposed mechanism or at least the timescale 30 seconds is not a really long time for a dualtriple repping myrm fighting a solo target if said target was popping drones the myrm may be able to survive quite easily long enough to move a fill bay over again really not very fairthe transfer should either take much longer like 2 minutes at least or be cap related like onlining modules even then that might be achievable with cap booster so i dunno but ur proposal is really no good
not a bad idea in theory but would need to be balanced carefully im thinking maybe have inflight drone bay changes require a cap percentage in the same way that inflight onlining of modules does
fyi tier 3 does not equal tech 3
ask yourself what do they actually add to the gameas pointed out here arguably in a mess of words the attributes themselves are the problem and doesnt actually make much senseits not the attributes that constitute the strategic choice of what your character does its the training order of skills the attributes together with learningimplants follows after that choice has been made if not they are simply an annoyancei realize this is a matter of perspective but i do not see how the attributes really affect the game play in a positive way all it does is make players divide training into blocks and implantremap accordingly or hold off certain skills completely where exactly is the value added in that  especially considering that the choice still exists with the skill plancut that extra fluff simplify and sort this mess out for goodtldrremove attributes and all skills  implants related to them sph would be the same regardless of who you are and what you trainthere would still be the choice of what to focus the training onthere would still be a riskreward choice involved with using enhancing implants
edit adding content because i pressed enter instead of tabit would be fairly interesting if heat damage from overloaded modules went towards damaging hull rather than damaging modules themselves this would allow for prolonged overloading of certain modules if needed and provide a risk of destroying ones own ship if they did not pay attention to the damage it was takingperhaps if this was done nanite paste could be changed to repair hull at some slow rate still providing the same end effect it does now
the one question your proposal does not address is whywhy do we need a change from the existing mechanic other than it would be interesting
1i especially like the boolean system for the pilots tabdont forget importexport to file and being able to duplicate them
yes importexport should definitely be there somewhere and it should come in two flavors either exportimport a single overview setting or all of them at onceand duplication is already possible if you look at the second picture the second option in the menu is use as template which essentially means you duplicate it into a new overview setting and this works on all items not just the template ones
dear ccpthe tilde sign  and the minus sign  looks pretty much the sameplease make the tilde sign a bit more tildish make the wave thingie more wavierpros people will be able to differentiate between a minus and a tilde less confusion in chatscons someone will have to work on this instead of fixing bugs such as fleet lag random crashes memory usage etcthanks

helloif anyone here has had the pleasure of trying to take a station you have found that a few things can happen1 you bring a massive blob to the station for 6 days in a row with no resistance this is taking a big toll on your membership as it takes some effort to coordinate this unfortunately on the final timer the defender decides to batphone and blob the system resulting in 6 days of hard work with nothing to show for it2 the defender has decided not to defend anything at all but despite this the attacked has to grind hundreds of millions of ehp over the course of weeks to take over the undefended space3 the defender kills your sbus before you were able to achieve anything4 you have constant fights as you take the station down and eventually either take the station or not but at least had good fights in the meantimethe points that i want to address here is the first two i think its bad for the game the a defending alliance does not need to show up for days while the attacker is going full throttle and if they show up one day it doesnt matter that they were absent for the first 6 dayshere is what i am suggesting it will be a sort of blitzkrieg attack option which will be done by using a new type of sbuwill cost a large amount of isk something like 45 billionwill be anchored at the stationwill take 6 hours to onlinewill have very little ehp something like 34 millionwill disable all jump bridges and cyno gens in the system once onlinewill reduce the station rf cycle to just 1 rf phase in the structure which will be set to a random 1224h timerthis is a pretty rough draft but let me know what you think or if you have any suggestions
its all in the maths lar ii provide 800 hp every 15 seconds a single 1600mm rt plate provide 4200 hp youll need 525 lar ii cycle to fully cover for a single 1600mm plate 525 cycles is 7875 seconds 4200 divided by 7875 is 53333 a lar ii is only worth it over a 1600mm plate if you are to tank a meagre 53 dps for 80 secondsit does not stop here lar iis base activation cost is 400 capacitor units 525 times 400 is 2100 thats 2100 capacitor units youll use just to tank 50 freakin dps for a bit more than a minute but wait theres more lar ii need 2300 pg to fit at all while 1600mm rt need only 500 pgactive tanking is flat out pointless please boost local reps to better than wtflol levels of efficiency
ive seen quite a few tripple repairer trippledouble booster myrmidons that did fine in small scale pvpive seen many hyperion that did the same thing even with neuts if you cycle boosters and repairers well youll be fineive seen and used active shield tank cyclone xlarge booster there is a nice video with one that kills solo 4bc i thinkabove post need to include ressistances if he wants real tank and not some random valueslocal reps are not intented to be for fleet engagements hint hint logistics hint hint remote reps are intented to be for fleet engagementsnot supported i dont think any of those need buff
not supported the cap booster is an effective countermeasure to the neut as are tactics that keep you out of neut range
im dubious about any fix that is based simply on changing costs eve has proved repeatedly that ccp does not plan game mechanics around inflation just looking at the supercap proliferation shows there is enough isk floating around the majority of 00 alliances to make sov costs a nonissuei can tell you right now that my alliance spends far far more on pos fuel or ship reimbursments than sov costs increasing sov costs to make the constellation discount worthwhile would only hurt smaller entities trying to claim their own space larger groups will barely noticeconsider this example a major alliance takes sov in a whole constellation with 7 systems and 3 stations with your proposed cost changes this will cost around 5bn per month assuming average upgrades a 5 discount on this drops the cost to 4750m that 250mmonth saving does not even cover the additional cost of owning the 4 nonstation systems let alone provide much incentive to defend them major alliances can quite easily throw away that 250m every day and not notice a dent in their finances theyre not going to blink at losing their quarter bil a month discountany system tied to cost will always benefit the ones with the most cash if you want smaller entities to be able to make larger ones take notice the best way is to allow them to negatively affect the defender sov mechanics themselvesmy idea can be extended to do this a couple of the most obvious ideas include tying ihub use to sov level if a system is brought below say 7 points by attacking the worthless systems nearby the ihub simply goes offlineanother alternative is to tie the reinforce timer variance to upgradessov level a heavily invested core system may have a 23 hour variance on its timers but outlying ones with minimal infrastructure have a much higher 68 hour variance making them far more vulnerablesmaller groups will be able to damage the larger alliances by going for these outlying targets weakening defenses for the overall area the more edge systems are broken the harder it gets to defend central ones

we already have hookers found in mission brothelput them to good usei
seriouslythere are hundreds of thousands of subscibers who like the way eve is now they like the fact that unlike so many other games you are never truly safe if someone is willing to put the resources toward ruining your day they also like laughing at people like you when you come on to the forums and go baaaaaawwwwwwwww this game isnt how i want it fix it for me naow like youre somehow more important than every other subscriberstop trying to change what makes this game unique because youre not smart enough or too lazy to protect yourself biomass your char go outside once in awhile and start looking for a game thatll touch your  stick its finger up your ass and tell you how pretty you are thats obviously what youre looking for and it isnt here
since when do you get gcc while fighting in wspace if you mean the normal 15 minute timer you stay in space if you log off in or immediately after combat thats a different mechanic and there to prevent logoffskis
phelzier please read the sticky topic hot topics of the assembly hall this idea has been submitted several times has links up and has been submitted to ccp as an issue
fixing the collision boxes we will cause the lose of those beautiful and surreal moments that occasionally happen upon undock but if they have to go could we not have real collisions as i long for the magical phrase ramming speed to have true meaning in eve apart from its possible sexual connotations
ramming speed wont come until after a lot of changes occur one huge one would be squad warp specifically in regards to capitals honestly not high on the list of things that need work
while i do find the previous opinions interesting and i do actually agree with collision damage assuming we can get a better manual flight system please do not confuse my intent in creating this thread requesting that ship collisions result in damage being taken by the ships involved is not in the scope of this discussionthis thread is for the discussion of broken collision boxes on various objects found in the eve universe broken collision boxes are defined here as being collision boxes that cause a significant graphical issue whether through severe clipping or by preventing vessels from approaching as closely as they should be able tothe current system of modeling vessels collision boxes is not actually broken it merely needs a few patches to prevent hyperion battleships from eating smaller ships and to prevent objects from bouncing ships at extreme distancesthe current system seems to use cylinders spheres and a few other polyhedrons for defining the collision boxes of objects in space the trouble is that for the hyperion the cylinder seems to only extend along half of the length of the ship i would only request that these issues be fixed to prevent these problems from recurring in the futurerobert catachan
updated october 7 added in microtransactions threadnaught
that ment nothing to ccp
bump
no
no
no
if it would mean buying stuff better ships implants or equipment that is otherwise through other ingame means unavailableby all means nounless it is a pink zealot
no this is not the way to go this will take away the only thing left of value in this game wich is skill points
nodont kill eve by making the most important ingame ability how much real money you havepeople can already trade plex for isk to buy any item available ingame unique items as prizes for at and such makes them really unique as theyre rewards for actual performance skill training is and should be equal for all subscribers
no id say cosmetic only but we all know it wouldnt end there dont destroy eve pleeeeeeeeeease ccp let the console guys have microtransactions with dust
no
no
noive worked hard to earn my skillpoints
novote no  i think that because you pay a set fee each month that you should have access to all the options and features ingame that everyone else gets yeah i cut and pasted lol im lazyi do however think that plex would be good for using to pay transfer fee for character exchanges
nomaybe for cosmetics but really ill by a plex before every large engagement if theyll spend time on making it lag free or even less laggy i dont need phuking red tuck and roll upholstery in my ships or tats on my toons dont need roses on my piano either but twolips on my organ would be nice
i would like to support the notion of ccp totally screwing the game up far more than it already is
no
no
no
no cept for boobs plz
lmao noooooo
nolets stop trying to make eve more like other games eve is a pure breed and a yard of mutts cosmetic only wouldnt be too bad but i would rather not open this door you give somebody an inch they take a yardedit minor spelling fix
no
cosmetic only this would be for incarna and incarna only as much as i want to say no at the time being the benifits would outweigh the cons as this woudl be a good source of revenue to update the servers software and maybe expand offices to be more world wideps added to hot topics
no thanksthe next logical step after this would be an attempt to allow real world marketing which frankly would be the absolute end of the gameplease no
yesthat being said i dont care if they do it for cosmetics yeah to vanity remaps dude if you are 4 years behind me remaps are not going to help or even faction mods a fool and his mods are soon parted however i do draw the line at named mods and skill points those two not ever
cosmetic only
no
man i got so mad about this totally notgoingtohappen idea that i totally forgot my anger over three broken patches and a litany of features that have been broken for a year or morenice job ccp
cosmetic onlythe only thing im curious about is that if these micro transactions use plexs like the possible remap system would then would this not push plex prices somewhat higher
no
cosmetic only
no
hell no
hell no
no
no
no
cosmetic only
no
cosmetic only and even then no special items i could see giving people a chance to remake their avatars though
no  id probably leave the game if ccp allows you to buy an advantage this is exactly what i did and many others did when sdenternet did this with navyfieldif you want to go down this route i suggest you setup a separate server cluster
no absolutely notand for one simple reasonthis to me screams out that theythe beancounters at ccp have all got hard ons for wows subscriber numbers and all the money blizzard must be making over all the notsomicro transaction based features theyve rolled outonce upon a time i was a wow player for several years much to my shame and the fact that they added micro transactions is one of the bigger reasons i left that garbage dump of an mmo so heres my warning to ccp the path you are on will not lead to greater subscriptions it will just burn the dedicated hardcore audience who have stuck by you so longi do not expect things to stay the same but i expect the game to change not the business model that underlies ittldr dont be blizzard or ill divorce you too p
no
noit really is the thin end of the wedge  they already have the infrastructure to give out skill points and with a move towards micrtransactions in general how long before you start to have plex for sp they not be planning it now  but what about in another 6 months or a year
no
noplease ccp donUFFFDt go this way leads to the dark side
no
no
nonono
no
nopretty stupid idea
no thanks
noplease dont let them turn eve into some shoddy facebook space game where the only way to get ahead is to pay even more cash to get performance you should already have
i vote no  although in a way its irrelevant the irl rich people or people with access to parents credit cards can already have an advantage by buying gtc and selling it for isk then buying better ships but yeah its a bad idea to start letting microtransactions develop further than that
no
yesi dont care
no
yesi dont really see the harm you can already use rl cash for just about everything in eve be it a character account transfer portrait change or to get isk to buy anything in the game except a neural remap this step only makes sense you want to get that cap character done training a few weeks earlier go throw down some cash on it
no
no
noim not even in favor of plex and character protrait changes but they are a fact so i am willing to live with it
yes i want to fly a pink avatar with an extra large gun and i want it tomorrow how much will that cost me ccp
whats going on here well it depends whats your stance ill go the other way
you can already do this sans the pink i would also suggest fitting more than one gun it costs around 45 thousand usd iirc
cosmetic onlyallowing people to buy skills or nonvanity items will surely break the gameplay and fun especially for players with old accounts and will turn eve into a 10yr oldstealtheparentscash playground
no
sup dude you can already buy every item in the game with rl cash or microtransactions but awesome job ignoring whats in the game as so many posters here have chosen to do
cosmetic only
no
nobut this adding micro transactions could be predicted to happen when plex was introduced
vote nofwiw i dont want to see funny hats in the game either i think there are more pressing concerns
nodo not need this at all
no
no
no
no
no100 behind this no micro transactions the game should not be easier for richer people
no
cosmetic onlyand ugly ones at that p
nooriginally i was going to vote cosmetic only  but after reading others comments  it could very easily be a slippery slope plex lets folks pretty much buy whatever they want ingame anyway why muddy the waters more
no
no
no
no
noeve is supposed to be a harsh brutal universe where the choices you make affect you and those around you with this you have an option to buy your way out of a situation so you dont have to live with the consequences of your decision
no
no
no
no
noffs
plex benefit players who buy them with isk isk can easily be destroyed through ship losses implant losses etc remaps cant be lost and offer benefits more skill points which are very unlikely to be lost since most pilots are good about keeping their clones updated also allowing some pilots to have more frequent remaps than others violates the ingame reason for 1 remapyear ie more than one will fry your brain this is a scifi game and introducing game elements that dont agree with the back story ruins the game universe imono
no
no lets not ruin eve the way every other mmo has been ruined
cosmetic onlythere are already things you can do in eve that cost irl iskies id support those being moved to being able to be done with a plex as an alternative payment methodthey key here is simple no unfair advantage should be awarded through micro transactions
nothe conversion   plex  isk is good enough either you can do it with isk or you cant do it point
noas in  no
no waytldr no
noif you want a game to go downhill introduce microtransactions
no
big noi pay my fee i should get access to all content
no terrible idea
no
no
no
no
no
a better question imoshould ccp introduce transactions that can only bet bought with real world the only examples of this are character transfer fees and potrait change fees i do not support those because they are only available with   plex does no good thereas soon as they allow plex for payment they open that transaction to any player to use their game play efforts to buy the same with isk i find many isk making activities fun i play the game partly for that purpose if i could only pvp i wouldnt be playing the game but id also not be interested in the economy if pvp didnt give the mods and goods and industry chain valueand i i couldnt enjoy collecting kms the same way i collect iski would like an abilty to get remaps sooner than once every 12 months i do think that there should be a costbenefit analysis otherwise attributes are pretty much worthlesshaving a cost in isk achieves that my support for plex for remaps is a support fo a method for all players to get another game alternative i also support a change to plex for character transfers and plex for portrain changes
nojust in case that you dont understand it
no no no no no and no one vote for each of my accounts
no
cosmetic only
yesps tamber im going to be writing my business ba honsdissertation on mmo business models subscriptions versus microtransactions any information you have regarding microtransactions and the eve community would be greatly welcomed i will be posting questionnaires and asking for interviews from players at a later date i would be grateful if you could mail me anything you have on this subject that could benefit meregardsxadrik
cosmetic onlyi already pay my fee so why would i need to pay more to access more content no harm in cosmetics if people will pay for that but anything affecting skill points or the like even access to limited edition ships is a no no plex needs no point system or other options for use
yesyou can currently buy anything in the game including the subscription fee for isk you can buy isk with real world money by buying a plex so basically if you have a few hundred dollars in real world money you can buy anything in the game including new characters awesome ships the best modules faster training speed from learning implants hell if you wanted you could buy enough plex to aquire enough isk to buy allies hire mercs there is almost nothing in this game that you cant buy indirectly with real world moneyi vote for buying remaps for plex which you can aquire with ingame isk hell i even vote for being able to buy skillppoints for plex you can already buy a high sp character with real world money legally by buying plex and selling them for isk the only difference is that you can have all the skillpoints you want on a character that you create instead of having to buy someone elsesbut omg noobs might be able to get more sp than me they already can a guy that started yesterday can buy a bunch of plex and sell them for isk then go to the character bazarr and buy a 100m sp character then you have a guy running around with 100m sp that started yesterday big deal
no x2 accountsedit in my vision of a utopian mmo there are no plex gtc or character sales however i am aware that enforcing that is completely different ball game
nothis is a terrible terrible idea eve is fantastic but if they go the micro transaction model it will totally kill the game for me
nodoes it need to be asked probably not will it be implemented yes most likely ccp is a business after allc
yes
no
noabsolutely no
no i am tempted to vote cosmetic only but the very first item mentioned after saying it would only be things that dont give a player an advantage was remapping attributes this is not cosmetic  it allows purchase of faster training more often than other people i mean if they cant stick to their word even for the length of one interview do the math
no
cosmeticif people wish to pay ccp money that can be spent on fixing bugs in order to look slightly prettier in game then sure why notplex for custom paintjobs
nobecause micro transactions tend to break games in the long run its only a small step from plex for remap to plex for sp
no way
no absolutely no
no
yes because the argument for no is weak and fantastical
yes
yescosmeticsorry i cant say yes or cosmetic because im somewhere in betweeni dont care about remaps for a plex ive been patient getting my guys up to 25mill sp what do i care if somone wants to save a month or two while they do it  i dont think ive played longer therefore i deserve more sp holds any weight either  playing longer brings its own advantages besides you already can buy sp through the character bazaarthat said i wouldnt want it to be wide open straight up plex or isk for sp that would be going too far imoi really fail to see how allowing remaps is any more game breaking than allowing the purchase of isk via plex right now you can buy the most expensive  in the game if youre willing to pony up the cash that seems far more offensive in terms of equality than getting a minor advantage on skill trainingin my final analysis if it means ccp earns a bit more then that is good for me since it means more development etc i hope at least
no
noeve should be subscription only leave microtransactions to dustmicrotransactions trivialize the gameplay it has no place in a virtual universe like eve eve should be as far removed from the real world as possible who cares if other mmos are trying it out forge your own pathccp should think very very hard before starting down this path ive played dozens of mmos many of which were tarnished by microtransactions
no
nothat stuff is for other games which are designed around it
nobut tbh i fully expect them to go that route down down deep till they reach hell or the earths core its the new flavour of mediocre games after all and they dont want to be the dinosours rightgood luck
no
no of course not are you people ed
tldrcosmeticscosmetics bigger skill queue 24h things that dont improve you in skill  pvp is fine sp and ship stat improvements are a nonowhy i think yes is wrong there is nothing tempting if half of eve ends up being able to do everything after day one if they just throw enough cash at itat least now every player is unique and skilled in a specific way with the exception of the very highly skilled players but they earned their versatility over the yearsif you wanna be able to do much just go buy a 100 mil sp charactersomeone gains a character someone loses character overall character game balance stays the samewhy i think no is wrong ccp will benefit financially more money  better  faster game development in theory
no
nono nocosmetic only is a gateway to worse things its harmless in theory but how long before marketing comes up with incentive programs oh wait a sec
response noneiniienon

yes old was much better
oh yess please missed the old ones by a few months sadly
i would like to openly inform you suitonia that your attempts at deging dod have been successful i was in conversation with a pilot that lost his scimitar to your righeous crusade of undocking in a t1 cruiser getting into 1v1s and when you recieved neutral rr shooting your neutral rr pilots this would end up giving her a gcc and transferred that to whoever was repping her popping both their ships via concord this pilot lamented that your actions wrecked his interest and capacity to play eve as he had lost his ship and so his capacity to earn isk he is now leaving and will most likely biomass his toongreat job at reducing the player count of the game we are each trying to enjoy in our own way
what should happen1 neutral rr reps an agressed wartarget2 neutral rr is clearly no longer neutral so the previously neutral player gets a personal one sided wardec on their hands meaning that he appears flasy read as if he stole something for a week during this week they other corp may kill the neutral rr as many times as they like if the other wardec ends the repper is still red blinky for the duration of the week if the repper does more repping during the week the week timer is reset
great ideas hope this gets thrown in as i put out a lot of courier contracts
im all for making a game look more pretty and what not for the pc but for some users like myself who run eve from their laptop that only has support for shader model 20 this is going to cause some serious problems i propose we keep the current shader model support but add more options for shaders
or you could buy a computerupgrade your graphics card from something that is 7 years old and dont use the excuse that itll effect laptop users the internal cardsmobos for laptops support shader 30 as of the gmax3000s
son its time for you to man up stop being the one guy who is always holding everyone back and just take one for the team by spending a few bucks on an upgrade its still months before the actual change is upon us so even minor savings during that period will allow you to easily upgrade to a compatible system your current system is ancient so even the cheapest modern model should be a decent upgrade in almost all aspects
youve had 7 years to save up 200 bucks and buy a laptop that isnt nearly a decade old get over it bud
keeping the minimum low isnt holding anyone back ccp is still capable of adding more to the graphics while leaving the minimum just that minimum i bought this laptop 3 years ago also shader model 30 hasnt even been out for 7 years let alone put onto average laptop graphic cards being sold when it was releasedalso im not sure if any of you read after the title but i stated i am on a laptop which cant be upgraded for a few bucks if i used my desktop for gaming i couldnt care less about dishing out for an upgrade that would run me around 20 but to upgrade to continue playing is going to be a bit expensive for those of you who want shader 30 why not state why we should make it the minimum when ccp isnt pushing any new graphics out that actually require shader 30 hardware they can easily make that on the higher settings instead of forcing it to be the minimum they could also push the high settings to medium medium to low and low to gone make the high settings use shader model 30 required things instead id be more understanding if there was something being pushed out that they absolutely had to use shader model 30 related things
i hear hello kitty island adventure still uses the intial shader model release
another announcement today to protect our accounts and the only tool we are given is the antiquated password with the recommendation to change it often please support this topic and let ccp know we need better tools to help us protect our accounts
yes i pay quite a bit for my two toons i dont want to loose it just like that1
likebut please dont sell them via the eve store where you have to pay 30  shipment costs for a 10x10 minmatar sticker i especially like the smartphone app idea
if u wanna remap  just make a pay 400 mio isk here for remap and not a please insert plex here buttonif u implement this  feature it will not only crash the plexmarket  but it will take out plex intended to trade playtime for isk  and vica verca to  for faster skilling 1month cycle of remaping 1 year char with sp normaly a 2 year char will have without sticking to any skillplansigned  regards
definetly no to anything pay with plex first a vanity golden necklace for the avatar then a special implant just for one plexthe missing of a item shop is what makes eve better then much out there do not throw away thisresist the beginningsi would go fine with a remap for isk but not for plex thanks for reading ccp
wtf ccp are you crazy
no
supportedmicropayments even if only cosmetic create a two class community
what the  are you people on about what else in the game cant you already buy with rl cash other than remaps
wtf ccp
dont be doing it wrong ccp
this
i havent posted on the forums in ages but this definitely needs everyones support
hifirst time poster hereintroducing micropayments to eve online is definitely wrongit starts with plex for remap then bling bling for incarna clothes
wtf ccp
nonot for plex only i would be okay if a remap would cost isk but not only with a plex that is just milking the players and making our beloved eveonline a cash cow we all know how that ends
no no no
unique selling proposition  google it
no thanks
no to plex for remaps and a general no to micro payment
a line you shouldnt cross ccp
after reading everything that i could find about this ive come to the conclusion that the majority of the protest is either based on fear of change fear that someone out there may gain a slight advantage on them and therefore they are being treated unfairly or it is simply the omg stampede factor where everyone gets caught up in the push
youll not be able to afford when this comes in gtc  plex prices are already rising folk arent taking less than 700 mil for a gtc right now and thats only going to a lot worse

huh solar wynde jondo smith felch arent alts of each other atall eh 
not supported
jondo is a member of my alliance the other felch ive never met just because the names have an apostrophe in them doesnt automatically make them alts ive seen hundreds of such names so by your reasoning they must belong to someone with a huge bank account and a computer complex to multibox them all
lmfao can i join the alt mega guyedit  forgot the support
no thums down  just no plenty of reasons have been given by plenty of playersthis looks to much like a stepping stone to more plex transactions we do not want ccp should spend their time fixing problems rather than making more i would make a proposal for someone in the csm to slap the one at ccp who came up with this crappy idea though
it is such a burden being surrounded by people who dont understand that thank you for your compassion if only more people could recognize how difficult their ignorance makes the world

i would add a subsystem for gas mining as you need gas to make t3 ships so this would be a perfect wh miner maybe allow it mine gas like a hulk ad have a better cycle time for ice or a better survivability rate as was already said or you make it a normal ship and you need the subsystems to fit the ice or strip miners hmm anyway i like it
any more comments
c
5 instead of 6 launchers 3 instead of 4 bcs lack of fuel catalyst cap regeneration matrix instead of augmented cap reservoir and only 1 t1 rigor instead of 3 t2 are all generally considered failfit for missioning you get 600 dps with full set of 5 implants and large exp radius furys when it should have been 900 while having the small exp radius to onehit down to elite frig rats every 3 seconds without waiting for painter to cyclethe tengu popping method those days isnt at undock but redock undock gank can easily be avoided by instaundock bm they have a few bs wait offstation in line with a high traffic gate and shoot tengus that come right out of warp to a standstill one second before it disappears into station because of the docking process once the your ship is being towed into station message comes up you no longer have control over ship to activate any mods or change direction while almost standing stillthe only way around it is to actually survive a gank without relaying on transversal or activating mods meaning a high ehp passive setup used to tank lvl5s the problem is it gets similarly pathetic dps as your failfit cited here so no serious mission runner would use it to blitz lvl4s failfitting your tengu to this point or even to a lesser point by modifying a cookie cutter optimal missioning fit with em resist instead of mission specific kinetic resist and 4th and last low with dc instead of bcs means slower missions compared to a cheaper and harder to gank bs then there is no reason to fly a tengu at all
youll never get rid of all suicide gankers  greifers you will however be able to cut down significantly if there was a system of infractions in high security space the first time you gank someone it might be the usual sans insurance payout of course you get a security ratings hit and concord takes you outeach time you aggro someone in highsec you get a longer aggro timer days  then weeks and then months if you reach full blown outlaw status anyone in system can blow you up and get the 20mil bounty that concord has placed on your heada way to reduce your security rating is to wait an allotted time and the infractions will go off your record also raise your security status infractions would still be on your record though even if theyre not active and even if you have a great security status againthis forces the outlaws into lowsec where they belong however there would still be gankers that do it for the thrill
its called risk vs reward especially since 600 dps is more than enough to do any lvl 4 u wanna be lazy and greedy for more rewards finedeal with the risks see how that worksthe same reason u cant control your ship is also the same reason they cant shoot uits being brought into the station and cant be targeted try to gain some perspective and learn the game for once again all u have to do is settle for a little less dps and a little more time spent for that precious peace of mind with 100 safety u obviously value so dearly but if 600 dps is still so agonizingly unbearable to u then go ahead be greedy and ignore risk vs reward its your tengu and your loss
i foresee ac macharials and vargurs becoming fotm if this gets passedwhat the hell ill support it i like minmatar ships
this would make gallente blaster boats more useful
this is why you dont rebalance races with damage buffs when other things make more sense but someone at ccp decide the massive boost to projectiles dps made sense so balances like these seem to favor one race over another however it does make sense that mwds use less cap for bs even with this change its unlikely there will be any bs platform that would be totally cap stable with an mwd on without the trade off of at least 23 slots that would normally be used for something more combat oriented id say thats a fair trade off
to prevent the above posters problem have it so you cant do it while you have agression just like you cant use gates this would be in addition to a timer
eve chronicle the vampire guys got a fancy new drone in his cargo bay pirates tell him to jet can it but he decides to load it into the drone bay instead and launches it into combat drone pewpews them to deathfirst off i want this drone already secondly id love to see a reload ability as well as a damage display and possibly even repair ability in the drone bayas for some of these suggested tradeoffs i dont agree with cap cost drones are drones because they dont use cap its not like they need gassed up before leaving and i could see a reloading timer like guns and such but not something that takes all day
heyfirst off i am pretty sure that this might have already been discussed but i was unable to find any thread that had the stuff i wanted to propose so i am doing a new proposal for it partially based on a 09 proposalif there is already a thread like this or it is in the csm back please let me knownow the proposalscurrent situationi want to produce from a blueprint  invent something  research something  do any si operation with a blueprint i rightclick the blueprint select the option and have to click on a button to bring up the available slots there i can select the slot i want to use quick select by double clicking at least skips the additional button click to accept the selection now if you are doing this for 10 production and 10 invention jobs its a painproposal oneautoselect the slot with the shortest queue show the queue length next to the queue id but leave the button for people who want to take a specific queue or want to use remote research on a posproposal twobulk operations let me select multiple blueprints and as long as they are identical like 10x invulnerability field ii blueprint for production or 10x ballistic control system i blueprint for invention bonus points for nonidentical blueprints for production let me install multiple jobs at the same time each using the slot with the shortest queue ofc it is already possible to shiftselect multiple jobs and deliver them so let us place them in bulk too pleaseyes these are small things but at least proposal one should not take too long to implement and it would make life a lot easier for the industry guys out there ofc there are a lot of other things that could be improved with si seeing a difference between a bpo and a bpc without rightclick  show info anyone  but hey its a start rightdelagos
this has been suggested many times i posted a thread suggesting this 6 months ago and its not like i was the first person to think of it i believe that a revamp of the si ui was promised in quantum rise which was about two years agobut then ccp decided they could make more money if they would take the better part of their devs and put them on vampires and console gamesso this isnt happening for at least a year by which time it probably will have been suggested another half dozen timesgood try though a for effort supported etc
proposalcharacter transfers and all other ccp offered alternatives to enhance players game experiences should be available in a way that allows payment with in game assets as a way of getting that benefitprosall players with time to play the game could avail themselves of a tools that allows flexibility and possible enhancement to their game play choices  regardless of their relative real world economic situation players would be able to chose to realize the isk value of some of their characters and use those funds for the purchase of differently skilled characters or for use to purchase other ingame assets without the out of game cost the same way that those willing to pay additional real world money to achievethe use of plex as price for service is beneficial because it is a flexible cost item that mirrors ebs and flows of the economy and by its intrinsic value the ability to use another 3 players for 1 month is something that has and will retain a high opportunity cost to forgo character transfer should continue to have a high associated cost to deter frequent changes in ownership that detract from the immersion and roleplaying advantages of tieing a real person to character and the nature of the ingame cost of plex achieves thisthere is a high rate associated number of customer service hours associated on average with each character transfer high incidence of hacked accounts unfamiliar procedure for players etc retiring 1 unit of prepaid game time per transfer will at least show an accounting profit to ccp and continue some tie requiring that overtime some extra real  will come in per each transferconstransfers of characters will initially increase to a higher future plateau rate in general frequent characters transfers can situation ally detract from game immersion and social bonds between playersplayers with 10s of billions of investable capital will have a new alternative to scale their trading activities and become still richer without themselves infusing cash into the game and will have an advantage or at least crowd out those currently involved in that game aspect as a means of achieving a higher  to isk exchange rate than buying gtcs and selling plex  those players that need to use some  to purchase isk every few months to fund pvp losses would have an alternative taken from them and may lose incremental interest in the gamecommentaryif players are offered a growing number of features only available by additional payments on top of monthly subscription costs there could be large gameplay and immersion breaking resultsallowing the use of isk to pay for transfers via the variable exchange rate involved with buying plex would both send a message from ccp that all game play enhancements will be earnable in game while still giving ccp some external accounting based revenue by retiring future paid game time in return for the high costumer service hours associated on average with the character transfer process
hey hoeach of you that already has been off to sisi to check new character creation system have spotted that there is no sliders available for morhping the face istead you just pull wholes in your facewith this post im requesting from ccp to add sliders for this feature as it will be more convinient during character creation process and will allow to create nicer avatarsif you agree with this idea when simply give your support to this ideabest regardsmystiq
haha maybe you missed the part where a ccp dev said we dont want sliders we want you to feel like youre sculping your character
i disagree sliders seem outdated and awkward to use like controlling a robot arm thats holding a paintbrush rather than using your own handsthough if they do put sliders back in i would suggest keeping the sculpting option too for those who like it
well ok i think the idea is solid keep the sliders and also the sculpting i think that will give people more choice and you dont wanna  anyone offbp
and while youre at it post this in test server feedback where it belongs
i propose to fire everyone at ccp and outsource the support to people who might not understand what we are saying but atleast they are there to respond to help calls i also vote to ban tweetfleet and all these other stupid press releases thus forcing them to become petition staff so that there is a few more than 3 people answering petitions over weeks of time remember to check the box if you agree with meits time for the players to get ahead for once and double time for ccp to get blanks out of blanks and help the players
hellz to the yeahz
if your going to troll at least bother to use your fraking headoutsourcing means it will end up in some 3rd world country who cant speak a lick of english and would follow a damn script and not use that grey matter that people call a brain1010 trollif they broke it they sure as hell can fix it
wheres the donate t2 laser ammo for goodor the buy neural remap with cargo expandersor even the breaking news kestrel wt carrying 74 janitors dies outside jita 44
thats gonna be super popular pvp ship large drone bay drake like tank bs size comon  
i like this it would be good in highsec and nullsec for minerslarge cargo tank but low yeild for the same skills as the hulk  throw in some battleship skills too maybe20k cargo is fine if u only have maybe 2 strips and little mining bonus 300 drone cargo might be too muchwhy restrict to lownulsec makes no sense hulkageddon is a player event not a ccp thing it be so slow at mining that most miners wont use it and hulkageddon will still get tons of kills
i hadent done the math but yeah 5758 sounds anbout right to me and yes i see a need from somethign to be done to repair the market value of ice and adding something to use ice fuel would work though im not sure what that could bei suppose something new or increased useage on things already in game  or perhapse a mix of the 2 but whatever i can support this simply as somethign needs done and i havent seen anyone else proposing anything
there has been a plethora of improvements to the game over the years to a various degrees of success one of major ones was introduction of remaps clearly it removed certain depth from the game and made the whole mechanics easier i think the following pending changes should be urgently implemented the order in which the changes are listed indicate the timeframe the further down the list the novelty is placed  the further down the timeframe novelty should be implemented so here it is  without further adue what should happen to eve please do show your support plex for remap plex for sp remap plex used to purchase sp ships virtual underwear prostitues and drugs complete removal of learning skills removal of attributes alltogether all characters get all level 5 skills from the start all characters get 5 of each ship in eve from the start includin capitals jovians and gm ships all characters become supergods and kill themselves because there existence is pointless eve servers officially decomissioned and used as  storage onwards   profitplease vote yes on those changes  encourage ccp not to become a dinosaur
u mad brah
i heartily endorse this product andor service
in after captain
supported
yes
maybe
i am indifferent
there is no content in the op
noalso this is not a new idea
not totally their fault ofc but they havent been exactly all up in arms about it either as supposedly representatives of the player base sometimes a more firmvocal stance towards ccps workings couldnt hurt imo after all the csm is somewhat of a public institution or was supposed to be one at its inception
which still does nothing to stop a player podding himself with an alt and claiming the cash
what i dont understand is that jump and cyno effects has been proposed over a year ago and has 25 pages of support and its not even indexed yet
supported make them worth the investment in time and isk
the only boost they really need is the ability to warp while cloaked keep in mind they are paper thin so theyre not really overpowerededit they do need a longer jump range and a bigger fuel bay as for the covert ops cloak it wouldnt hurt to give it a try honestly worse case scenario if it becomes over powered they can just change a few numbers around and nerf it again
no is my voteid probably not mind cosmetic only that much though tbhif they would start doing it like with the yes option it might make me quit
no
no
noin fact absolutely no
no
no
no no no if ccp do this i will quit
no
cosmetic only
hell no
yesseriously tamber i am surprised at how much you are twisting ccps words to push your own agenda here very unlike you everyone is thinking this is the end of the game when in fact it is evolving it is time to separate the men from the boys and to be honest this is a good start there are casual gamers in eve and then there are those who are serious about it and this allows them to be able to distinguish that if it is via certain clothing medals ships you name it it should be allowedall other mmos are going by this model and ccp is wise to not be left behind like some dinosaur it is business and an appropriate move it is time to evolve people this is not the atari 2600 anymore time to get with the times alreadyfor those poor people you already get free expansions if you are not super terrible at this game you can make enough isk to play for free anyways what is your problem what do you want the rich to pay you to play or something so sorry but welcome to life adapt or die alreadymicrotransactions plex for remap is not a microtransaction anyways it is an ingame item traded for another ingame mechanic you could blow up an unlucky cyno kestrel and viola you have seventyfour neural remaps how much real money did you pay for that noneso many butt hurt bitter vets worried about younger players having a change you super elitist pricks need to chill out and let others players have fun it is a game it should be fun
no
nonohell nonotnonixnay on the ansactionstra
same
i dont know whether youre an alt a troll or just that naive id have to guess though by your casual and obvious misrepresentation of ingame knowledge that youre a trollfor the wider audience the argument isnt about the possibility of newcomers catching up with veteran players ccp has all ready started to take actions to help newcomers and they have recieved much less resistance than this the revamping of the character creation the double training time to new players and the ongoing possibility of removing the barrier of training skills all of these serve better to level the playing field between new and oldhonestly i dont see what the major offense is in veteran players having some leeway is anyways beyond the early initial period of training the base fitting and weaponry skills up the primary advantage of veterancy is variety instead of sheer power you dont spend that much more time in this game getting skilled up than you do getting leveled and geared in any other mmo ive played which are many in numberno the primary concern with this move is the possible repercussions down the line microtransactions rarely stop at the first step plexforremap all ready gives a much more tangible benefit than would be considered a vanity item people are legitimately concerned that they or their organization would be unable to compete due to the influence of real world income a factor that many people have very little control overthe fact that people with more freetime than income can pay for their account is nice the ability for a person with more income than freetime can afford to buy useful ships in game is relatively benignthe idea my competition might be able to simply buy his way to victory in the future through microtransactions is insulting this is still a game and one that i pay to play real world income shouldnt dictate any measure of success in an environment that is supposed to be cathartic
noeither you charge monthly or for items not both
noin the day when youll start selling sp related stuff ill quit eve
short answer nolong answer nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
no the thread is filled with numerous sound and well stated reasons why its a bad idea to let people buy things that might give them an advantage let us hopeccp listens eh
no no no no no no no no no no no nodammit ccp are you just trying to make us all hate your decisions
no
nei  icelandic for nounfortunately my decision to leave the game has already been made is it because of this some but mostly with other things that are broken in the game this topic is not even in my top five reasons for leaving the game but it is a contributing factor my last account expires within a couple hours of this post i believenow i am not going to sit here and split hairs over what is considered a microtransaction or not or how long real money has affected things outside of the normal subscription fee i will simply state that i do not like to play games that openly embrace it like this game is heading first plex was introduced um ok  secondly was after a good while was the ability to move them thus opening the door for them to be destroyed and it being free money for ccp ugg this is not going in a good direction  thirdly is ccp saying they want microtransactions for cosmetic only and the first thing is not cosmetic at all ok well thats the final nail in the coffin for me  fourthly if their definition of cosmetic only microtransaction is not cosmetic only what will the definition of noncosmetic only be when they stay on this path introducing unique ships now available starting for 1999time to show off your stuff with uber ships like the grievous tempest  instead of 5 bonuses it has 10show your enemies that you are better than them and a there is no such thing is all players were created equali like playing games where everyone is measured on determination and skill everyone pvps against everyones bank account all day long in real life i dont want to come home and play a game where i have to do it there as welli spent a good long while sticking with the game hoping that specific issues would be addressed and kept holding onto the dream that ccp would fix them things like fleet fights currently calling people primary and secondary is the most efficient way to do combat 10 people or 1000 that is a very boring and unimaginative way to play there is no strategy in that i am not flaming people for fighting like that because currently it is the best way to fight other things like low sec and sov in 00 they simply are just blehsome of you say i wont find a better mmo out there so me leaving is a bad decision i dont have fun playing the game anymore just because there is no real competition for eve right now in serious spaceship business does not mean i have to keep throwing money at ccp i am perfectly content with leaving it in my bankas it stands the ccp bean counters only gauge how well they are doing issubscription paid  yes i like your gamesubscription not paid  no i dont like your gameflame if you want i voted no on all my accounts i will vote yes again when the game is appealing again ccp i truly hope it happens some time soon before i lose 100 interest in this game i will check back on the forums every few months or so and monitor how things are from the players point of view not from what ccp says in hyped up expansions that fail to deliver on almost all fronts
no
no
cosmetic onlyi do see the remap for plex as cosmetic btw

no noccp i hope u will not do it because i know a lot of online games where something like this destroy the game feeling in eve are a lot of people like students or people who are out of work who can be proud of their reached things but if then an 15 years old kiddi who plays maybe for 6 months and blow an 2 year old char out of space just because he has rich parents then i will leave eve and i think im not the only oneif ccp need money maybe things like coulored ships or named station would be better because such little things would a lot of people use and it would save fairnessat last sry for my grammar

yesi am a noob to eve i come from another mmo that used micropayments that massivly improved your gamei stoped playing said game because they got greedy got money obsessed things started costing alotso im all for paying to enhance my game and make it more enjoyable as long as they dont get greedy10 implants for real money only not buyable with isk im all for

noebenezer scrooge new ccp ceo
cosmetic only
noisk for dollars ripped the heart out the game already free skills for dollars via microtransaction neutral remapping will be the end of it as far as im concerned
vote yeswot im willing to pay for  quicker  training  remaps
nonot even cosmetic stuff except what we already havefrom the recent interview its clear that ccp has no idea what cosmetic only meanswhats more i worry now that incarna is going to have a heavy microtransaction model and that would be a terrible waste of many years of work  and my subscription money im actually willing to give ccp the benefit of the doubt that incarna will be something special  but if i have to pay to be part of it it will be meaningless to meany extra features in the game should be balanced and based on isk character skills player skills and time
noplex is a necessary evil this is not necessary and its still a bad bad thingthe microtransactions they plan better not be a plan to screw up what hope there is for incarna by giving us a free expansion with their hands out for our cash
no
no the game has been setup in a way that players have to make them selves better not use plex to make an instacharacter leave the game as it is
no leave the game alone
nonono trade plex for skills will undermine everything that other players have worked so damn hard for
no
yesi cannot in good conscience vote no when im already playing a game that makes buying isk and characters a legal option through plexthe floodgate was opened long ago
no
no  only over my dead bodyuhm isnt it already a dead body im using as capsule pilot
noalthough in principle i have no problem with people paying for cosmetic changes i know that the development of these items will take place at the expense of the games features
nojust to make it clearnofor those at ccp that need an imageplease visit your user settings to reenable images
heck no
noi though that was what dust was for anyhow
no
noif ccp hadnt repeatedly shown itself to be openly antagonistic to the wishes of its subscribers i would vote cosmetic only but ccp doesnt have the sense or integrity to stop there
no
noespecially no for skillpoints
no
cosmetic only
cosmetic only
cosmetic only
yeswhy not we already have an optional micro transaction system in game its called plex i could pay 2995 for 2 plex which i can sell for 700800m ish that i could then use to buy a carrier off the market which essentially means i paid 2995 for a carrier not to mention that i could do the same and buy a character off the character bazaar which is the same as buying skill points or remappingnobody seems to have a problem with any of that but put a label on it like micro transaction and everyone is up in arms
no no no and agian nodoing so would make this game to much like world of warcraft if we wantyed soemthing that could easily be fulfilled in 2 months time we would go to wow or startrek online the people that actualy liek this game and liek to spend tiem playing this game love the complexity and installing microtransactions will deplete the complexity aboundantlymicrotransactions is just a bad idea
agreed they need to focus more on the csms hot list and less on new features
more pages
the bubble effect for gates jump bridges even wormholes is fine but when a cap jumps and the sky is being torn open and people see all those cones from the caps dropping on the field you knew something nasty is coming now when people see a bunch of caps falling on the field with some small cheap bubble effect its not quite as impressive if the developers dont like the old effect make something similar to the old effect but much more detailed and epic if they even wanna add the lightening effect with the bubble i wont mind just bring back the lightening flashesedited to add support
a second middle slot on retribution would be nice i support
if the developers of eve are listening i would like to say i regret picking gallente i may even quit playing eve because i wasted so much time training my toon in gallente skills perhaps one day everyone will realize as i have as the years go by that they dont really care about are requests and only about new features that will attract new customers old customer requests arent worth investing time into as they are already paying customers if only the blasters and rails were fixed a small change like that would make a lot of customers happy including myselffly safe not sorry
but how much tank do you have on the mega theni think it have a very poor tank
supported the first time i saw a carrier i had read about how big they were supposed to be and then i saw one and i was like thats itcarriers and dreads imo could be a bit largerleave the hyperion and rokhs sizes alone though please
if supporting 20 take a lot of dev time then get rid of italthough maybe its possible to keep supporting interior station graphics for it would allow me to keep using this ty laptop to change skills when im not at home and since most graphics are in actual space it shouldnt take much im not too bothered about it though
shader model 30 has been supported since the geforce 6 series which was released in 2004intel gma x3000 has been on the market for laptop gfx since 2006its almost 2011your point is invalid
like stated in the dev blogthe whybecause they plan on putting in new graphic features and all those features would have to be developed twice once for shader 3 once for shader 2 and all that for all the future graphics incarna pops to mindi hated the last graphics update of eve because since they removed classic client i cant play on my netbook any morethis whole thing is actualy the best feature of eve if you bought any new game right now you would expect requirements far greater than eves the drawvack is that as eve develops you have to updateso to anyone whiningget a new pc or stop playing pc games thats the rule for all games including eve
they have said why they are doing it so of course because you dont like it you have to complain the man up comment is apt i would say die in a fire in game of course but your computer would fail to render that properlyin all seriousness a laptop costing  1000aud and therefore 1000 usd would run eve fine when they make this changestart putting 20 bucks a week and youll have enough saved by the time it comes out
i propose that ccp chisel graphics onto stone tablets and mail them to my house because i just dont want to upgrade to the fancy new technology you guys use
i demand to play eve via smoke signals
the lag in jita would be craaaazyyyy
eve has an account hacking problem because of all the 3rd party work that goes into the game extra security on accounts seems very appropriate in this case
yes implement it yes make it optionalif you make it i will buy itthe ones mailed out by blizzard for world of warcraft have the blizzard logo on them so they cant be mistaken for anything else unless one is blind of course if one is blind then that raises more fundamental usability issues with the game itself it should be a simple matter to have eve online rsa devices be manufactured with the ccp logo
supportedi would love to have a complimentary and functional eveonline key chain
supported former wow player and i like this system very few drawbacks to implementing this and the added optional security is wonderful
no way jose
no no no
was zee fff nein
if this happens then the next step is state issue ships for cash or other stuff so i say ccp is getting greedy no to plex remap and no to shops in eve
wellplex for a remap isnt a bad thingits not like they get a massive advantage rich people irl and in games would have great advantage u can buy plexs off the market which will drive the price up more but who cares it will readjust as with all item changespros  there wont be a new ccp mechanic that allows some players to benefit more ingame than others people with more money can buy and sell plex ingame and get an advantage already  ccp has more plex to sell  people can buy characters with isk  this feature could possibly help fixing skill messups and lazynesscons  real money trading happens regardlessthis is the real pros vs cons
supported
i propose we incorporate the same restrictions for creating new topics and replying to topic as in caodie no npc corps excluding militiascorp sizes and posting with your mainsthis will stop a wide variety of dumb threads that get started well not really but it will cut out a lot of trash topics from being posted
no it wont
not supportedunfortunatly a lot of things need to be posted for the good of the comunity if you had to post with your main there could be a lot of back lash from the corpalliance you are in also from bluesi do a lot of balancing post for the best of the game a lot of people who exploit unbalanced stuff would hurt the corp i am in and my friends so it would cause people to keep quite instead of speaking the truth when everything was all about nano people were afraid to speak out against it there was even an alliance that exploited it day in and day out because they could not get the numbers to face their enemy face to face in an even match so they exploited nonstop the community was able to finally get ccp to fix the problem that alliance virtually self imploded on the spot because they forgot how to pvp with everything elsethis would be a dangerous path and a no win situation for all with npc alts people can post about bugs and unbalanced stuff and not worry about getting the sharp end of a stick from those who exploit such thingsif you dont like the forums no one is forcing you to read them gobacktoworldofwarcraft
well it wont stop all of them but more annoying ones
i fixed it for youps supported
but then id have to go spend a million isk and form my own corpbah supported
i lold
i think just restricting it to posting with the oldesthighest sped toon on the account would be a win for the boards general sanity
i made a proposal that was exactly that when posting it uses the character on the account with the highest skill points only this was meet with much hatred and flaming and it sank to the bottom of assembly hall only the trolls would hate such a change on the forums to be honest i think i posted it with marlona sky but cant seem to dig it up if you find it and it is not more than 90 days old feel free to give it a thumbs up or make a new onethe forum landscape would become infinity better if that change went thru
as son as you can come up with a definition of main that we can all agree on ill support thisno im serious i would love to have some rules applied to posting in ah but how does one define your main character
remember when ccp reimbursed us with skill points they assigned the skill points to the character on each acct that had the highest sp total if there was a way to apply that to the forums or as a secondary measure most time in gamebut really what the point of this is to clean up ah alt post and unnecessary topics from alts and killing the supports from alts 1 account  3 chars  3 supports
this post pretty much sold me on this idea supported
dear god yes
i think the real problem is that this forum isnt really suited to the current garbage forum softwarethe purpose of the forum is to vet and discuss ideas for game improvements like fi forum with voting the problems with the current implementation includelots of duplicateoverlapping postsno way to sort by most popular or supported threadsideasno way to vote downif the forum were structured more like an ideascalereddit forum instead of the steaming pile of outdated garbage that it currently is itd be less of an issue when people post nonsense their ideas get downvoted and hidden
no and no why should we be forced to out our mains in order to submit a proposal because there are crappy ones or troll bait that people keep replying to because some pathetic people keep trying to get attention by screaming look at me with poorly crafted rantproposalsthe forums are allegedly going to get reworked and probably there will be tools to ignorehide charactersthreads you dont want to seem assuming the new forums dont become a police state worship ccp or get banned the problem solves it self
if you had bothered to read my second post alt posting allows for more supports than actually exists 1 account can create 3 supports for one thread which totally skews the number of people actually supporting the topicalso if a troll cant hide behind an alt in the assembly hall it will not try to troll or make troll bait topics in a sense it would clean up this forum of a lot of dumb topics created by altsps post with your main

you know what screw you guys i take precious time out of my schedule to help with this game and all i get is flamed and trolled and for what i dont get paid to do this i volunteer my time to help you and you spit in my face ccp leaves this thread open and locks all of mine it is obvious they pick and choose when to follow forum rules and when to turn a blind eye the only conclusion is that the op is an alt of a ccp employee so its either shadow or applebabe hippocrits going to reroll a new alt and use lame ass normal type so you unapreaciative s actually read my post for what they are worth and not focus on a single ship loss from ages agopeace ers

the cookie cutter hml fit pimpboat with 4 faction bcs and 6 launcher subsystem approach 900 long range dps after a set of missile implants that number is not just for hams its the reason carebears use tengus they see that particular fit in battleclinic notice the eft numbers and drool once you drop the dps to 600 its lower than the harder to gank bs that the tengu is supposed to replace while still easily ganked by 2 gankers while the bs takes half a dozen whats the point
r u saying that ure also one of those carebears that double as eft warriors too funny how u tried to leave that part out despite how ure also drooling over just the dps instead of just whining so much just go ahead and switch to a battleship so u can a move like a turtle b turn like a turtle c take full torpedo and cruise missile damage and best of all d switch to weaker long range ammo til the dps is something u can really cry about at least itll finally give u the peace of mind u so desperately need but then again since ure so dead set on whining some more about risks for rewards go ahead and make another one of those clueless noob posts that ure also whining about
still paper tankexplosion radius of cruise missiles
its just a bad idea in my opinion the sec status change is already rough like it is right now i would love to see you grind rats in 00 for a month to get from 10 to 199 its a very boring task since insurances nerfs not every suicide ganking is profitable also a hulk well fitted can tank a suicide ganker ok if hes solo or whatever if its about losing freighter their freighters containers to hide your cargo and stuffs there is ways to avoid suicide ganking
please do id like a good laugh if hes stupid enough to not learn
supported a round of smart bombs easily strips the myrmidonishtar of any effective dps furthermore jump into lowsec and count the drone boats camping the gate drones are a favorite target of gate guns theres a reason you never see myrmidon gangs roaming lownull sec
yes should have been implemented a long time ago as well as reconnection to drones
supported with an alternate tradeoff suggestioninstead of a flat 30 seconds or two minutes instead make it 1 second per cubic meter of drone so to load a single light drone from the cargohold into the drone bay without orca support requires no drone activity for 5 seconds but to load 2 heavy drones 2 medium drones and 1 light drone into a drone bay without orca support requires 75 secondsvessels that offer fitting services to other ships like the orca should be exempt from this timer when transferring drones from their own cargohold into their own drone bay
not supported losing drones should hurt
23 minutes should be the timer or so imagine alliance tournaments drone boats could destroy all if cargo could be used if it didnt take long
maybe id be concerned about a drone player feeding drones in piecemeal as the other player kills them tbh a flat time of 12 minutes sounds bestany other reasoning i think losing drones over the period of a roam should only hurt you financially and in the immediate short term while you are fighting much like ammo costs or overheatingrepairlosing drones shouldnt cripple ships like a myrmidon if a player wants to invest extra isk into giving their ship more endurance its the same principle as nearly burning out your guns but choosing to have nanite paste along so you can do the same thing all over againthis
some people come and go when it comes to games some play for 5 years with three accounts then finally realize they are not good at the game and rage quit all their assets are then lost to oblivion to collect dusti propose that after a certain time period when it is obvious they are not coming back to the game the assets are put in a system and are part of mission rewards drops from rats part of rewards for exploration and the new incursion expansionthere is no reason why all that gear including ships they rage quit logged in space should be unused
i propose that we ignore this stupid proposal and support this thread instead
lol the hattersa simple and constructive post would suffice alas from your entire posting history i see you are incapable of doing that
well it is a stupid proposal and you are an obvious troll so there really isnt any point in discussing this seriously
please learn to spell correctlyalso this is a terrible idea here is why people stop playing the game for many reasons it could be rl issues no money military new job etc people also leave because they want a break there is no reason to take away all of their stuff just because they stopped playing

this is pretty stupid id also like to point out that the chairwoman of the current csm is a notorious outlaw in game so if we followed your poorly thought out analogy youd be giving the mafia control of the marines
it realy dosnt mater if it have sliders or not
i dont see a need for sliders youre likely just asking them since the usability of the system currently on sisi is very lacking and it isnt clear how things operate there i will give ccp the benefit of the doubt here and let them finish the system and tweak it to be more intuitive if it is still a failure after all that then i can support sliders as a replacement
since all his threads are either utterly idiotic with no idea how they would affect game balance or clear trolls with no purpose other than to allow him to post in lower case and insult people who point out how dumb he isdiscussps  if you lock this thread ccp then i sugest you lock the 100 personal attack thread they made about me here
drake isnt an idiot he is just a bit of an asshat to other people tbh im surprised the other thread hasnt been locked yet since it is against the rules and not constructive on the other hand if ccp starts to enforce their rules here your posts will also likely result in a short forum vacation
why thank you for making my case even stronger than ever cromoand linking the very thread to prove it all the reason why you should be silencedi mean there are over 91 people who think your out of your damn mind cromo explain thatpeople who dont exactly like me very much either to top that off go figure
hey arent you that guy who lost a dramiel to a badger then biomassed out of humiliationhey arent you that guy who got in deep doodoo for claiming he made someone quit the game and posting logs of it that proved hed left out of boredomhey arent you that guy who posts in allbold capshey arent you that guy we would all punch in the face ingame for being so annoyinghey arent you that guy who posted a counterban thread because you have no comebackshey arent you that guy who uses shift to make all his capital letters instead of using capslockhey this text is orange
someone hit a nerve
its ironic that literally the only funny thing about you was losing that dramiel to a badger and then biomassingyou are such an unimpressive troll
by the way thanks for the linky can always use a few more sigs on my proposal also if they were going to lock it dont you think they would have done already i mean theyve had 6 whole weeks guess they agree with me 
im on a horse
fixed your post dear and i agree hes always been perfectly nice to me
go away

in this hypothetical 3rd world country would the script involve some sort of linear progression that made sense at some point would it take less than a few days for these 3rd world guys to read that script could we retrain the isk farmers to do it theyre in game anyway
ccp would like to get rid of extra plexes its pretty clear its still specialhowever this doesnt belong in this section
and why was incarna something they needed to be up in arms about in the first place after all vocal forum whiners  the player base not accusing you of being that just making a point my guess emphasis mine before someone accuses me of doing the same thing i just criticised would be that the vast majority of players are either indifferent or would welcome it as something new to try me personally im cautiously optimistic but if it doesnt work out its not the end of the world after all i already enjoy playing the game as it is nowi can understand the concern about the amount of devs working on incarna but i think it deserves the amount of effort theyve been putting into it simply because of the implications for ccp as a whole not just for eve if as ccp have been saying the technology will also be used in dust and the wod mmo as well as for eve it makes sense to take the time and resources to do it right and those have to come from somewhere all the csm can do is represent the views of the players of eve which i think theyve been doing a damn good job of so faranyway im starting to ramble so enough of me for now
as teh insurance exchange rate or insurance fraud has amply demonstrated the isk loss for losing a ship is a very arbitrary value if i kill a pirate in a ship with only basic insurance i will get more than killing a pirate in a platinum insured shipbounty is paid on pod kills not ship kills so if i the pirate lose a ship to someone can i get podkilled by a friendalt to recover some of my losseswhat is the value of modules market price mineral contents i suppose that the value of ships will be the mineral content used by ccpif we use mineral content meta14 and maybe even 6 modules will be worth less than meta 0 modules
just wanted to reach out to the other eve players and see what they think honest opinions wanted hilarious flaming always welcomei see alot of people wanting cloaking to be scannable and eccm to be usefull keeping in mind that i do love my falcon and this would hurt my jamming very muchmy proposal is to tie the two together use eccm to to be able to probe out noncovops cloaked ships the basic idea is that if your ships sensor strength is higher than the cloaked ships sensor strength that it is capable of being probed down using regular combat probes and as an added bonus once you get 100 scan it decloaks the ship for local grid decloaking i dont know how to apply this to covops cloaked yet and any ideas would helplet the flaming commenceari kelor
interesting idea nice to see people remembering the point of being able to fit a covert cloak in the first placenot sure about the 100 decloak idea though that may be a little too much

cosmetic onlyi am fine with the current plex system in which people basically pay for someone elses subscription in exchange for isk in this case the transaction is doubleedge  on one side some person gets ingame currency for no work at all but on the other side someone gets gametime this sort of microtransaction if you can call buying plex a microtransaction is cool because it involves the community of the game like this and create new and interesting ingame markets even when people use loads of isk to buy characters they are at least buying those characters from other players players who took months or years to skill those characters up out of game transactions that are essentially between players as it is now with plex and characters is a cool thing to me and it does not harm the game with current stuff there is still a fair playing field for everyone and all plexcharacter transactions involve playertoplayer exchangesa cash shop removes the playertoplayer exchange aspect of the current plex and character trade and makes players go straight to ccp to buy things for their characters this isnt necessarily a bad thing but i think the unique playertoplayer exchange aspect of the current system should be appreciated much more than it is for its uniqueness and for its success a cash shop of some kind could be implemented alongside this but only if its in a way that does not intrude on the current plexcharacter sale stuff and that means no buying characters and by extension skill points or isk and by extension things that can be bought with isk for cash if its cosmetic stuff only though and if the stuff in the cash shop is also purchasable with plex bought with isk by players who dont spend more than their normal subscription fee then that is fine with me
no
noi can tolerate cosmetic only because then i can laugh at the tools paying ccp extra money for a silly hat while walking around stationsbut im going ahead and signing on for the quitting eve if they go through with this club
noooooooooo
cosmetic onlyi want that pink rupture
microtransactionslol you mean like buying a plex with money then selling it for isk then buying what you wanted in gamei can tolerate that cause i already am but as soon as they introduce something an item that requires you to pay with real money then  it i quit
no

noone of the biggest deal breakers to me

hrm isnt microtransactions already in the game with plexpersonally as long as they make the exchange currency either isk or plex as in you use a plex to do the remap then im fine because that can be traded to players not actually paying real money and just happened to have the isk aroundotherwise for items and benefits that you can only have from direct payments to ccp directly without the ability to trade for iskthen no

too bad ccp dosnt read these threads i bet the mods skim over it and just go meh
agreed good arguements
give them all another midslot another rig slot 30 more cpu and 5 more power and theyd be pretty darn versatilethe electronic attack ships also need a similar boost not another mid slot but patching their racial resitance holes and maybe giving them some bomb resitance so theyre not dead with one bomb unless they fit a shield extenderand the notion of an armor tanked frigate is sort of odd to me 
fitting requirements and tracking imo damage scales better when you can fit neutrons the only problem is that you usually end up severely gimping your fit in some wayyou can put heavy pulse iis on a harbinger and still have a 800 plate with room for an mwd if you choose with a brutix or myrm you cant do this at all and fitting the best autocannon is hardly ever an issue on a hurricane or similar ship things would be a little better if you didnt have to sacrifice an arm and a leg to put heavy neutron iis on a blaster bonused ship in fact this is the only time when i use medium blasters and that is only on a shieldgank myrmidon shield gank brutixes are garbage fitting nightmare less ehp gimp it with ancillaries to put neutrons etcthe rest of the time you will do better by fitting 425s instead of ions and 220s for electrons or flying a better ship ditto railguns

super carriers obviously needs to be biggerit cant dock it costs 1520x more then a cap they are called super carriers take a lot more components to build  do i really need to go on why they obviously need to be biggerwhy this isnt fixed many years ago is beyond me
supported though i would hope for a good implementation to support the number of multiple account owners on eve
wholeheartedly supported tho iirc ccp already went meh over it in the past

thats quite the fit youve got there
i support this idea i have not been around long enough to see what they looked like thanks for the pics but would like to see them retured into the game
from what i hear they were removed because they were causing excessive lag on the server not sure though
i hear your voice in the dark sandrine if i look those pics i rememberit was very nice optical visionsign on for bringing back them

qft againplus learning skills kept 2 of my friends from starting to play eve entirelydropping learning skills will make me less lonely online yo
i do not like the idea very much
i have to say its pretty sad that olafsson doesnt have the integrity to answer to this thread and state the same thing herenot become a dinosaur my ass i hope everyone is aware that this means development time is being invested into features that will only be available for additional payment development time was spent on the remap for plex with incursion and the trend will continue and get worse in the future its not about exactly what they do its the fact that they spend valuable resources on it that are not being used in order to improve game performance for everyonethey invested dev time we ultimately paid for for the sole purpose of getting more money from us than they are already getting anyway despite the fact the majority of players evidently doesnt want that its a pretty ingenious concept if you think about itthe same devs and coders who were working on remap for plex could have worked on fixing bugs weve had to deal with for years rebalancing some game aspects finally getting the address book in working order again or properly coding the patch that broke the entire ui and that took them 3 optional patches to defuse with some people still crashing at random the client suddenly becoming a gpu hogging fps massacre for just as many and mail system and autolink features just about brokeneve really has one of the most dedicated playerbases ive seen anywhere  and ccp is now using that credit to try and milk the cow for all its worth instead of giving us the quality product they could deliver because we fracking well made it possible by investing our faith and money in them over yearsso ccp executives wont become dinosaurs  but they will break explicit promises make a grab for your money and introduce items for  that give the buyer no real advantage just a small one 2 dps maybe and all of that against the wishes of most of their customers
no
plex should just stay the way they are  timecodes nothing else they should be used for  ccp stop here thats not the way we want it there were several points already where you made me thought about leaving the game but this will just break it no way this is gone happen sorry but no not with me there are also other games that we can move on and go to and play elsewhere  btw for your calculations i got more than 1 account running so well think about it twice and calculate this in 
in my opinion selling gtcplex for isk is more gamebreaking than thisi dont see the problem
no to microtransactions mostly cause they dont begin or stay at the micro level and 35month should be enough for two accounts
no to microtransactions
supporting as promised you want to troll theres a dozen other forums to do so in leave the assembly hall alone
no ive seen plenty of good proposals from npc corp alts and plenty of trash from corpalliance memberswhat ah needs is better forum tools for voting filtering and organizing proposals like proposed in this thread with 100 approval
you can vote only once in a thread for each account and no muting players that dont suit your idea of what is a worthy player especially in the forum meant to gather players suggestion and votes on those suggestions is a very bad idea
supported
funny here i am posting in my own thread on my jita alt supporting my own topicpost with your main
venkul mul is his main afaikme on the other hand am an alt on my 2nd accountand im with venkul on this one these forums ah and fi need better tools to manage this stuff instead of caod rules and if the csm would have worked with the guys putting together a proposalidea tracking database you wouldnt feel the need to post this proposal herenot supported
that was your third post not your secondthe solution to that would then be to simply make it so your account got supportdenounce rights not the characters instead of one account being able to support or denounce a proposal on every character you can only do it once when you try to supportdenounce a proposal it checks to see if your account has done so already if so you cant do it again on the same topic youd still get people commenting supportdenounce but if we actually get a real updown system you could ignore all the people who dont know how to cast a votei prefer to do my forum rolling on an alt if something is important i use my main but only if i think it merits the mainliness that allegedly brings in my mind my paranoid concern is also the trolls who use the forums to sniff out people to bother for disagreeing with them or fun just because you make everyone use their main account however you determine that most hours loggedtime spent in spacejumps per month doesnt mean people will magically stop trolling or posting sillynonsense proposals
horrible idea when it comes to those faction ships being illegal infact the whole blackmarket idea sucks but other then that i support
people get famous by making a ton of isk then worry people might catch up so spew bs arguments in hopes they get their way luckily ccp is smart enough to ignore things like this plus i always cheer for the underdog this wont help any underdog catch up nearly as much as the people on top fear it will even full on implementation of microtransactions wouldnt seeing as the plex market pretty much allows me to do whatever i want right away anyway but im all for making them shift uncomfortably in their seats watching it be implemented wishing they had shut their mouths in the first place when the world doesnt collapse
victoryhehe couldnt help it i now declare that instead of the word  people use the word chromo effecteverybody knows you never go full chromo effect
and you will see that your ideas are still stupid and a waste of time reading
looking at a few ideas you posted this game is better place if you stop volunteering your time you dont have to waste your time you dont get instulted and these forums are not filled with bad ideas go do everyone an favor
whats the alternative he wouldnt be able to sell the char in the bazar that name would forever be a no go
i dunno id give him an isk for it  just for the ability to toss it out at parties and have a good laugh

lol that sounds fun think i might start doing that
im offended nobody ever made an attack thread like this for me
he deserved it you dont simple as really you really have to work on the posting to be as bad as cromo was
yep faction missions seem to be a huge cruel joke i stockpiled a few hundred thousand lp in the regular lp store only to find nothing worth buying so i figured i would try to get into faction missions for the second time to get that nice imperial navy dominixtoday i flew around to 8 different gallente faction agents to try to get even a tiny amount of lp for my factions store so far every single level 1 and level 2 agent i spoke with only offered me missions between 17 and 24 hops away and every single one was into 02 spacethat is completely absurd for level 1 and level 2 missions to be completely suicidal looks like ill just let somebody else do the work and buy my faction stuff off contracts paying half a billion isk for a faction navy ship doesnt seem like nearly as much of a bad deal now
and ure wrong cause isk farming to put minerals or mods on the market or at the very least fund yourself to pvp is still supporting pvp only how the isk is used determines whether it supports pvp or not not how its farmed
honestly id like to see some missions where sometimes but not all the time the player will fail to complete them even with proper skills tactics and eve missions open in the browserand for those missions id like to see a smallerthanusual standing gain and loss so that people will not be afraid to play them and sometimes fail
im sure ive seen the topic raised before though i cant recall whether it was here or in features and ideas otherwise known as where threads go to diesince eve is a strange and magical place where we cant use the internet to bid on items unless were in the same area code as they arecouldnt we have a function to set destination for the nearest system that is in a specified regionsuch as wanting to bid on a contract in the forge instead of setting destination for jita only to discover that another forge system was about 20 jumps closer
pleeeeeease o
yep wanting that for years
yes pleasewhile were at it make regions autolinkable for maximum accessibility
great idea ive also wanted this for forever signed
been kinda wanting the same thing for a while too
ought to be easy enough  if you treat a region as a single system with rather a lot of gates you can even use the same routefinding algorithm
concord is responding to ganks like a policeman who sees a child shot bleeding out on the ground and instead of stopping to help just keeps shooting at the bad guyspolicemen in real life dont do that they may try to do both but saving the child instantly becomes their first prioritymy point is guys concord could and should repair the shield armor and hull damage of a gankee with everything in their power by all means go after the bad guys tooright now the child bleeds to death almost every time
concord arent policemen why do you insist that they act like them
a module that if fitted and activated gives you a couple seconds of 999 resistancesthis could potentially be used as antisuicide module but it could also be used as anticoncord it even could be used to sway the battle back in your favour
it should be called the paladin system
one question whyif you find yourself the target of suicide gankings then it is because you are doing something wrong to begin with flying stuff thats more expensive that the ship easy pickings etc dont try to addchange game mechanics simply because you dont understandwant to expend the efforthave the inconvenience of playing the odds of survivability in your favoralso your proposed module has far reaching consequences throughout pvp it would essentially become the next damage control unit because who in their right mind wouldnt want to have a few seconds of invulnerability
sounds like a great idea
not supported this completely destroys the point of different sized drone bays the myrmidonishtar may lose drones but they can replace them something like a vagabond cant fit any spares thats the point drones are a different weapon system with different mechanics
for the sake of gameplay and logic i would be ok with it if it would be tied to a module preferably a high slot one that would have to be activatedand would maybe even make the ship unmaneuverable because how would that even work you got 2 different spaces in your ship the drone bay which maybe has some sort of drone launch apparatus and the normal cargo hold which is space compressed and is not in any way connected with the drone bay
it doesnt completely destroy the point of different sized drone bays what i have described can be already done in lowsec where you can carry an extra flight of 221 or a flight of ogres and after the fight is over you dock up and replace the drones dronebay there hasnt been made pointless by smart myrm players carrying an extra flight when they arent repfit in the immediate combat situation dronebay still dictates your dps if you lose your 221 you will have to switch to 5 hammerhead iis and so on ditto with the vaga losing its warriorsthe only thing it will really change is fights in 00 where you might see more myrmidons roaming if they can replace their primary weapon system after a fightyes they are a weapon system that can get easily destroyed or left behind obviously doesnt need a method to replace its losses am i right i mean turrets and missiles are able to overheat for extra benefit yet also repair themselves in the field drone platforms should have a similar method of selfreplenishment

yes hatmakers are indeed very funnyalso what the heck would be that time period some peopel can take multiyear breaks its never obvious this proposal is just greed
how about we just remove all assets from anybody who posts like cromo effect and distribute them to random noobs in 10 systems
or we enforce mandatory biomassing of people who accumulate so much forum rage that even when theyre serious we mock them
mmm forum rage tastes like candied sunshine sprinkled with angel dust
its so tasty must have moar
rest assured cromo  were laughing at you not with you
also there are other countries than us in world you could just have researched other opportunities than us military for inspiration now it just seems like blatant viral marketing for us

there needs to be some numerical code for each feature so it would be practical to exactly recreate what you had been working on with a trial character  or even better a third party programhow a character will look is sort of a big deal if youre going to look at it for months or yearsit might even be something youd want help with by someone good at it
lets phrase it like this if the sculpting feature stays crap like right now which knowing ccps quality track record is not far fetched ill have to say that sliders are a must otherwise youll have a hard time creating faces that look remotely sound
not only seems like a pretty crap idea but would probably require some serious coding which would probably totally destroy all gameplay for like a month if experience with patches holds trueif youre just dying to screw with cloaking which it doesnt need and make eccm worthwhile which it probably does need i would just do the following1 put a time limit on cloaks dependent on type and increased by cloaking skill so a prototype would give you a few minutes before having to be reactivatedimproved maybe 30 min to an hour and covops cloak permarun change covops cloak to requiring lvl 5 cloaking 2 signal strength which is increased by eccm gives an extra 100m or so per point on top of the 2000m decloak range
for all the douche nozzels who constantly  on the forums and play armchair politicscorporate managereconomics advisor the only power the csm has is what ccp gives it the only other possible source of power for them would be if players were willing to unsub when they deemed it necessary to apply pressure to ccp if youre not willing to do that then maybe you should just stfu and color call your mom or something if you need to blow off steam with no actual commitment to do anything
u mad bro
is is possible that we can add the issue concerning destroy hull survivability
still nothing on this ehmy main was considering this path seeing the swift action by ccp higherups ill stick to a bs and continue to pull the trigger with the precision of an untrained monkeybut not caldari they suck  that is another discussion

cosmetic onlyi consider plex for remap not giving special advantages as if someone want to he can make a 1 year plan and so dont need a remapas the remap is a bonus and not needed i consider that it dont affect the gameplayi would be for a plex use for current microstransactions like swaping portraiti would be against something really obvious like free spsbut i dont really care as microstransaction cant give you knowledge on how to avoid doing it wrong and i consider that knowledge is the most important on eveyour money can buy a titan but wont help you playing well with it

i have about a year or more trained into hybrid turrets and supports for caldari hyrbid ships i dont wanna hear it gallente are lightyears ahead in terms of viable hybrid turret users just suck it up and wait for ccp to do something like the rest of us if youre not willing to submit an original thought other than tearsps cross training into angel ships is easy if fotm makes you feel better
for great justice also for whoever said it would look horrible maybe you should look at the latest incarna screens the facial structures look anything but toonish if not nudity at least the opportunity to play around with the gender indicators of your character
ccp add everything in this post incarna and fix the fleet lag 2 of those your already doing and ill call this game a win people will be more willing to have the patience required to play this game if it wows you with amazing visuals
i support thisthere is a very large difference between making missiles overpowered and making them acceptable for all sorts of situations like guns are im fine if caldari remain the kinetic race but heres what i want to be donestandard missiles should not have 8 second rof thats stupid on a frigate its justified on artillery which has good alpha so i hear but missiles do not have good alpha and if the target has anything other than optimally huge sig radius and zero velocity your damage rather craps outhell if all the missile launchers got less horrible rof maybe caldari wouldnt be viewed so much as pve onlyif nothing else why not buff caldari boats drone bays apparently they were once part of the gallente federation so why not just give them some larger drone bays but dont have the bonuses it might justify the gurista ships being blends of caldari and gallente weapons technology as well
can i haz engine trailzi dought the lag story heavily its just an extended version of the same effect we have now i would accept them just as warpmwd trails and not as normalab trails just having them back would be nice
i fully support your proposal
i liked them and miss them too
this thread has to be a joke or something ccp said to eurogamer a while ago that theyre coming back in incursion
i dont support this proposal remap for plex is a cool feature 
no it isnt but ill get you started in the right directionpros ccp makes more moneypeople who want to use plex or spend  for more remaps canpeople who hope for more uses for plex character portrait swap name changes etc gain hope for the futureplayers can skip over a mechanic that is only offered by ccp thus ccp has no competition for the service hello monopolypeople too stupid to understand how a remap works have an opportunity to reverse one that went badpeople who want to only train at maximum sphr gain that ability through the sales of plexconsthe exra money ccp makes goes to whatever ccp wants not necessarily eveccp sees they can make more pay for feature options to players and have the monopoly on themtoo few people make use of the remap option spurring more pay for features programstoo many people make use of the remap option and ccp sees this as motivation for even more features to sell playerseve goes down a road of pay for features that ruin the game
wtf ccp
no to plex for remap
no this is a very slippery slope by correctly setting up skill plans and remap points and a bit of cash or excess isk it wouldnt be that hard to maximize your sphour giving you an advantage over the person who cant afford the plex and has to wait the year out being able to switch your remap at will to minimize your training times does give an unfair advantagewith all that said if this does go in it needs a limit once every 6 months maybe but i would rather it not make it in at all
got to keep capsuleer alive its such a great app i always read the blogs and check my skills to see if i forgetten to add on to the queuewhich i have so its saved my skills a few times on that 1

supporting cuase cromo effect hates the idea
id honestly say if youre going to post something that you think might have negative repercussions for your main then you shouldnt bother posting itand if youre worried about trolls train internet skin to v or quit eve were all jerks and trolls here
anything you can do chromo effect can probably do better you can make a corporation with your main and 8 alts in it chromo will no doubt appear with an entire nullsec sovholding alliance of ship toastersi would prefer to see a simpler measure for the forums as a whole of one character per account being designated as the forum posting character the option of changing which is removed once that character has any posts published
nice to discover that ccp has broken some other thing last time i checked it it was not possible to vote with more than 1 character for each account me go to the bug reporting can i suggest to you to post with your brain and maybe check people before using that stupid memenot a good idea there are plenty of sections of the game where you will use an alt for valid reasons for example plexgmt sales price checking character sales and so on especially character sales as you will want to post with the sold character then there is the problem of deleted characters what will happen if you have posted once with your noob character in the new citizens qdyou will be looked forever to use that character even if you have deleted it after 1 day and restarted from scratch
fine for me to let people post with their main but who no npc corporations enough people are with their main in an npc corp why would you exclude militias then they got probably more alts than regular npc corporations 50 is spy alt of enemy militia of remaining ones 80 is alt of people who tried fw and gave up on the horrible mechanics
whatever would we do without chromo in ah
supportedsay it on your main or stfu
not everyone is in a large or even medium sized corporation for any number of reasons and might actually live with other playerscorporations who look for people to pester going unnoticed is how those players avoid problems from eves more special type of player being in that kind of situation means they are easy targets if picked on unlike those who might enjoy having plenty of corporation members to back them up if another corporation looked to bother them who might be out in 00 where they are surrounded by allies or the same enemies that were always there or even in whlowsec someone being a  who disagrees with that kind of player with alliesisolation and looking to mess with them has little effect on their gameplay assuming the person looking to pester people even disagreed with that type of player in the first place for the remaining people without numbersisolation disagreeing with that type of person who by their choices might feel strongly about htfu evepvp and other mantras about bashing someone down to hump them for the lulz well that player can affect their gameplay for voicing their concernsdisagreement i dont think people who disagree with those types of players should need to out their mains or form a corporation if they arent in a pc just to commentdiscuss ideas about screwing everyone who doesnt agree with a particular way to play the game or a change to force others to play the game a certain way some corporations might also not want their members to be getting into discussions about gameplaymechanics because that too can bring unwanted attention on the corporation and members many corporations expect a certain conduct from players such as no smack talk well with this idea expect to see no posting on the forums from some of them too i know plenty simply dont care because they welcome someone trying to mess with them and would be all too happy to have the people who disagree with them just shut up rather than deal with any blowback for telling them how wrongselfishetc they or their ideas are that boost their gameplay and nerf others that people do think that this is a good idea is pathetic all in the lame attempt to say it will cut down on trollinguseless topics trolling happens by a certain type of person who arguably has a certain kind of play style useless topics are posted by a larger group but probably more so by newer players who dont know enough about the gameahetc neither of which imo will get reduced by much with the proposed change tldr buy waffles tasty tasty waffles
i support this adea also i dont get your arguement that this will be an advantage for some if someone didnt start 2003 he already has a big disadvantage that cant be countered with this plex feature
support its a means whereby a new player can try catch up 35 for a couple extra remaps on top of the bonus newbie remap should be enough to get someone competitive in a year in small ships which is still too long in my opinion and 35 aint much now if only we can get rid of learning skills too plex for remap is possibly the only microtransaction possible that 1 will be of greater advantage to newer players than older and 2 wont radically change game mechanics or structure waiting a year and a half to be competitive in a battleship or hac is not fun ideally ccp would change the game structure to be more newbie friendly but that would lead to ragequits above and beyond this so this is probably the best possible optionstill against shiny ship microtransactions or direct sp microtransactions
weekly bump for attention

i play video games cause its like watching a movie you have control of and lots needs to be done to make this game look as awesome as it does in all of your deceiving trailers ccp your trailers are almost a lie people watch those then play the game and go wtf is this i shoot 100 missiles at a ship and each missile looks like it could have taken out the entire us state of texas
it would be easier than having 1 defender missile on all system i want to go to check and a system without station wouldnt be a problem anymore example  forge to domain  niarja no station here
wanted this a few times myself and im not even industrytrade
ill support if its a module that can only be fitted to an industrial using their bloated cpu and requires the same fuel as a pos does for its invulnerability timenot that a couple seconds will mean that much when youre looking at a ship that is slow as a dying slug in the first place
this would end almost all pvp in the game terrible idea
youve all just been trolledhes just as every bit as bad as cromo effectjust not so obvious
ever watched a promo video for eve online chances at included some awesome pvp battle or some such where in the new player experience does it help a person understand how to handle or work their way into pvpwhy would an mmo so revolving around pvp have no real gateway into one of their most advertised features what is the common entry way into pvp currently to bludgeon your head against experienced pvpers in lowsec or 00 and just learn the ropes through losing ship after ship how many empire dwellers stay in empire simply because the roof to enter into the lower security spaces feels too high and foreboding mainly due to inexperience and the paths to gain that experience are simply not fun for themwhy isnt there a better way something appealing and safe enough that both new players and veterans can test out things but confining enough that the vast majority of individuals would not forgo normal pvp for this new featurepresenting virtual battle academya few key details of vrba no loss from losing your ship or pod its essentially a game within a game kind of like that dream  in dallas nothing that happens here really matters no reward for winning a round you won a training simulator congratulations go win the real thing now champ no sp limitations each person upon entering is essentially placed into a max sp clone for the purposes of their skills in the ship they use for the arena pre set team compositions and fittings that players are randomly placed into upon joining the vrba queue every match would be either a mirror match or a scenario designed to teach a specific skill  end of round stats for your e  fanatics join the queue from any station anywhere in eve  zero aoe weaponry on the preset fits so friendly fire incidents revolve around a scaling punishment system detailed below  no trial accounts only a character actively training a skill may queue up for the matches if you are not training a skill upon entering the match your place in line is kindly given to the next participant until you start training something you lazy freaking bum oh tell me more matches would range between 1v1 honour duels to 10v10 or 20v20 at ccps discretion  team loadout would be semi randomly selected from a list of ccp generated fittings and ships  pvp experts would not only be welcome to join but encouraged see how many times you can use that trick you know to completely facestomp the empire dwellersnewbies before they learn to use it against you the more experienced the competition the more you learn  friendly aurora spokenthis is importantdialogs upon entering the match instruct you on the role and abilities of your specific ship these can be shut off just as any other tutorial for those who feel they know everything or simply wish to figure it out for themselvesfriendly fire punishment systemupon the first friendly kill you are ejected from the match shown an aurora video on how to properly read and deal with what your overview is showing you and gifted with a one hour break from the vrba system the second friendly kill you are again ejected from the match shown an aurora video and gifted with a five hour break4th kill 24 hours5th kill 48 hoursat some point again at ccps discretion you would lose the ability to join these matches outright permanently team setups could be pulled from previous alliance tournament teams out of thin freaking air or even from historical battles in eves history this would even open up the possibility of shiny matches involving faction ships simply to increase fun factor and woo the new players into wanting to strive for these ships they wouldnt normally get to fly into combat withfew fun facts to reiterateplayers in this cannot use their sp pick their ship pick their loadout get  from it at all of any sort
so what your saying isarmageddon i choose youpokemon music startsnot supporting seriously ccp has frakked up their game so baddly and yet you want to make it worse by adding new stuffhow about we fix the crap we already got first eh
no
not at all the player would have zero control over what ship they fly or how its fit they would get slotted into an arranged team randomly they could be in a rifter or a t3 ship
are you sure you didnt mean to write a list of proposed fw changesnot to declare new edens newest bloodsport over before it starts but arranged evenly matched fights only happen in jita and even then youll usually get jumped by the opponents corp by the end of it and arenastyle fights dont really teach anyone anything about pvp in evethat said i would do nothing but queue up for these matches all day sounds like theyd be a blast
ya well putting a person randomly into a 600 man fight where one side horribly outnumbers the other doesnt sound fun or constructive so mimicking a tournament setting would be the only real way to go about it
so what you want is sisi only more hurrrrr zany and random wheeeee
ya pretty much asking a new player to set up sisi can be a bit intimidating even though its easy as  now
this proposal is dog mlyp

tldr this is a buff to battleships in general not blaster ships nothis makes little sense this doesnt help blaster boats other battleships get an identical boost to their mwd capability and capacitor as well if you wish to buff blaster boats you really need to buff something unique to blaster ships namely the blasters or the ships in question themselves this would essentially just be a buff to battleships in general improving their influence on range control versus other ship types andor improving their capacitor usage as far as i know battleships overall are not in need of a buffbasicallyno
quite a contentious issue that with some pretty vocal parties on both sides of the argument i originally posted this in the sm forum when i was trying to come up with a more constructive response than just shooting down the op suggestion but decided i actually liked the idea enough to put it forwards hereim generally against the idea of requiring fuel to use a cloak or heavily nerfing the ability of ships designed for covert use to remain undetected for relatively long periods of time that said i dont really see a problem with reducing the ability of noncovert ships to remain cloaked for long periods or having some limit  logistical requirements for covert ships i can just about see a workable compromise solution by combining heat mechanics with a special bay not fuel but waste matter on covert ship classes it would go something like thisfirst well start off with the mandatory tenuous rp technical explanation not sure if this in with existing material or not and its certainly not meant to be completely free of physics holescloaks work by controlling the radiative emissions of a ship this is not an energy neutral process requiring the retention of more energy than that emitted this results in the gradual build up of heat covert ship classes get around this by having their designs based around a massively complicated bit of kit known as an energymatter converter mk2 apparently the mk1 was a disaster resulting in the instantaneous destruction of the prototype ship when it produced almost 300 million times more mass than was predicted this uses the excess heat to produce waste matter that is stored in a specially constructed matter production and containment chamber that can only be safely accessed using the fitting services of a stationposcarrier allowing them to make extended use of any cloaking device fitted to the shipnow weve got the dodgy tech explanations out of the way heres the mechanicsactive cloaks build up heat at a rate that is likely to start causing damage after a couple of minutesin a covert ship this heat will be converted to matter and stored in the waste matter bay assuming that there is space covert ships should have space for maybe 2448hrs of cloak operationthe waste matter bay requires the use of fitting services to be emptiedthe falloutyou can still use a cloak on any ship dont need to buy mine or remember to bring fuel if youre in a covert ship and your waste matter bay is full you should still be able use you cloak enough for travel purposes to go and get it emptied in relative safety unless youve let it burn outnoncovert ships cant afk cloak you should be able to manage a pee break without your cloak taking heat damage and with some safespot warping and nanite paste usage you might be able to wait out some hostiles long enough to either get some help or until they get bored waiting if youre not a particularly tasty target if youre trying to rat covertly in hostile territory though youre probably going to need to bring a shock horror covert shipcovert ships can still akf cloak but do have to leave hostile systems occasionally most covert players probably arent going to be particularly inconvenienced by the logistics requirements unless theyre engaged in 237 ging adding some minor logistical requirements to doing this deep in hostile territory is no bad thing imoby a combination of happy coincidence and design this generally uses existing mechanics although i have my doubts that this particular combination can be achieved without some coding workpscan we also get a strikethrough formatting option on the forum the lack of this feature tragically prevented me from working and evolutionintelligent design gag into the last sentence

ive thought about this for a while and i believe a dedicated subcap drone platform that spans across all races is necessary now i understand that most races have a couple of ships that more or less provide them a sufficient drone platform but not a specific t2 variation of drone ship with the exception of things like the curse and the ishtari propose the construction of dropships likely based on the battlecruiser hull require di 5 bc 5 and leadership 5 though those are just ideasin addition to the creation of dropships one would also need to create micro drone control units these modules would be specifically tailored for use by dropships and maybe you could slap one or two on battleships like the dominix and the typhoonthese ships would not be able to fit turretslauncher hardpoints and would actually only have very few high slotsgallente variation based on myrmidon hull3h  4m  5lbonuses5 increase in damage dealt by drones per level of dropships5 increase in armor repair amount per level of dropshipsthe gallente variation would have tight grid and cpu more or less tailored around active armor tankinga maximum drone bay of lets say 200m3 and a maximum drone bandwidth of 175this would allow this ship to field 7 heaviessentries and a maximum of 8 mediumssmallscaldari variation based on drake hull3h  5m  4lbonuses5 increase in damage deal by drones per level of dropships5 increase in shield repair amount per level of dropshipsthe gallente variation would have tight grid and i do mean tight the shield alternative to the gallente version also offering the caldari a good subcarrier drone platforma maximum drone bay of 200m3 and a maximum drone bandwidth of 175this would allow this ship to field 7 heaviessentries and a maximum of 8 mediumssmallsamarr variation based on harbinger hull2h  3m  6lbonuses75 increase in damage deal by drones per level of dropships75 increase in armor resistances per level of dropshipsthe amarr variation would have a larger grid than its caldarigallente counterparts and a fairly respectable cpu as well it would be more focussed in buffer and would have a larger base armor than the gallente versiona maximum drone bay of 200m3 and a maximum drone bandwidth of 175this would allow this ship to field 7 heaviessentries and a maximum of 7 mediumssmallsminmatar variation based on hurricane hull2h  5m  5lbonuses75 increase in damage deal by drones per level of dropships75 increase in shield resistances per level of dropshipsthe minmatar variation on the hull would focus on shield buffer and would also have a larger base shield the grid would be tight but the cpu would be ample in addition to this it would be the fastest and most numble of the 4 dropships with gallente being a close second followed by caldariminmatara maximum drone bay of 200m3 and a maximum drone bandwidth of 175this would allow this ship to field 7 heaviessentries and a maximum of 7 mediumssmallsthe effective exchange for the minmatar and amarr being able to control 1 less smallmedium would be that they would have much larger buffers in addition to this it would make sense for the sensor strength of these ships to be quite weak lets say on par with battlecruisersized marauders this would stop them from being complete frigate eaters as theyd be susceptible to jamming and while drones may continue to fight even when their base ship is jammed they become unable to go after specific targetsin addition to this while the minmatar ships may be the most nimble of the 4 the ship range in general would be quite slow they also wouldnt invalidate the use of ships like the ishtar or gila as these ships would have significant signature radii as well as lack the evasive capabilities of the ishtar or gila nor the domiphoon
so basically a micro carrier without the logistics abilityalso your numbers are off  150 drone bandwidth will only allow for 6 heaviessentries  25 each regardless of how many dcus you put on the shiplike carriers you really wouldnt want to use them solo but i could see them being of use in fleet fightsthe real problem is that theyre already overshadowed by the drone boats  the dominix can carry twice the amount of drones even it cant launch as many at a time  and your allowance of the micro dcu on battleships overcomes that limitation  while having more survivability and offering decent logistical capability in a fleet support rolei like the idea of a sub capital carrier just because i like carriers but i dont know that this ship offers enough as presented distinction from other ships already available to make it viable to fill that role
indeed i adjusted the math i think adding 1 or 2 highs across the board while lowering the cpu of minny and amarr ships to accomodate the numbers would be better allowing for the provision of logistic support possible logistic bonuses could be incorporated such as reduction in capacitor use for remote reps etc
for a t2 myrm this all sounds like my personal wetdream however i honestly dont like the idea for the other platforms typically i think of the harbi and the cane as being much more hardhitting roughntumble ships than drone boats id rather see them fall into a category much more like a heavy battlecruiser than a drone platformand a t2 drake just sends shivers down my spine
hehehehe oh yes the day will come when a missile boat will be better then the rest for onceor they can make it like a drake but more of a gank type of deal like bonuses to speed and extreme missle velocity but less flight time yes i see it now the drake that acts like a mach  d
it is called a dominx
id prefer to have them release patches more frequently with smaller change sets per patch and only one yearly expansion

im not sure i like the idea of limiting internal actions according to whether or not youre in combat but i suppose it could work also replacing larger bays should take more timean alternate idea id like to suggest though is1 a cargoholdtodronebay transfer may not be initiated unless there have been zero drones in local space for x seconds2a each cubic meter of drone requires y seconds of transfer time2b transferring a bandwidthsworth of drones requires y seconds of transfer time2c completely filling the whole dronebay at once requires y seconds of transfer time3 drones may not be launched if a cargoholdtodronebay transfer finished in the past z secondsthe parameters x y z can be adjusted personally im thinkingx  60 secondsoption 2by  120 secondsz  60 secondsconsecutiveso a myrmidon trying to fill an empty drone bay without orca support from the moment it lost its last drone would need to wait a minute begin the first transfer of 75 m3 of drones wait 2 minutes for the first transfer to complete begin the second transfer of 75 m3 of drones wait 2 minutes for the second transfer to complete then wait one more minute before launching any drones a total of six minutes for the chosen parametersif we go with x  60s option 2a y  1 sm3 z  60s then the same myrmidon needs 45 minuteslike i said though the parameters can be adjusted but if a fight is dragging on a really long time without the myrmidon or other drone boat having any drones out and its still surviving then it should be able to replace drones midfight from its cargohold

geez you people make things so damn complicated xm3 multiplied by y seconds divided by the third participle ffs somebody has to code that and every extra timer you throw into the game increases lagjust make it like onlining a mod you need 95 cap to load a drone then your cap gets knocked down to 50 or we it is for mods you aint gonna be doing that in the middle of combat and even doing it outside of combat is gonna take a hell of a long time unless you start wasting cap boosters voila problem solved quick and easy and it was already in mentioned in lets see omfg the 1st reply
i like the concept may need some tweaking howeverwhy not a simple  cant be done while targeted like for cloaking you can only reload drone if no one target you so only when you were able to leave or finish a combatyou can add an agression timer to avoid doing this while ennmies are targeting someone else and not you
another idea to complement the previous ones you cant recover or launch drones while reloading any drones out may still be controlled but not recovered now if you happen to lose drones youll have to wait for the reload to end combined with a long reload time this should encourage a more careful approach not just launch drones  reload scoop to cargo whatever doesnt fit back in
i know i have flown up to drones i left behind to chase an enemy or be chased and hit scoop to cargo instead of dronebay it would be nice to be able to jettison them then scoop them into the dronebay or some variation on that theme
yes the new player experience definatly needs to be looked at more i want more subscribers to this game cause more money to ccp  better products from ccpand seriously ive tried to get so many people i know that play games such as wow to play this game they try it and quit almost instantly this game almost prides itself on raping the new players from every angle imaginable i would of quit if i didnt love space ships so much
mostly caldari hybrids but also stinky gallente hybrids if you have to
supporting this the greatest injustice of all time
sure si need some love
heres my two for one fix stealth needs a boost in eve and what stands in its way is local chat intel so1 cloaked ships drop off local chat unless they speak in it or deactivate their cloak2 a little like probing sensor strength determines if a player will show on another players local chat making eccm more useful than it currently is and make it so you dont have to have a cloaked ship to avoid being seen on localof course simply removing local chat would be much easier
im just having trouble figureing out why its against eula to share my account i mean i dont have any need to atm but the question got raised and now im curious i do not see anyway that it could be used as a exploit other then trusting the wrong person but when does that not happen in eve i pay for the account so why cant i do what i want with it
the problem is when the person you let borrow your account sell the characters and assets
well in that situation isnt it my fault if i give someone a freight container of faction mods to hold and they sell it ud think ccp is going to ban them no ccp will say why did u give him a can full of faction mods yea dumb when does it become ccps job to judge that type of situationwho is to blame for this hypocrisy im sure its some fail carebear who plays farmville while he mines that cannot be the reason though ccp isnt that much of a pushover we cant even get descent fixes to the game when all of eve wants it how would they have let this happen
dear ccp i did the creative part of thinking what changes are best in post 191 now go implement them in incarnau can mail me ingame if u want explainations based on the  changes
while i think your individual changes to the ships are ludicrous bos have no fitting issues but the sin and panther suffer from bad bo bonuses granted your general changes are far more interesting bos need more range not much but they still need it 556 ly should suffice personally id like to se the boskill affect jumprange not just jump drive calibration bos need better fuel economy whether that should be adjusted with a larger fuel bay or not doesnt matter to med a handful of bombers and a recon or two usually means a one way ride unless you bring a blockade runner along i dont mind bringing a blockade runner but today you cant sustain longer campaigns without several of them
the individual changes are based on fitting the black ops semi faction in such a way that their bonus gets applied right and doing around 10001100 dps sin gets 950 dps redeemer  panther as dps boats redeemer dps for heavy stuff panther dps for smaller stuff fall off bonus  good tracking look macharial the widow for semi heavy dps vs bigger stuff battleships and stuff and still has a little bit of buffer tank with 3 multi specs the sin is on this way an anti support boat with 10 drones with max skills  a good amount of high and mid slots for supporting its anti support role removing the heavy drones from the other black ops are my explanation to the increase  of damage output to the main weapon group try to fit a sin in its current state with blasters or railguns u will see that it is impossible to even come close to match the other black ops survival ability ehp buffer tank and dps the only way to get it all fit is by fitting 2 t2 ancillary current routers  by that the other black ops get an advantage since they dont have to fit fitting riggs besides that it takes alot of time to apply the dps to the target due slow ogres or fail sentry drone optimal and fall off typhoon base power grid 12500phanter base power grid 12750armaggedon base power grid 16500redeemer base power grid 17000dominix base power grid 9900sin base power grid 8800scorpion base power grid 9000widow base power grid 8800why got a semi hybrid boat 1100 power less than its t1 counterpart while the other black op got 250 500 more while the sin is an armour  hybrid boat that needs allot of power alone for armour plates  hybrid guns shield boats widow doesnt need power as much as armout boats fitting a large armour repair system is not a option because it will take 2300 power 14th to get a 350 dps tank with resists that are lower than a cruiser the capacitor isnt exactly big ether so in short sin needs some individual changes the other individual changes are to balance races more and make black ops more popular they are fun to fly and it is a waste to let such fun pas fellow eve players 
cosmetic only
no
no
no
no
cosmetic onlynote that i consider the plex to remap the stat in the cosmetic only category and only if the free 1 remapyear stay in gameplex for skillpoint will not be in that category
noeverything in game should be available via game play isk or rewards discriminating people by their willingness or ability to pay real money for in game advancement creates a game breaking biasi accept that the plex is necessary to prevent isk sellers but any goods and services in game should be achievable via isk or some sort of reward lpsmicro transactions create issues a players immersion in the game why would one good or service be available in game and another only accessible out of game
cosmetic onlyi would like to buy a jacket or something thatUFFFDs very special
noits ok for me if montly fee will be increased but not anything like this
nomicropayments only for non game breaking mechanics likeship paints bigger body parts incarna 
noit sets a very very dangerous precedent please go tell your marketing department where to shove it
yesyou can already use rmt to buy plex with which to buy charactersskills as well as any ship or module it would seem more intellectually honest to not force people to launder their real life cash through plexs certainly something cosmetic like preincarna racegender change for isk would seem innocuous past that ccp could maintain the facade by selling all the new items for isk it allows the existing rl for game advantage to continue while not breaking the facade for the nonrmt people
nosomeone said it best earlier i didnt sign up to play gunbound
cosmetic and incarna related only
noi could go for a cosmetic only were the subscription fee lowered a tad
the point i was trying to prove was that the gallente blasters have crap for range and the rails have crap for damage and the drones barely supplement the damage the caldari can fall back on there missiles though this issue affects caldari as well
no and no again a useless idea a complete waste of developer resources a million and one things need attention before titillating juveniles becomes a priority
no all of younot even for the lulzalso stop advertising this in corp chat and go back to second life or wherever it is you came from
i think these 2 things are significant
please damage skins 
well
for fsaa it does work but only if both bloom and hdr are turned off my computer can handle it why cant i get those nice bloom effects while also having aa once i figured out how to get aa working i can never go back to how things were eve is just so ugly without aa also have you seen eve with aa on and shaders on low its an eye sore but thats a different point aa should work with all effect on pleasei also like the idea of a hyperspace window opening so it doesnt look like im flying through objects also i think it would be interesting when a bunch of ships warp in and all you see and hear at first is a bunch of hyperspace windows opening up then a whole bunch of ships appear on your screen would definitely bring back some of the terror effects you got with the old cyno jumps
only by idiots who cant pvp i guess thats you then drake is fine not supported
yeah cause shield tanking drone boats have absolutely nothing in common with gallente or caldari
no all other races have their specific damage type bonuses on their missile boats why should caldari be an exception and no because they have more missile boats is not a reasonfyiamarr frigate skill bonus 10 bonus to em missile damage and 5 bonus to explosive kinetic and thermal missile damage per skill levelcaldari frigate skill bonus 10 bonus to kinetic missile damage and 5 bonus to em explosive and thermal missile damage per levelminmatar frigate skill bonus 10 bonus to explosive missile damage and 5 bonus to em kinetic and thermal missile damage per levelgallente do not have missile boats stealth bombers have bonuses similar to theseso i ask again why exactly should caldari be an exception to this
like the idea but totally agree with dek katos post
as per dek katoyou know i used to poke fun of my roommates blizzard auth things all the time i wouldve definitely bought one for eve though ccps got a snazzy logo just waiting for a functional keychain to sit on
supportedyes most problems occur when people are being stupid otoh it is probably easier to change the security than the entire human race and you having done something unsafe and survived does not prove it was safe  be it dui unprotected sx or surfing google first day exploits  adobe and flash are recent favorites where an uptodate machine on a good website can even get malware served up from an advertising network that appears in the sidebarthis will cost ccp money to implement however the reduced customer service costs offset this at some point as the player population grows and humans customer service agentsgms get more expensive and technology gets cheaper the lines will cross if tfa is not already a cost savingsalso note that its not just physical fobs any more iphoneandroidsmartphone applications get around the shipping issuepersonally i would prefer for ccp to be a leader in technology in general and play protection in particular but at least now they should play catchupthe next level is to optionally allow a corpalliance to say that certain roles require a tfa authenticator eg a large alliance could say only characters with an authenticator could be assigned the role that allows disband an alliance the cva disband that was undone probably could have been avoided
for great justice
i liked them too bring em back
sounds like s great option for a microtransaction purchase it is clearly what some people desperately want and it is purely a cosmetic changesupporting plex for engine trails
supporting this thread because engine trails were bloody awesome
yes bring it back
ive arleady forgot about them  1
though i doubt ccp will listen i wish they wouldnt do this but they seem determined to implement microtransactions and while im not against microtransactions for cosmetic purposes as they put it altering the sphr is not a cosmetic changesupported
noo hell no
nooo
obviously
seriously dont start down this road ccp it only ends in a very bad placei guess this is where we find out quite how much the csm means to ccp when this many players disagree with them
really ccp wtf
isnt it sad when the plex for pizza thread has more supports than this one i think so
mmmmpizza
this
a big no to excluding npc corps but supporting otherwisewould tidy things up and as they are already working on new forums nows a good time
you make it sound like this covers every noob it only covers noobs with spare cash or spare time those without either are just  out of luck i guessnot supported
plex for remap is just trading an ingame item for ingame benefits would you be mad if it was cnr for remap or 350m isk fee for remap if you want to whine about microwhatever whine about plex for 15one more available remap would solve my big skill dilema and being able to remap for plex would at least give me some incentive to make isk no wars lately  boring players who have the skills no not the ones you buy with sp to make isk wouldnt have to wait three months to be able to fly a ship they could buy a dozen of right now
no plex is not a normal ingame item it can be bought with real world currency that is the difference if it was a mission reward or some type of ingame event i wouldnt mindpeople are confusing 2 different problems the need for more remaps to make up for newbie mistakes and such and microtransactions in general making remaps a microtransaction item is a bad solution to a legitimate problem like many said it fixes an ingame mechanic by assigning a dollar amount to the solution there are plenty of ways to address the problem with fixes to ingame mechanics or really any variety of eventsi took the time to plan  carefully do my remaps others didnt and are now at a distadvantage but thats what eve is about to plan ahead or suffer the consequences to simply pay 15 to catch up is just lame i understand alot of people that wasted their remaps would look at this as a chance to finally fix their newbie mistakes but it also allows people to plex their way through repeated unlimited remaps to retain the maximum sphour circumventing a game mechanic that has made everyone equal that is that sp cannot be bought with iskreal cash after this those that have the pockets will be able to do soremaps are limited plexing for them will be unlimited or at least they dont seem to have announced an assigned limit to it better solutions perhaps reducing the interval for remaps  adding a 3rd one  allowing a 1time ingame event for it  hell i would be ok with this if they actually limit how many times you cap pay for it with a plex its somewhat fair if you can still earn that isk and get the same treatment but for the average person he will never be able to compete with someone that wants to pay to have an almost perminant ingame advantage in sphrnot supported but i would support a different fix for remaps if you want to create such a proposal
no
hahatrollolol
agreed
lol thats right just keep it nowto avoid the mistake just open starmap then find the bookmark to delete
god noi dont want to reset disbled confirmation to delete bookmark
lol
absolutely
you forgot a most funny one  antidoomsday
this proposal comes up from time to time and it always goes down the same way in flamesthe basic counter argument to this is why would people want to engage in real pvp when you can just do something similar in what is essentially norisk pvpmore than that arenas dont teach the newbie how to assess the battlefield it doesnt tech the newbie about fleet tactics how to fit ships properly because you give them a random ship in your proposal or how to devise a strategy with others ie rr gang ewar gang wolfpack shadow fleet disco gang etc you can only learn all that through the real deal but then again no one will care about any of the above because people will still get to satiate their pvp urges in the arena with no losesnot supportededit spelling fail
how about just cause a civil war in the nc instead
eve is like the ultimate darwinian experiment you either get it or you fall outthe best way to learn to pvp is to join a pc corp and just start flying tacklers rifters rifters everywhere the idea of a vr arena just seems to devalue that aspect of mentortostudent system thats been the norm since eve was releasedreally we just need more people scooping up new people and breaking them in not coddling them around until they dare get their feet a little wetedit follow edfromsales for lulz
eve combat without a chance of loss is like playing poker for peanuts both seem to be just like the real thing at first glance but neither really works
one can only learn pvp by losing ships by making stupid mistakes and learning from thatnot supported since it would never even get close to real pvp
yay cost free pvp yaylets not destroy whats left from the market we endure macros infact they produce lots of high sec mineralsalways want more shut up pvpers you have cheaper ships but if you actually make isk free pvp then who is gonna buy ships modules ammo not supported welcome to the sandbox

amarr ships will be able to use them
now add the total ammount of cap the different ships relative to the cap use of a mwd into your equation and i think bs suddenly wont look that badanyway mwd definately does not need a boost if anything nerf it on frigates imo mwd should be quick bursts of speeds and not perma runned
spoiler frigate with mwd off is a dead frigatesupported because i eat 800s on my tempest like candy since qr i honestly dont see the point of mwds raping cap like they do
rejectedthere is no compromise without the removal of local chat intel as part of the proposal although i will give you that your pooping cloak idea was unique
nothis is a massive change to something that doesnt need changingnot supported
i guess this deserves a response since its the only reply that addresses anything specificlets take the upper bound that i gave for cloak operational ability 48hrsif you play fairly extensively say 8hrs a day you can stay on station for 6 days constantly cloaked for your entire game time before you need to make the trip to either an npc station friendly pos or rendevous with a friendly carrier hardly a cripling logistical requirement sure if you want to spend months hanging around in hostile territory the number of trips might be in danger of reaching double figures woe is me
can you answer a questions pleasea cloaked ship cant do anything to you while it is cloaked if they decloak you can just kill them as they can kill you why is an cloaked player who is afk by your definition a problem
they arent as such these days im more likely to be the cloaked player than than the guy trying to go about his business with a cloaker in system when it was the other way around in the past it was a minor inconvenience at worst and i used to fly setups designed to kill them if i wanted to do some ratting im generally quite happy with the way covert ships function the things that i think could do with a bit of a tweak are the things that are affected by my proposal1 ships that arent designed for covert operations shouldnt suddenly be able to operate for extended periods in hostile territory simply by fitting a single module operating behind enemy lines should be a more specialised operation2 being able to leave an alt in a hostile system 237 with the potential to light a covert cyno at any time is too much threat for too little cost before covert cynos this wasnt really a problem you could jam a system and realistically scout approaching hostiles that were close enough to arrive before you could take down a decloaking tackler its not that i think you shouldnt be able to go in with a covert ship and stay safe and cloaked for a fairly extended period bide your time until the moment is right to drop your buddies on them thats why my proposal doesnt come close to preventing it what i do think is that the threat is now great enough to justify some minor logistical requirements being added
bah wrong character
it will never happen because of the emo rage quit spam that will happen from all the people that use cloaks on noncov ops ships for various reasons and the griefers and gankers that rely on nonprobeable ships to get their rocks off from solo gank roams to ratting in carriers a lot of folks use the cloak to save their hide and they want the status quo to remain unchanged as it benefits their play style they are the risk vs rewards gurus until it effects their risk vs reward ratio and then the whambulance explodes onto the forums like it has for years now
translation u want to fix a problem that u stated u dont have a problem with in the first place by nerfing something else that has nothing to do with what u do have a problem withjust fyi noncovert ships cannot fit covert cyno generators in the first place and how hard is it to watch local jump so compared to soloing or even in general blobbing is so much more balanced in risk vs reward right
sigh ill bitemake 00 local like wormhole local less lag and afk cloaker nonproblem solved
i thought it was clear but point 1 was to do with the excessive covert ability conveyed on a normal hull by the addition of a single module point 2 was to do with the excessive maintained threat potentialeffort ratio that can achieved by covert ships i dont think the threat potential is too large as seems to be the case for the posters of most of the whine threads but i do think that the effort required is too smallobviously thats all in my opinion and im well aware that there are other people that think the right balance should be much further one way or the other i dont think theres much mileage to be had in trying to wholesale change peoples opinions of where the right balance is on this issue what i was hoping to do was to present a new solution that lands somewhere in the middle ground and have a discussion as to the relative virtues and flaws of the way it achieves this people stating that they think the balance is best how it is or with massively nerfed cloaks is fine and all but id much rather people give their opinions about how well  badly the proposal achieves what it sets out to do or pointed out effects on gameplay i havent considered  got wrongthe key differences to most suggestions that ive seen thrown around is that it targets the main areas that currently make cloaks one of the most overpowered modules in the game without really reducing the capabilities of actively piloted covert ships
well the most important point is  are there even enough reasons to warrant the change in first place and if your only issue is that a cloaked player forces you to be more careful while using your system then i have to say  that is not enough reason to change anything on cloaking because you can still use your system anyone who claims that you cant use your system just fails horriblythat said  rat in groups protect your miners bait the cloaky or just move to the next systemyou still havent convinced me
you could do 600675 dps with t2 gardes and have plenty of mids for omnis to get their range out with a rep bonus on the gallentecaldari ones and t2 resists combined with their lower than battleship sig theyd be near perfect l4 runners and nearly worthless for anything else not to mention lag or the lack of space for replacement drones the fact that you only listed 2 bonuses plus the gallente ship being out damaged by amarr and minmatar does not compute very poorly thought out
drones are the specialist wapon of the gallente race and should remain so it is th eone thing that gallente do better than everyone and th edrone spec boats are already there myrmi ishtar and dominixif a spec drone boat was made for every race then gallente would need to be heavily buffed in another area such as making blasters longer range and better damage otherwise this idea just makes gallente ships even less desirable than they are now and lets face it tehre isnt a gallente ship that isnt overmatched by a ship of another race except for their drone abilitytotally not supported
hias much as i would like to say that gallente are the drone gods i always find curse pilgrim hell even phoon being great drone boats  infact a curse will most likely wreck an ishtar also phoon vs domi i guess phoon t2 torps will hurt the domi which can fit neuts yeah nice to counter minmatar or blasters and pray phoon is in point blank rangei would like to see another t2 bc tier 2 hull but not all as minicarriers each faction should have unique bonuses or at least the 2 specs those gained by training the t2 bc skill
didnt we remove the ability to pilot a ridiculous number of drones because of the lag that it createdwhy would we want to go back to that
perhaps they could fix the eos and you could get a t2 myrm 
so we ever gonna find out if ccp had her killed then mysterious disappearance is mysterious
actually darek your the idiot that you accused someone else of being you like paying to beta test other games which is all this basicly iswe are to test their crap for 2 other games no matter how fanboi elite pvers like on the csm claim proven bye statements as csm opposing more pve cause pvps got to many broken parts wtf pvp needs to be nerfed you can do it 30 secs after character creation using their tried and true methods ccp should nerf it its to easy even easyer than mining edited do to being mad at stupid people
yawn go troll somewhere else moron boy better they do it here where they can tweak the code on a platform they understand and have used for years than having to do it on brand new code and manage release day expectations at the same time besides you seem to be forgetting that all these features will also be applied to eve as well oh wait youre a troll you didnt forget at all
yea haahha yawn  the only troll is you as usual you cant debate so you start insulting typical of trolls you can not even defend your own idiotic comments on saying its ok to beta test another game i wouldnt mind it so much if i was not paying for it despite what idiots like you claim its not free you still pay a monthly fee

way to go csm
well the person you share your account with could not have agreed or even seen the eula which could create all kinds of loopholes where 2 people working together could basicly do everything the eula is supposed to preventa could have agreed to eulab could break ita could not be banned because he didnt break the eulab can not be banned because he didnt agree to the eulai dont remember for sure if or when the eula agree question is asked but this could be one reason
that provision is there to make ccps life easierplayer a creates account and does a bunch of stuffplayer a shares account with player bplayer b steals everything or gets the account banned doing something badplayer a cries to ccpccp responds dude it is against the eula to share accounts too bad petition denied
but still how many people have kids that share accounts like a fatherson as an example my only guess is that it might be considered cheating in the way that 1 person runs missions while the other sleeps it makes me think of how a gold farming company works you could in theory have 4 people using the same account that is never logged out that and someone you think you can trust breaking that trust
weve had no issues in turning our bos from covert taxis into dpsboats when needed with the exception of the sin but that is not due to fitting constraints rather than game mechanics its very hard to apply drone dps before a target is evaporated but weve found other uses for it our experience tells us that grid and cpu is enough on all boats for us to do what we please with them but that the specific bo skills are a bit out of order for sin and panther that seems however like a far lower priority than being able to jump and portal some friends to the next door system and back again

isk for  through gtcs is enough i dont oppose to it because im realistic and if ccp doesnt control it then the rmt market would be a black one mostlyto give an xp advantage for  no thanks its lame even in f2p games oh wait eve is already a f2p game for me 
supported i play this game because its hard i play because i love the challenge i play because with risk there is rewarddo not make this what soe not sisters of eve did to swg a care bare game do not make this a care bare game
why has this trend become so popular recent times 
right there is the problem players such as yourself equate plex to rl money nothing could be further than the truth gtcs are bought with money not plex note that when you purchase plex from the eve website you are actually only purchasing multiples of a gtc those gtcs can be used in one of three waysit is used from the players account management area to add time to hisher subscription outside of the gameit is sold outside of the game in the official forum  timecode bazaar  for isk the isk is of course then used ingameit is converted to plex from inside of the game which is then used or sold inside the game but the gtc is purchased outside of the gameyou cannot buy a gtc ingame nor can you buy plex directly with money ingame you buy plex with isk plex properties includesell and buy it on the market for isk and haggle over the priceanyone even the poorest eve player in rl can buy a plexstore it in a hangar container or cargo holdtransport it within a shiptrade it for another ingame itemput it into a contract or use it as payment for a contractgive it to another player to a corporation or to an alliancetransfer it to an altlose it if your ship is destroyed while it is in the cargo holdsalvage ituse it to pay a ransomif you will notice from that list a plex is just like any other game item and just like any and all other game items you cannot buy it with real money ingame you can however just like the gtcs buy a readymade character with skill training in various amounts and with that character you may also get any game item in that characters hangar if so agreed also notice that selling gtcs in the forums is the same as buying isk with rl money that is a lot closer to buying an advantage than is using plex for a neural remap
we equate plex to rl money because that is the only source of creating more plexes i dont know of any other ingame mechanic that allows you to create a plex without having spent cash to obtain gtcs your list covered alot of the plexs properties but as youve pointed out the only way to add to that supply is by spending cash obtaining gtcs and going through the process to turn them into ingame plexes i cannot mission and buy a plex with lp i cant mineharvest one i cant run sites and have a plex drop all other ingame items have a way of creating them within the game itself therefore plex is not a regular ingame item even if it recieves almost the same treatmenteven the news articles use plex prices to backtrack real world cost in evaluating heists or other ingame events involving the destructiontheft of lots of isk even though rmt is technically forbidden and such numbers would be invalid to begin with another example is ccps plex for good campaigns with ccp promising to provide the equivalent real world value of plexs that are donated to a ccp char and thus removed from ingame market supply to humanitarian organisations that is the truth the reality is that plexes have a real world value and as a by product of that so does isk if im not mistaken that was one of the original intents of plexs to begin with to undermine rmt and isk sellers by providing a secure  closed loop system of buying iskbut you know what thats an entirely different issue all together and only one of the reasons i dont support it the biggest reason i dont support this is because it breaks the limit on remaps it doesnt extend it or change it it completely breaks it you can have unlimited remaps for as long as your ingamerealworld wallet can allow that is imo the biggest problem i may agree with you on the value of having a higher amount of remaps to account for newbie mistakes or plan changes or many of the stuff you listed under pros in your proposal or by others that supported this certainly the need for more remaps is there i just believe this would be a terrible solution to it hell its not even a solution its a work around that has a real world value assigned to it however should a limit be implemented i may change my position on this but until then i cannot support it in addition if ccp is using this as the first of possibly more cosmetic microtransactions it does not bode well for the rest of their microtransaction lineup because neural remaps are certainly not cosmetic at all its brain surgery 
the point though sleeperacolyte is that once that plex is ingame anyone can use it not just the person who had the extra cash to buy the gtcs in the first place most players who buy gtcs either apply them directly to their account or sell them in the forums or through the conversion feature those who sell them rarely use them for their own account i know over a 6 month period this past year i sold a lot of gtcs in the bazaar i always had a few billion to share among my accounts for implants highend skillbooks and expensive ships and mods and that gave me a huge advantage over other players when this plex for neural remaps goes live though i will go to buying plex with isk because 1750 a pop for a remap to save a few weeks a year in training is not cost effective in my book i would wager that most sellers of gtcsplex feel the same wayalong that same vein how would this break the remap feature no one in hisher right mind would spend a plex for a remap frequently unless 1you are rolling in cash or 2you have been playing  hoarding your isk for years and are one of the few elite eve rich the common player is only going to be able to use maybe a few a year at mostas for a limit i added that to the proposal shortly after i posted it and id bet ccp has looked at a limit too although i honestly dont believe it will be needed
been teetering on the fence on this issue but i like your perspective on it even though i loathe microtransactionssupported
1 it may certainly seem reasonable to expect people wouldnt spend tons of cash to gain an advantage but that is not always the case there are many examples where people have funded capitals towers ships and character purchases through real cash and didnt think twice about it i know a few and i bet you do to its not that rare a phenomena plus you get 2 plexes for the gtc if im not mistaken so thats already 2 more possible remaps for a single purchase2 a plex may be an expensive item but im sure many people have alts that are completely subscribed through plexes including me so spending them on a semiregular base does not require you to be filthy rich certainly remaps wont be used every other day but if some eve players can manage to get a plex per month i would expect them to be able to afford a remap per month rendering the entire remap system pointless certainly you can seperate your plan into monthlong remaps or maybe 2month long to save isk and youd still maintain an almost perfect sph ratio that is how the lack of a limit would break this mechanic it effectively introduces power leveling into eve
meh why not besides its not like these proposals every amount to anything ever theyre about like entries in the features  ideas recycle bin subforum
lol true actually since ccp has already stated that plex for neural remaps will be in the winter expansion this is nothing more than a discussion on the issue as is the no proposal still its nice to get a few more supporting it even though the nays are waaaaay out in front due to fears of an unfair advantage and gamingbreaking mts to follow i just dont see either one happening personally
well there is the vain hope that some ccp developer will read all this and perhaps take it into account as constructive critique if not at least the strong backlash against this may influence future offerings of cosmetic microtransactions that modify game mechanics i would be much more ok with this with a limit in place but im more worried about these types of situations happening again and having to debate other microtransactions that blur the line between vanity item and modifying existing game mechanics at the end of the day ccp is going to do whatever it wants and whatever makes business sense
very much like xp scrolls in other games not supported the whole remap thing is screwed in its basis why not remaps every 24h cooldown

things change in eve all the time ships equipment parts pi we are here to try and make eve better not worse any ideas suggestions in doing that should always be looked into pros vs cons i support this i feel it would benefit everyone as well
i support as well it would be nice to see a new exhumer that can defend against attacks not saying invulnerable but at least give us a fighting chance
i support this and agree not for use in empire does not exceed current times love the mining crystal bay do not agree with sending direct to a orca i would like to see it as a gathering all in one rock gas iceit needs to be earned not obtainable quickly its an achievement the pinicle of your career
currently the tactical overlay has four points with range lines i would think it would be relatively straight forward to mark one of the four points with either a colour or an arrow this would make returning the camera point of view much more straight forward for example when using the overview while flying an interceptor it can be disorientating as the camera in spun in order to double click in space having a visually fixed point in space would certainly aid flying many shipsneuro
if i have this right that will hide everything i would like to be able to click and target items or have them identified with a label on mouseover or something to that effect what say you all
this proposal is to add mines and minefields into the game if you have ever seen star trek ds9 you know what im talking aboutthe idea is to anchor a mine into space the same way you can anchor a cargo container there will be two types of mines a basic mine and a cloaking mine the cloaking mine will be cloaked and when a ship gets near 2500m it detonatesa player will be limited to only anchor a set amount depending on skillsto build a minefield player will have to work with othersonce anchored the mine can not be unanchoreddamage to that of the current bombs00 and wh onlyalso there could be a new ship that is a mine layer it will jettison mines by targeting a section of space needs a ui or a 3603 arch jettison
i can see there being a lot of trouble with this what is stopping a couple of corps of say 20 or so people each locking down systems by sticking a few of these around gatesalso i thought they removed mines due to the lag they caused in the first place
mines can not be placed within 25k of a gate mines if uncloaked can be targeted and fired on there is a module that can see cloaked mines and allow you to target them
actually they moved mines because of the concord response ieyou place a mine and then go back to high sec someone trips your mine and you get an aggression flag concord omgwtfbbqs you because you illegally aggressed someone
oh ffs this is the third thread ive seen this month having to do with mines and minefields learn to use eve searchthat said eve used to have mines but were taken out due to lag ever seen how much lag 20 anchored cans cause imagine 100s now imagine those 100s of cans each with its own bit of code that interacts with 100s of other players concord if you set up mines in lowsec and some neutral gets hurt by them while you are in highsec concord will deal swift justice it works in reverse too you set them up in highsec and then escape to lownullsec to avoid the wrath of concordnote your proposal states that they would only be usable in 00 and wspace thus negating this reasonmy own personal take on it i personally like the idea of mines but looking at how to 00 alliances operate i can honestly say that this idea will be used abused and then some it would essentially be a lazymans way of defending chokepoints and vital system without need for a manned defense
so you want afk killingwhat will happen people place a few mines around a warpin on a belt some ratterroaming person warps in and gets bbqed by the minescombine that with the afk cloaking whine we got alreadyalso  in the past it happened that people placed too many mines and people started lagging badly on jump in and then funny things happened like gms moving whole fleets past the gate camp with the minesall in all  not really useful  we dont need afk killing thumbs down
mines already exist ccp simply removed the ability to use them because they were terrible things to have in the game go out and search contracts for things like anaconda mines
you cant search for them but well they do exist
ok i know this topic its not useful in anything but i think i could give a nice idea to the future aesthetic of the gamethere should be a animation and sound to outside ships entering and exiting warp for example if you dont get it yetyou in a random place and your friend just happen to entering warp to go to a station so in his tail you see some nice quiet and cute exotic particles that appear everytime you see someone going away also if you didnt saw him you hear a low and kinda subliminal sound that tell you that somebody went to warp and was near you like 30km max could be as quiet as a shot of a dronealso when you still in that random place of yours you hear another distinct sound but as quiet as the other one and you subconsciously know that someone just came from warp and its near you like 30km max again not very close or far maybe it dosent need animation in that because its comming from ftl or who knowsand the better thing its that you could turn off the effects as everything else right apart that will help people that are multitasking who isnt in eve please give me a hands up i am starting to like the ideapd this idea came from seeing stu in case you wanna see a reference but creativity its better that copypaste
signedcompletely outside of the eve standardmust have people from different game backgrounds working on this
im not sure if this is the right section for this or if its been asked but as a industrialist i would like to know if it is possible for a balance sheet to be available for the wallets profit loss statements etc this may seem far fetched but for those of us that love the market and want better tracking of performance and sales it would be a god send also i would like to propose wallet divisions for everyone not just corps are either of these viable i would appreciate feedback either for or against and there reasoning cheers
thats the reason why it will never be implemented being able to tank concord  permaban
bad idea for various reasons
actually i spent nearly a month on an unafilliated alt asking hundreds upon hundreds of empire dwellers that avoid pvp why their answers were routinely in the same areas they avoid pvp because they are unfamiliar with it and the only way to break in according to the playerbase is to lose a  pile of ships in the name of experience the vast majority of these people really dislike the idea and find the whole concept of simply throwing away assets in that way un fun theres a reason most of the eve playerbase still lives in high sec pvps only way to learn is bashing your head against a wall until suddenly it makes sense you people can spout survival of the fittest all you like but it makes no difference its bad game design to leave entry into one of your most advertised features completely missing from a game but people will continue to spout that it would ruin pvpruin the sandbox etc when this would be constraining enough that the individual player would eventually want for more since they didnt even have control over their team ship fitting etc in these scenarios would a group of people still play them 247 of course would this detract from current meaningful pvp haha no
so you practically say that they dont pvp because someone blobs them or they dont want to spend isksolutions i join a bigger blob alliance than the one that blobed you ii fly t1 cruisersfrigates until you are familiar enough to use bc iii grow balls pick your fights iv dont expect to be a omfg pvp god because you fly a 8b vindicatorranked stats in eve are killboards and they track the big arena of eve universe
while valid points obviously your suggestions arent good enough since these avenues have been available to every eve player since its inception and yet we still have the vast majority of eve players avoiding pvp maybe its time to admit the systems broken eh
i say nay just improve faction warfare
a few years ago ccp did plan to do some kind of simulated pvp before anyone shouts at me i know that real pvp is still simulated because it is a game after all  they got as far as doing some work on it before paraphrasing the cluster became self aware and utterly rejected the code or something to that effectpersonally i dont see the value of risk free pvp on tq instead i suggest you fire up the spiffy new sisi client install tool and play on there where pvp is supposed to be by consent other than in a few free for all areas in one system and everything costs 100isknot 100 the same thing as your idea i admit but you can do it right now
another valid opinion but again it has been around nearly since eves inception and obviously has done nothing for the literally thousands of eve players who have not initiated themselves into pvp despite having a desire to
and here you have exposed the biggest problem people have in entering pvp risk aversionto do pvp is more of a mental leap than anything else you have to be willing to risk and sometimes lose ships in the interest beating other players even socalled blobbing doesnt guarantee safety as there will always been a bigger blob and in some cases better tactics that will counter yoursto create a riskfree pvp environment wont change this people will still be riskadverse and wont want to lose ships because well whats the point
a lot of the risk aversion from what i have come to understand through a month of conversation comes from the unwillingness to lose their ships without realizing why this would give them a basis of experience to work from giving them confidence to go out and at least try because they have gotten their feet wet again only suggesting this because the existing mechanics have obviously failed us
but you dont learn anything by being given a random ship that you have no idea how to fly or what tactics to use in the first placeand assuming that people do learn how to pvp through this why would they want to then go out and lose real ships that cost real isk when they can keep going back to the simulation and lose nothing people will still be risk adverse whether or not they know how to pvp unless they can get over the fact that there will always be a chance of real death in real pvpas far as the mechanics are concerned those are fine more blame is to be put on the majority of pvpers who dont wish to spend time training up people who cant get over that mental block of losing ships believe me ive tried my hand at this and have been constantly frustrated in my efforts due to this block
you would learn the exact same things you learn on sisi and you would want to go do real pvp for the same reason people dont only pvp on sisi but do in fact pvp on tq as well your logic is incredibly flawed since we have a living and breathing example of what i speak of that hasnt killed pvp in eve yet
i dont think this is a good idea battleships should be significantly slower than cruisers and frigates this is not longer the case if bs perma mwd around 1000ms or even more
i can already mwd around forever if i bring enough 800s with me all it means is i have to bring my prowler alt with me if i go to 00 with it an annoyance rather than limitation
everything that boost blaster boats i supportps while your at it fix gallente ships guns and mods too
okay i bothered to check itif we just look at raw cap and ignore regen t1 mwds all lvl 5 skills on everything1mn mwd uses 33 energy incursus has 406 so 810mn mwd uses 135 energy thorax has 1719 so 8100mn mwd uses 540 energy megathron has 7031 so 8if you look more accurate you see it even decreases slightly so now the difference is mainly that frigates have much higher relative cap regen than battleships the energy cost of mwds compared to their total amount of energy is equalimo still mwds are supposed for quick bursts of speed not perma running that is what abs are for and no that wont mean insta death for all frigs since they can still be dual prop and one of the main reason ab frigs fail now is that their target just permaruns mwd and lowers transversal to zero also with ab they are way harder to track imo definately not needed especially because it is another nerf to blaster ships i dont really see how it would be a boost as some apparently think blaster ships have no reason to permarun their mwd they burst into range and then webscram their target and deactivate their mwd making it easier to permarun mwds will be mainly a boost to minmatar bs and mostly a nerf to gallente bs since it becomes much easier to kite blaster ships
which again was a fault of some idiotic ccp employee thinking balance meant making damage higher on projectile ships this balance would have made far more sense and been far better reaching to affect bs than just boosting minmatar damage would have been it would have reestabolished the old parameters set for minmatar where intentionally had lower dps but better speed and cap superiority i cant help that ccp ed up minmatar but this change is still neededsure mwd is meant for a quick boost of speed explain to me how a blaster boat is going to perma run an mwd after this change when you add in their gun cap usage webscram cap usage and any possible negative effects such as nosneut and oh yeah there is that pesky effect that a warp scram has on mwd to did you forget let me refresh k warp scramblers are  2 points and kill mwd so before you keep saying omg permamwd read the op in detail and realize that your argument is very near sightedhave you noticed how in the past 6 months to a year there has been a strong movement away from bs in general
would be nice if there was a bomb for stealthbombers that could be used for diableing cloaks for like 10 seconds within 30kmradius of it exploding
i had a whole rant going for this but the forum ate it oh well going with the simple replyno
you meanlike these
you are the scout of your fleet and run ahead in your covert ops you jump into a gate camp bubble goes up as normal you align out of the bubble hit the mwd and recloak the 30km decloak smart bomb goes off and decloaks you the dramiel tackles you and you get killed and poddedeffort for them none chance of your survival 0 while atm you got a decent chance of running the gate camp and they have a decent chance of killing youyou can replace your covert ops with recons or blockade runners all 3 ship classes specifically created to run camps and you would basically have destroyed their rolesand gate camping is really the last thing that needs a buffthat said  not supported
running a gatecamp vs decloaking a covops is one of the few remaining examples of individual player skill in eve you want to replace that with press button  receive killmailno get out shut up never post again

i agree that specific electronics subsystem is useless but im torn as to whether or not making it a drone bonused subsystem is the way to go since the drone offensive subsystem should be where you get the drone power from however i cannot currently think of anything better besides a faster lock time as previously mentioned but thats not really better just different so this has my support if only to give the proteus more attention and thus hopefully a boost
go do that then if its so easy
the skillbooks will be sold in any station that sell the exumer skillbook so they will not be a outer ring exclusivitythe bpo will not be a great isk maker the ship will be rarely lost and some hundred bpo used constantly will cover the demand easily the price will be out of the roof the first month at worst then the overhead on the bpo sold in jita will be a 20 max nice gain but nothing terrific
having a regional forum with one forum by region in 00 would help perhaps making theses area of space more dynamical mainly i bet ppl will post trading stuff or direct regional recruitement or sucheven could be done for low sec but as there is no point doint empire region forum i think as low sec regions have empire like area it would have less sense

lol yesremove it i hate this effect it hurts my eyes tbh there dont need to be a sb effect at all
these effects serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever please separate the actually relevant effects people care about like dictor bubbles and remote repair from the useless ones like sensor boosters and eccm i really dont care if your ship can lock me 50 faster so why does the game need to look like ass to show it
supported current sensor boostereccm effects make my eyes bleed for no good reason the old sb effect wasnt at all subtle but was at least ignorable now its like a ing disco light show or something
1 excessive way to contradict yourself in your attempt to whine about cloakseven though u admittedly switched to the wrong character by accident it was still u so u were saying something about being clear 2 u mean this threat potential that can be easily dealt with by watching local the same way one would detect threats coming in from a stargate ok explain how a covert cyno warping in covert ships that r weaker than their t1 counterparts r so much more of a threat that u need a nerf so bad compared to noncovert ships coming in through a stargate seriously what is your opinion or least can u even make up your mind on what your opinion is first u say its no problem at all and now its too much for u fyi this is the assembly hall where ppl take one stance and stick with it to push a proposal through not become wishywashy in brainstorming for just an idea for a proposalok this time u say its overpowered despite the fact that again the covert ships themselves were designed to be weaker than their t1 counterparts u got any other excuses we all know your wishywashy proposal is nothing more than another one of the whine threads u mentioned i get it u dont look wanna look stupid by not taking a firm stance and defending it guess whatit aint working

you may like ankh or may hate her it doesnt matter anymoreas former csm all i can say is that ankh was in her way passionate for her task as csm and it doesnt matter anymore if you agree or disagree on her ways and viewsshe did 2 full terms and a short part of the 5th council x 20hours work a week invested in csm totals around 1500hoursim sure that being removed from csm for ankh personally had to be very painfulwhat i personally dislike are the people that keep bashing and kicking people that are already knocked out on the floorwhy cant yall just stop stirring up the  and let this topic endrespectfullyextreme
i would agree this is flogging a dead horse that has already left the barn which long since caught fire and burned to the ground that said the real dissappointment is that so many people failed to see ahnk was all about ahnk and nothing else many folks tried to warn the voters but were overwhelmed by the voices of the missinformed fanboys no one that worked with ahnk in her first csm terms wanted to work with her again she was like a spoiled child when she didnt get her way and some of us tried to let folks knowalthough she may have worked a lot and had passion for her efforts i think she was net negative to the online social experiment in virtual goverment that the csm is it is interesting though she managed to create such a large cult of personality about her claim to represent the carebears when clearly she never was able to with any effectiveness i think one thing any csm would tell you that no matter what your views of eve might be to be an effective member of the csm you have to play well with other members of the csm to make sure the csm can present a unified voice to ccp when needed ahnk never learned thati can say i am sure her removal from the csm must have been crushing for her personally she is the sort of person that will remain bitter and angry about that for the rest of her life if there really was an nda issue she might have also suffered a career set back that could haunt her for some time she is also clearly no longer involved in the greater eve community in any manner and this was one of her favorite places to mine large volumes of hot gasses that maintained the size of her ego nothing wrong with a large ego makes for some fun times in the context of internet spaceships so everyone should realize she really paid a price for whatever ccp decided she did i think way more than most eve players would have under similar situationsso what i hope folks take from the while thing isnt just about ahnk id hope if there is a lesson or two its that ccp does take the nda seriously as well as other aspects of the conduct of the csm and that when voting for a csm candidate try and pick someone that seems to be able to work with other folks to be effective at representing you to ccpissler
and for that monthly fee you get access to the servers storage of your characters stats ships isk and equipment plus free additional content whenever ccp releases it how much did they add to the subscription fee when they announced incarna oh thats right jack and  so that arguement is false right from the getgoso lets clear things up youre complaining about a free feature that will not only improve eve but also allow ccp to make more money through other games pretty sure most of that extra money will go into ccps flagship title which is wait for it eve onlinebut hey i know you wont pay any attention to that because youre a trollpeace
sigh  ill try one more time troll leave your mothers house and get a job or quit living off someones tax money  no the money will go into those games proving how stupid you really are exactly how is making a pretty character and walking on a station going to help a space ship game none again how stupid you are for a flagship part of the company they sure are investing allot of effort into fixing bugs in eve arent they whats worse your one of those idiots that think because you mined the ore the minerals are free enough time wasted on some kid trolling i would actually like to see black ops worked on as well not sure how thru never seen one used for anything other than cynos and to aggravate people bye afk cloaking heck i am still waiting on rockets t be fixed after 5 years or so so i figure dec 21 2012 maybe they will do some work edited ah heck why worry with this anymore samething on these forums either a troll or a fanboi starts ranting its getting not worth the effort to even read forums

i kinda feel bad for ccp as no matter what they do itll be wrongas someone who uses plex to extend my account id rather it not used for more things in the game i would use it if it were implemented but raising the value of it is not in my personal interest while i understand that adding items to the game that cost isk in essence add to the potential value of a gtc directly adding more value to a plex hurts the players who strictly pay for their accounts using them this can cause issues with people who struggle to pay their accounts this way and may actually hurt the subscriber base who uses time codesplex to play this is all speculative as gtc prices keep going up isk wise and i could be completely wrong im pretty sure its been suggested but in my opinion it should just be a hefty fee you pay to a medical facility to remap that or a player manufactured item the drama around microtransactions can easily be masked by just adding items to the game that arent directly related to the gtcplex system furthermore if i were ccp i know im not  but id leave the whole gtcplex system alone and do my best to not touch it period the system works and is pretty ingenious doing anything to it may break it i grasp that ccp is working hard to restore the ui back to a usable state would you mind asking them when they plan on finishing it up back to something thats just a little less frustratinganother question i had was about mail why is this new mail system so hosed at the moment 5 minutes to load mail and typing a mail is one of the most broken aspects of eveanyway good luck in iceland i hope you guys are able to recover from hangovers to keep on the ball with these meetings

they could have asked the csm and gotten the answer without upsetting the player baseeg were thinking of expanding plex use  mtplex is a controversial topic  lets ask the csmsimple
we made this point to many different people in many different meetingsultimately ccp will do what they feel is best ignoring csm players etc if they wish but at least they could have had some idea of how badly this was going to be received and maybe got a more coherent message out before everyone in their opinion jumped to conclusions
maybe to stop you from paying someone real  to grind for you
iirc in this specific instance you may share an account if for no other reason than it is impossible to prove that you didspeaking as a long time eve player my advice is this dont give your password to anyone
i say no bad idea however i am all for neral remaps being available with a special kind of plex or something via mirotransaction say available 6 monthly

ccp stop wrecking the few good things left about your game
no or incarna cosmetic onlyas long as current subscription fees are maintained i have no complaints paying a dollar here and there in a game that is free to play if the game requires subscription fees my fees should provide me with the ability to access all content whether or not i can actually do something useful with the content is irrelevant

the rejection was for the simple reason that the proposal didnt contain any content go read it there is no content besides fix hybrid weaponsa better proposal would take the discussion from the blasters 20 thread and write it up as a formal proposal to the csm that would get my vote in the next wave of group review or crowdsourcingand trebor crowdsourcing is awesome even if only as a means of providing the populace with bread and circuses 
there were better posts for rails and blasters as you point out csm did respond by saying ccp said they are aware of the situation already and it was kinda left in ccps hands to sort out hybrids a good fix would likely be something more radical than messing with range or dps an example is how they turned projectiles from worst in the game to a good weapon ignoring the more range more dps clamor from projectile users on the forums train lasers or projectiles and theyll get to hybrids eventually ive trained up both while waiting for hybrids so i can patiently wait for hybrids to be worth using compared to alternatives again
its not the eye candy that makes me want to play eve its the games mechanics you can have the most visually stunning game in the world where everyone is like ooooh aaahhh for a couple months but if the gameplay is bugged its life expectancy is not going to be long i think there are more important aspects that need to be focused on first in saying that the fact that we will be redesigning our toons in the new expansion should give you an indicator that these things are being addressed in due course
this game caught a lot of attention for being pretty then it got grittier well gritty can be pretty too so lets bring the pretty back in the form of boom boom

i support this but more as a step on industrial modules for tech3 than a simple mining subsystemwould like a subsystem allowing something like 24000m2 like a transport ship
i like the idea of a very survivable mining vessel but perhaps making it have a very low sig radius instead of high warp strentgh since a mining vessel spends relative long time stationaryit shouldnt be impossible to scan just very hard so it will take both skill and determination to locate it if the pilot has taken taken the option of fitting for itusing implants etcimo the ship should come close to the hulk 7590 of a hulk at max  if fitted for max yield but have the option for fitting for high survivability at the expense of mining yieldsince the main defence would be a low sig radius and relative high agilityspeed it should be a relative small vessel and nimble vessel with a relative small cargo hold more and less forcing it to work as part of a mining team with either an orca or a hauleri believe this could make for some fun and profitable gameplay playing cat and mouse with the typical low sec and wh inhabitants

hello alli have started this topic as instructed by ccp in response to a petition i started about a week ago after much time doing alliance logo design for many friends as a whole we have decided that its about time ccp adds the feature for custom designed corp logos as well but it is not something that we can get accomplished without the support of the eve members so i am starting this thread in hopes of getting peoples feedback and support to push for this feature for those eve members who are not sure what the custom logo feature is for alliances it can be viewed at this link
seriously its clearly the dumbest idea to give these ships a armor rep bonuscap using active tank mwd guns and tackle means disaster most blaster ships dont have enough power grid to fit anything better than wimpy electrons when trying to fit armor reps id like to see a blaster ship maintain tank and gank without chewing through cap boostersall blasters should have a mwd cap reduction bonus that makes them cap stable with mwd this should balance the playing field a bit in my opinion
i agree actually most amarr ship get a laser cap reduction bonus and i think the gallente should have to suffer a cap reduction bonus too 
is this really a request for ccp to look at blastersblaster boats overalltheres a thread on this forum dealing with the issue already blasters 20
the problem will be replacing an existing bonus with that one which would be bad 
about 2 years ago we received a very sweet expansion package called apocrypha this shiny new expansion or patch as you call it brought us tech 3 since then we fell in love with them now 2 years after that tech 3 is still loved and used universwhile in eves world but the time has come to upgrade the tool ccp gave usits time to get more tech 3imagine a tech 3 battleship roaming in level 45 missions or a tech 3 frigate pass by you like a lightning bolt imagine a tech 3 covert ops geared battleship fleet using their short jump drive and attack the enemy from the behindopinions and suggestions are welcome trolling and cool story bro like replies are not tolerated
putting this in your op is like waving raw meat at a pack of hungry dogs you know that rightthat aside i would love to see more tech iii ships  especially battleships since those are some of my favorites
there was talk about a year ago on forums of a desire for t3 frigates if memory serves me right a dev even replied with a wed like to do this soon kind of response i would support a new t3 frigate as i did in the previous thread t3 battleship i dont know maybe some day
ultimately i think we will get more tech iii ships but probably after incarna ccp has alot of stuff on their plate with the next two expansions that i kinda doubt theyve made room for tech iii
i would much rather see a tech3 battleship than a tech3 frigate
the frigate range is already completely saturated with half of the existing ships outclassed theres basically no reason to ever fly an electronic attack frigate most of the assault frigs half of the faction ships or the vast bulk of the t1 range massively customisable t3 frigates would only serve to make this problem worse with even more overlap between available shiptypes and even more of the existing frigates made obsolete by the new additions
as we know eve is a fairly timeconsuming game it is not uncommon for oe to spend six hours straight in front of his computer playing eve during this tyme you most likely will have to alttab be it skype youtube or whatever fullscreen does not make it easy window mode helps but the borders around the screen are annoing alot of new games now have borderless window mode in this mode switching to other applications is instantand it also allows multymonitor setups to be used to their full potential
use evemon it makes windowmode to look like fullscreen
either a north or ship heading indicator would be useful for those occasions when im zoomed out far enough to not be able to see my ship

yup the tactical overlay is not please upgrade it also the white spot should report the actual distance from target ty
there are some other possible solutions to mines1 require a corp ship to be on grid and be connected to the mine for it to be active like the way drones work  so no cloaky mine layers2 make mines have a high sig radius so they become bc killers kinda like bombs3 use standard anchoring range limits 2500m or we it is to prevent stacking mines4 allow mines to be damaged by smarties and bombs and targetable by other weapons5 if you want to make mines cloak then give dessies an anticloaking pulse also in database iirc incidentally this would help shut up people who whine about cloakers and give dessies a role
no
it is a bit backasswards
definitely more illustrious effects never hurt i also support everything that other guy said tooespecially that 3pointcurve around planets while warping
hithis issue has been brought up several times in similar ways but in the light of incarna and with the new character creation it should be reviewed againwhile the old intro was not really informativ from a sandboxpointofview it explained the lore and how the factions became what they aremaybe it could be added as an optional video with an icon just above the faction symbols in the new creation so that every new player could watch if he is not sure which race to choose
i miss that old video and i agree that it should be available as a background for race selection
i remember that the old intro gived me the most powerfull sensation when aura said destiny rightfully yours and the screen when pitch black with the white eve online letters i was so omgomgomgomgomg that thing made me keep in trial until i found my corp
sounds good but idk about the animations but i like the idea of knowing that someone went or came from warp without having to check hard the overview all the time and isnt gonna make jita worse
the two camps i can think of are star trek versus star wars warp animations in star trek a ship exiting or entering the grid is accompanied by a bright flash of light in star wars the ship simply disappears  just like the current eve mechanicyes id love to have aura provide some kind of audiovisual alert of ships nearby entering or leaving warp perhaps exiting via warp would be accompanied by a pop sound like water closing in around a hole while ships entering warp would be accompanied by a splurk sound like a drop of water hitting a concrete surface or a soap bubble popping i only think of these since were dealing with the creationdissipation of warp bubbles 
still there no sounds in space but it would be great for the science fiction aspect of the video game dont forget going at sound speed make crazy noise how about a warp speed it same thing but its a good idea like you in fleet and hearing enemy fleet warping to you would be nice effects
sounds awsome p
i would like to request strong consideration that commanders can enter into a training mode against other players in their own corporation the training mode would allow members of corporations to engage other members within their corporation in certain operations i understand that a commander can opt to take missions from factionsagents and i like that ability but most militaries have a train as you fight protocol in training commanders are tasked to use their best ability to overcome a enemyin eve we do not have this ability that i know of although programming is not a simple task i think it can be done with great benefit of the commanders and corporations in the combat mode there would be a failsafe mechanism that prevents a commander from destroying the ship of the other commander it is even possible with a bit of programming effort that a postcombat analysis program would be generated that evaluates the action of all commander involved in the training exercise this is not a priority though your thoughts and guidance on elevating this please
hiits called sisisingularitytest server dtake your corp and practice pvp there or arrange a few corps to get some blob fights read rulez about what is allowed i think they dont allow t2 rigs  scaps but im not sure
i have recently bought up bpos and find it difficult to keep track of all the bpos i have and have on occasion bought multiple copies accidentilyi feel that it would be useful if the market would note if you already have it in a similar way to the skills
actually all they need to is add a search feature to the blueprints tabs in sci  ind then you could easily see which ones you have and which ones the corp owns
for my first proposal i wanted there to be a new voting option under the corporation window to split the number of existing shares for example if you propose a shares split of 31 then if it is approved everyone who currently holds shares in the company will have three times as many shares and the company as a whole will have three times as many sharesthe reason for this is that if a company wanted to do a stock split then they would have to manually send all the shares to each person in the proportional amount which can be time consumingsecond thing i wanted to propose is that if a single person or corporation owns 10 or more of another corporation then they should be able to propose votes in the corporation regardless of whether they are a member of the corporation if a single shareholder or a corporation wons more than half of the shares they should be able to implement actions that have been voted on such as ceo removaltell me what you think of my proposals and whether you see anything wrong with them

actually you could substitute good guys for police and it conveys a similar meaning but i looked up the concord assembly description and it does mention policing note it doesnt have to be a child it could a wife a father anyone you care aboutits just an analogy meant to help make the pointconcord is an independent organization founded a century ago to facilitate negotiations between the races to improve relations as well as to foster interstellar trade through policing and regulations starting as a fledgling meeting ground for diplomats concord has in the decades since it was founded slowly increased its power and influence it has become an entity independent of the races as it is able to largely fund its own operation through customs confiscation of contraband goods and other means
so combining your post before this one what exactly is it about this child bleeding to death in eve that would warrant such a change oh right theres no such thing cause its a game so its not like death is permanent here seeing as how its agamemight wanna step away from the screen once in a while and enjoy that star in our real solar system
thread locked for lack of contents
just a thought use the api and create that app yourself you might want to check the industry or the market discussion forum maybe such tool exists already
i agree
if you guys are so mad about the game so frustrated with how it doesnt let you do what you want to do sounds kinda like something a spoiled kid would say then quit eve is better off without youthat said i agree with the op that black ops should either have a bigger fuel bay or use less fuel
thanks for bringing this back on point as previous posters decided to rabble rabble over nothing in particularmuch to my bemusement
you realize eccm makes you harder to scan down right
one of the consequences of the whole plex for remaps  microtransactions blowup is that it really hammered home the need for csm to have access to the ccp backlogs just as they have access to ours this whole situation could have been avoided if csm had known what ccp wanted to do at an earlier stage we could have raised a red flag and said gee if you do this in this way you will get player ragecsm made a very forceful argument at the summit that we need backlog access and this was exhibit one in our list of reasons why
im real confused seems like you truly believe l4 income is the source of 00 issues
would be nice if you would post a link with that quote of vuk in order in what context he repliedx
for context
im just wondering how empire is being scapegoated here youre assuming the chain presumably the isk chain is warped on that end but how would you classify the risk comparison of hardcore mission farming to a similarly hardcore anomaly farm in your own spacei personally think its more dangerous to fly an efficient read as faction fit at least mission ship in empire than it is to park a carrier in an nc anomaly chain for hours on end i also would like to point out with a reasonable asessment of lpisk saturation at present anomaly income nearly doubles the rate of iskhr being generatedfurthermore nullsec is empty because of the politics of power you cannot possibly be blind to this issue sov mechanics did not make coalitions of 10k players deep nullsec stays empty because players can only be added to nullsec as space is made and offered to them by exsiting renters to not be a renter means your tcu will die horribly within days if not hoursi suppose the bottom line here is do you actually view the problems of nullsec and perhaps eve in general in this light if so can you explain why
darkness comes across as a moron and vuk gives the appearance of having some understanding of how stuff works the more isk people have the more they are willing to fight and not stress about losing ships the nc situation is because the swarms of n00bs want to have space too and there is safety in numbers most people move out of the nc once they have isk and experience but fresh n00bs are always eager to step into their shoes im talking about the avg nc member when talking about n00bs btw much of their alliance leadership has always seemed pretty solid as long as ccp actively encourages people to form 1 super gigantic blob the nc will be hard to dislodge as soon as there are strategic things that can and should be done at the small gang level the nc will suffer as their competence at the individual pilot level has consistently been pretty bad
originally by vuk lau just as a quick comment its only a myth that 00 alliances are richits easy to pontificate and throw random bull like this out there when one is easily feeding multiple accounts via alliance tax income alliance corp income renter tabs moon  etca given corp or alliance is only as rich as the greedy ers running it when it comes to nullsecpretty simple really
i think the point being made is that most alliances are not wealthy individuals in the alliances are wealthy this does not come from moon gold ive spit those numbers out multiple times in these waaaa 00 alliances are rich not fair threadsbasically it boils down like this it takes a lot of people in an alliance to hold moons it also takes a lot of infrastructure with fairly high supplymaintenance costs to maintain a presence in 00 an individual can actually make considerably more passive income running rd agents in high sec than their share of the passive income of moon gold is in a big alliance additionally an individual doesnt have fixed costs running rd agents now add to that the income from grinding on lvl 4 missions and youre talking good moneygranted an individual running plexes in 00 will make more than running lvl 4 missions but the alliance as a whole does not benefit from that other than to retain players who may or may not contribute to defense of the alliances income sources moon gold
you say that and yet its rather obvious that this is not the case else the wild and exorbatant spending of large 00 blocks would not exist i dont wonder for a second whether or not there are rich and poor members of these alliances im quite certain the broader spectrum exists but no alliance and espcially not a juggernaught coalition like the nc is making meager income the bills are paid the massive amount of infrastructure is still expanded and supercaps are still coming out like left and right and this is all prior to benefit programs which massively outspend taxation on the common corp member
it is supposed to prevent people from paying someone to grind standings for them it gives ccp a strong defense if they are sued in a rl court by a player who gets their stuff jacked after sharing their account
it might be but first i will need to check the data base and see what has been added and or catelogued already on that compelation
great idea vector would be pointing forward i hope for engine trails need the rear

whereas outposts are being deployed in such numbers that almost 1 in 5 systems in sov 00 have an outpost in themwhereas outposts are no longer a major alliance level project to deploy but are now easily within the means of any old 00 corpwhereas outposts are no longer just about economic infrastructure but are now the basis of defensive sovereigntyi propose that a method of destroying them be put in game now simply making an outpost disappear has all sorts of problematical implications so what im actually proposing is a way to wreck themthe items involved are deployable modules like sbus or tcus i propose an equivalent manufacturing cost of 500 million isk at todays material pricesto wreck a station requires that there be no sovereignty in the system and that the outpost be reduced to zero shields and armour ie an outpost that has recently been captured once deployed the module will take 12 hours to activate successfully onlining a tcu during this period will cancel the demolition timerwrecking a station has the following effects1 all station upgrades are irrevocably destroyed2 all station services are irrevocably destroyed with the sole exception that ships can be assembled but not fitted3 all market orders are immediately cancelled with the isk and items being returned to wallets and hangars respectively market taxes are not refunded items and ships in a wrecked station cannot be contracted the outpost no longer appears as a market location4 docked ships remain in player ship hangars but once undocked they cannot return5 player item hangars are accessible from space but only by their owner6 the station wreck remains in place permanently7 medical clones are immediately destroyed jump clones remain in place but can no longer be created8 the station wreck does not appear on overview as a station but as a container it is no longer a celestial objectconceptually the station wreck is essentially a giant corp hangar array that you cant put anything in to only take stuff out of freighters can collect items from station wrecksi think these conditions allow meaningful infrastructure destruction and a viable way to counter outpost spam as a defensive strategy whilst at the same time maintaining the safe haven for player assets for people who occasionally have to spend more than 12 hours away from the gamecomments and suggestions welcomed
thats a good idea supported
yeah stop the outpost spam
supporteddoes that mean you can jc into the hangar they should be destroyed also what happens to the players who were docked before the station was wrecked
support everything that supports more destruction
ty but dont forget to tick the little button thingreally it should but clones can be very significant assets eg pirate implants and the idea behind my proposal is to destroy the station not individual player assets in a way that they cant counter obviously it seems inconsistent to leave jump clones intact but the overriding principle of the outpost as a safe asset store takes precedence i feel and ccp have said they feel this way also  its a prime reason why we cant destroy outposts right now if were going to allow asset destruction then we dont need to monkey about with all the other refinements we can just go ahead and vaporise the thingedit and its not any more inconsistent than new station owners being able to remove med clones but not jump clones the principle here is the samealso im all in favour of creating gameplay situations daring highrisk operations to extract assets from a wrecked station and sneaky treacherous operations to hijack said loot seem like all kinds of awesome to megood question im going to go with nothing much  except that they suddenly have no access to station services so they cant fit or insure ships and everything on the market is suddenly unavailable being in a wrecked station is much like being in a permanently reinforced pos
excellent idea and i hope to see this implemented
cough credit coughbut im all for it
sounds to me like a proper workaround on the current problem why outposts shouldnUFFFDt be destructablefor more wrecks in space
id like to see also a proposal from now on only 1 outpost per constellation
actually im all in favour of allowing multiple outposts per system for one thing the reason so many systems have outposts is that you cant put more than 1 in a system for another conquering and with my proposal wrecking 2 outposts in one system is much easier than dealing with 2 outposts and 2 hubs and 2 tcus and 2 cyno jammer pos in 2 systemspeople want to build outposts people should be allowed to build outposts if they want to and can afford them sandbox hey but the flip side of that is that other people should be allowed to set them on fire and then gun down the inhabitants as they run out screaming
as long as either the cap on outposts per system is removed or once the outpost is destroyed another can be put in that system i am in favour of the former not the latter thoughbut excellent idea but i think the online time for the module should be longer say 24 hours
i like solves all concerns without erasing some poor sods entire possessionskeeping jumpclones seems a fair idea assuming that the destoyed station would not allow you to jump to another clone from it it gives people one chance to use their jc for a snatch and run op to get their stuff backi would suggest have the destroyed station remain a celestial object for as long as items remain within it as it creates a piece of terrain to fight overset ambushes etc once it is empty it becomes a large collidable object becoming merely an intresting bit of scenery
10
bear in mind that to capture the station the attacking alliance has already endured 4 reinforce timers of up to 3 days the defenders have had plenty of opportunity to save their station and my proposal would still give them an extra 8 hourshave mercy even invaders need to sleep eventually
this could give the art department something to do too  re design each station environment with crap thrown everywhere and everything broken downyou wis people could even later ask for a space suit that would allow you to walk in broken stations  a type of exploration maybe allowing some sort of salvage
i like
2 problems i see with the proposal as stated1 station becomes a container isnt a celestial anymore etc  sohow do people get to the station to get their stuff if destroyed are people going to be expected to bookmark all their outposts in the eventuality they get destroyed so they can retrieve their stuff from the infinity that is space also as stated it removes a decent pvpambush location to make them nolonger celestialshowever i do understand that the goal is to avoid 17 outpost wrecks in a system with a lot of turnovervalue2 ships can be accessed via ship hanger but not redocked and items are accessed from space  doesnt this seem a bit inconsistent in order to get ships you must dock but since you cant return to the station you can only do this in a pod id suggest a change to make it always be able to be docked at and treat items in the hanger like a loot can spawned from salvaging a full ship  you can tae from it but not put stuff in or you can make the station never able to be docked at ships would have to be removed via hauler or capital ship for assembled ships though youd likely have to allow contracts to take place at those wrecked stations if that was the casealso on a final note why would anyone want to destroy an outpost if there is no drawback to controlling an outpost and in order to use the outpost demolisher youd have to take the station to structure anyways then why not simply take control of the outpost who would want to spend 500m to destroy something that would make you money to keep around
because sometimes alliances just start wars to have some fights and suddenly they end up being huge spaceholders they never wanted to be also it is a nice additional option for merc contracts 
outposts are anchored at planets not in deep space even if youve forgotten at which planet the outpost was anchored it shouldnt take long to find iti dont see how the ambush potential is reduced people get ambushed at pos and indeed even at safespots and yeah we definitely dont want the overview cluttered with wrecks i dont want to propose anything that makes eves ui more difficult or cluttered i envisage the wreck working like a ship maintenence array in a pos you dont dock at smas you approach them and board a ship inside them another alternative to using a pod would be to fly a disposable ship to get to the wrecked station then transfer to your ship in the wrecki definitely dont want to see ships able to dock at wrecked stations because that cancels out half the reason for wrecking them in the first placethere are many reasons to want to wrreck an outpost 1 poorly placed outposts can be a horrible strategic liability 2 revenge roleplaying reasons or just plain spite3 sabotage  remember anyone can anchor the demolition module so it offers excellent game play opportunities for 3rd parties to mix things up imagine ransoming a station4 scorched earth  the defending alliance might want to stop a valuable staaging point falling in to hostile hands5 complacency  alliances with many many stations are incredibly dificult to invade and they have become complacent about losing a station or two to smaller alliances because they can just exhaust their opponents in to submission with reinforce timer griefing station wrecking allows smaller invaders the opportunity to do lasting damage if the defenders try to rely on this strategy6 gameplay  some people dont like the idea of 00 being literally filled with outposts and would prefer to see empty space 7 economics  if you have a station you also need to pay for a hub cyno jammer pos etc etc a station that isnt much used is an economic liability
although i am more biased towards a drop table kind of solution any option to destroy outposts is better than none
very well refuted i like your arguments and reasons and i support this nowbandwagon
definitely a step in the right direction im not very fond of the wrecking module idea though id rather see some sort of bring enough explosives fill up the station and boom  this could use a several hours long timer too operatives need time to carefully place charges at weak spots but maybe this will lead to some complete removal of wrecked outposts someday maybe they could slowly degrade and disappear after a year or so wild dreams 
the precise cinematics of how the station is destroyed arent really important  heck rather than make this a deployable module this could one day be an amazing incarna gameplay option if ccp so desired as long as the basic structure is preserved re sov requirements and timers making it a deployable sbustyle object was rather unimaginative on my part and id love to hear more interesting suggestions such as yours
taking the idea of attackable station services and really giving the idea teeth is something i do like the sound ofnot sure id go quite as far as described here though
hells yea
whereas obvious troll because anyone with internet can see there isnt even 1 outpost in every 10 systems in 00whereas this plan would make the vast majority except areas held by the same alliance for an incredibly long time complete ing wastelends because people would simply get tired of rebuilding increasing the population in empire and decreasing that in 00 furthergreat plan
some very interesting creative ideas in this proposaldeserves some consideration by ccp i think
old but awesome idea and for once very well structured i would however make it more expensive so that you elevate it to a weapon of disdain annex mass destructionjust one question what about a possible angle for rebuilding the outpost there is after all an empty hulk of transformed veldspar left in space could be a nice isk sink
coughprovidencecoughif you build it more will come if you desteroy it they will rebuildif you fought and died fro this space defending or attacking ofc youll rebuild otherwise whats the pointyep dominion was an amazing expansion
definitely in support of theseaa is on sisi right now and makes a huge differenceas a salvager more varied and accurate wrecks would be nice to interact withbattle scarring accurate weapon animations should be standardrailguns also sound weedyive had the same idea for warping around planets it seems like a pretty obvious thing to implementsuch smallish changes could really add a lot to the sci fi experience of eve
bring back the old cyno effect that is the only graphical update that is needed otherwise yeah they sound ok

eve online is a cocktail of various ships piloting specializations and choices bonuses optimizations bonuses and synergy of modules allow ships to perform specific roles to varying degrees of success do you fit for serious repair ability a large buffer or speed damage output or defense good tracking or high alpha compared to other vessels the drake is a ship of many merits which paint it as one exceptional to others lets think about the drakes various advantages for a few momentsthe drake is inexpensive and has relatively low skill requirementsthe drake uses missiles which gives it some guaranteed level of dps against any target in range heavy missile drakes can hit any target within lock range while ham drakes can strike out to maximum warp disruptor point rangeif the target is in range the missile will always hit unless the missile is outrun very few ships are capable of outrunning missiles todaypassive shield tanks and missiles give the drake nearimmunity to capacitor warfarethe drake slaughters speed shipsthe drake does not have to compromise between tank and dpsthe drakes assets are the embodiment of risk aversion it does not compromise and it does not suffer weakness the massive hitpoint buffer and modest dps lowers the drakes battlefield target priority substantially and all the while the ship can comfortably do what it does best hit hard and soak up damage like a sponge the drakes only time of weakness is when the numbers reach the critical mass to prioritize alpha strike  presuming there isnt a higher priority target on the field worse still the drake is a ship that almost anyone can fly very quickly i can think of no vessel that embodies whats wrong with eve more than this oneso how do we fix the drake the answer lies not in hurting the drakes ability to put out raw damage but in breaking the drakes ability to equip a capacitor warfare resistant tank without compromising on damage outputi propose reducing the drakes cpu output by 25 points and the grid by 75 points this will bring the drake in line with the rest of the ships in this game by forcing pilots to make a choice do you want to optimize for dps or do you want to optimize for defense you should not have the cpu and or grid to do both without compromise
show me on the killboard where the mean drake touched you
so now drake pilots will have to buy the 1 pgcpu implantyeah that will ballance itdrakes arent that great and youll hit for crap damage a mwd vagahint speed affects missile damage
the drake is fine
what you want to them to be more like gallente and less like minmatar ships
not supported for all the reasons mentioned in the original thread
now ive seen it alleveryone else complains and gripes about the drake for its insanely infamous ehp on shield tanks and yet here you are trying to buff iteither your totally out of your mind or your just that bad of a noobnot supportingps yeah your obviously a noob
you mean a not helpful bonus with a helpful oneit might screw over mission runners flying megathrons but then they will just fly a domi like everyone else
the problem i see with and mwd cap reduction bonus is that a cap stable mwd is a bigger bonus to a kiting ship than an in your face ship it also doesnt really help you maintain tank and gank without using cap boosters once youre in range with the mwd offi think that it would be more useful to get a bonus that both reduced the max cap penalty for fitting a mwd as weve already seen on a couple of ships and the mass addition penalty when you activate a mwd or ab that way you better cap regen for running gunsreps and extra cap for a couple of mwd cycles along with better speed and agility to get you into rangeas always though the main problem is still the guns
cool story broanyway ya more tech 3i would go for tech 3 bc or bs the frigate will be a welcome addition aswell even if it becomes another dramiel speed wise your just have to gimp the frigs firepower for more speed which is the beauty of tech 3
not until we see the ships we currently have being used for their intended purposes and filling those niches effectivelythere are far too many ship types assault frigates electronic attack ships black ops battleships that are either useless due to poor balancing or just being outclassed by easier to train into t1 ships i for one would like ccp to invest time on polishing the ships we already have to make them all attractive options for their costs whether that means making t2 frigates cheap to produce or buffing them changing ships niches completely or doing complete redesigns it doesnt matter as long as they all become worth training intohow many characters have you seen flying eass ive seen maybe two and i know one was doing it because he had so much money and nothing else to train into he cared about that he could afford to lose them without a second thought black ops battleships have been shown to be the least flown shiptype in eve and are hardly useful within their niche due to limitations of the hullseve has plenty of stuff already and i would like lots of useful ships at the tech 2 level over brand new shiny tech 3 ships
cool story bro
theres really no niche left for t3 shipsas said above the frigate market is saturated if t3 frigates were introduced they would replace pretty much every existing frig on the market with the possible exceptions of the rifter for cheap pvp or the kestrel for noob mission runners starting the gamet3 bcs or bss just dont seem practical the t3 cruiser can be fit to tank andor dps like a battleship in general the only weakness of the t3 cruisers is ehp andor costa t3 bc would replace the t3 cruiser in almost every area more slots more fitting more ehp slightly less maneuverable  maybe a t3 bswell what would even be the point should it tank and dps like a dread how do you keep a t3 bs from replacing marauders and faction battleships across the board unless you make it worse at specialized roles than their t1 counterparts and if that were the case who would buy themno t3 cruisers are a nice niche but eve doesnt need more this ship is better than any other comparable ships than it already has
no more t3 hulls would be a bad thing that would be stepping even further from the modular nature that t3 should bei want to see a revamp of t3 in general that would make it really modular not what we have now which is just adding more module slots to a cruiser hullas i first heard about t3 i hoped t3 to become like this and i got very disappointed about it being just another step up the ladder so change the t3 hull to a core around witch you can stick modules that make the ship a frigate a cruiser a battlecruiser or a battleship or even a hybrid how about a battleship that gets bonuses to small guns huge tracking and range bonuses and maybe a web bonus tooor a frigate that uses mediums weapons and is intended to kill cruisers that is what i always hoped t3 would be and still think it should beo
agreed
this  i have been doing this for months even dual boxing on the second montitor
makes sense
yes o
following is a compromise solution that i could live with personally  expecting that ccp will push this thru in one form or another anyway   remaps for plex get limited to twice per year this in addition to the first newbie free remap and the regular yearly remapthis would make the microtransaction more in line with a subscriptionservice fee and results in a maximum yearly subscription cost of 210 instead of 180 character transafers become also plexable 2 plexes for a character transfer  30 a slight revenue increase for ccp from the old 20 and another option for the players that have ingame currency i dont see how portrait swaps will fit into incarna so these should be removed players should be able to get surgery done in a hospital haircuts at the barber and tattoos at the tattoo parlor all player run instead of making all the fluff in incarna subject to microtransactions the fluff items should all be player run  making furniture decorating barber tattoo hospital ship paint job etc  but the corp offices and shop rentals could be paid in plex like 1 plex per 6 months which would make the maximum subscription cost 240 per year no other items would become plexableif the system was implemented as outlined above i could see myself getting subbed againif you could support this then check the box if not just reply and explain why p
supported
its not like i dont agree with your point of view but arent you assuming a lot here remaps for plex a limit might be nice but is it really necessary what i mean is that the problem with it is mainly because of the principle of the thing and your proposal doesnt change that there also arent going to be thousands of people remapping their attributes every few weeks in reality it will mostly be used by very few and they will largely stay naturally within the limitations you propose i dont like it but it wont change things in any real wayexisting character services for plexsure why not no one has been opposed to this and it would bring more income for ccp since players are much more willing speanding ig money over rl money it is just a matter of detailsprice in plex portait swapping will propably change to incarna feature player provided serviceincarna and microtransactionsthey will come in some form pure subscription models are losing in revenue earning power to hybrid models so ccp will dip its feet in to this this will happen in every major title to some extent so you will have to accept it in some form or stop playing mmos i would be disapointed beyond belief if all the fluff in incarna would be for microtransactions not even f2p microtransaction only games do that  so why dont we wait for the actual plan ccp has before jumping to conclusions usually most of the options are available through the game and just a few the bettermore interesting ones are saved for microtransactions only it might even be that you purchase a permanent licences from ccp that allows you to run a certain type of shop or facility in incarna the point is it could vary from absolutely gamebreaking to insignificant so better wait for the details
to me the limit makes sense in terms of cost and the prior reasoning behind the limit of one remap per year basically we only got 1 remap per year because our brains couldnt take the stress and the costs of doing the remaps were prohibitive now advancements have been made which make the remaps safer up to a point but the costs are still there so we capsuleers will have to pay for it if we want another remappeople who dislike remaps altogether kinda boggle me literally every game i have ever played has a form of remap for currencypersonally id rather see something a bit more complex special coupons and vouchers for each different service for example id of liked to see an attributes remap coupon arc then each coupon or voucher can be traded on the open market the market can value each service as it likes rather than ccp being the one that decides the value i have no issues with microtransactions myself my pet peeve is trading card games attached to mmos that give items you cant get any other way even if they are only fluff items one mans fluff is another mans oh god i want that

with supercaps online on the rise a new pos mod that acts as a station service structure is needed anchor inside pos right click that opens a menu like fitting service and allows station services to be carried out upgrade clones move clone apply to corps etc etc and all those other silly things you cant do in space we should not have to petition to have these things done
you dont have to petition to get these done because a petition wont do this1 clones can be made big enough to last for years way before you board the ship is spending an extra 10mil on an oversized clone really an issue when boarding a 10bn ship2 you can refit a supercap at any pos ship array or at any friendly capital ship with a ship array 3 you cant swap corps in space because it would cause all kinds of issues with standings  wardecs  etc 4 anything else can be accomplished by either using a private altcorp pos with a password only you know andor a csma to hold the ship being able to afford a 10bn isk ship implies you can afford the 100m for a towernot supported the penalty for being in such a strong ship is the need for proper planning and support
there are several threads about warp and warp animations already but stillwarp flash ftwalso the thing with changing the speed up warp we have now to a instant 100 warp has my full support warp tunnels also need rework cause it really looks stupid seeing your ship fly through planets and stations
im all for it particularly the warp tunnel tweaks to hide the oh look a planet thing
being a member of own alliance who recently have had to put up with idiotic flaming from test alliance members i was wondering if it would be possible to block an entire alliance as i feel nothing worth my time can come from testjust a suggestion

i hope you miss all the intel and get blown up by evokethis feature would be far too overpowered for when our 200 man fleets convospam the one red who didnt get the memo that his station was getting reinforced
at least we dont endorse awoxing bluesto stay on topic though a mass ignore option would actually be kinda nice if possible
i did you the favor of informing test of your desire
exactly op please use whats already offered to you
there is its called being in the same corporation and exercising restraint in not killing your training pilot and vice versaits not that hard to figure outwhy make this so complicated ccp has enough crap to fix
apologies for the derail rulelike i said before having flown in black ops fleets quite a bit lately the size of the fuel bay is the only issue i think needs attention
edited due to inaccuracy
which is what i said originally before thread took uturn into stupid land but its all goodhires faces and sansha pve is the priority yeahyummyeat it and smileoh rockets too forgot that
i posted summaries of day 1 and day 2 day 3 summary coming soonwas a short day for me due to flight schedules so maybe another csm will chime in about it with some brief insightsdont forget we are going to be publishing minutes with more detail as soon as they can be written and edited but wanted to get some information out to the community asap so you had an idea of what went on
there are alliances and there are powerblocks who are organisations of alliances in flexible but hierarchically structured collaboration theres many things you can say about them but one thing is pretty simplealliances in 00 are rich unless their leaders are rich go over eves history you will find a few examples where there were exceptions mostly tied to times of great investment or attrition or times of great stupidity but overall youll find it holds truealways ask the question from what point of interests a statement or even an opinion comes place it also in that context
which brings me back to the original question why is he bringing up highsec income00 income needs nerfing therefor everything else must be scaled back with it or is there something else im not reading between the lines
ah ok thats what i needed to hear that is an actual reason im cool now 
still need fixing
haters gonna hate

got my support say no to stationshooting online
nice idea malc big thumbs up from me like the idea of it being tied to incarna and saboteurs too
i dont like the idea of destroying a station just by pressing a button but i do like this idea i would like it to be more of a death star type thing you build a death star and its a one shot deal it travels to its target system slowly and then takes a few days to power up its main gun and then wrecks the station should be a way to cause some more fights as wellit could even be the basis for a new expansion an expansion based on a giant death sphere that wrecks stations is about 100x more interesting then some more sansha rats
what part of the following did you not understandcautious support if implemented the rate of destruction and consequences should be analyzed for impact on 00 population drop the destruction requirements should then be rebalanced
530 outposts 3000 sov 00 systemsoutposts cost less than an aeon at market prices these days
oh yes a ship that flies something like a freighter huge and slow you fly it to a station and activate destruct mode like a 10 minute seige timer or something replace the 12 hour wait with a slow vulnerable ship that has to be physically moved in to place nice thats much better than a boring anchorable module
thumbs upi think the wrecking module should be more expensive costly enough that people will mostly only use it if they have a strategic reason rather than for lulz
aeons at market value are over double what they cost to build because people are stupid anyone paying 20b for a supercarrier is getting swindled i also notice you fail to provide a link or source of data for your outposts to system ratio you simply provide a number that is mysteriously the exact ratio you suggested earlier
you mean like how when titans were originally introduced they were designed to be so expensive that theyd be a rare sight and surely no alliance would be able to afford more than 1 or 2 of themcost based restrictions never work in eve at all ever attemping to introduce one will simply give the rich superpowers another tool which they can wave around when they need to keep smaller alliances in line
supporting the principle as it would introduce a new mineral sinkmake it a capital only module dreadnaught
that list seems to count conquerable stations which were spawned from day one of eve not just playerconstructed outposts
4256 supportedi want to be mesmerized by visuals when i kill people or get killedalso i want some kinda death animation when i die so i can watch myself blowup in some glorious ball of fire and then see my pod shooting out of the explosion in a random direction
if what you say is true i would be very glad we will seedo you have a weblink to that eurogamer thing thx
on the fence whether ccp should remove learning skills or not but i would accept this as an alternative to them if i had to chooseps i do have many many skill points into learning all basic to 5 and all adv to 4 you wont beleive how long this took to get it was almost as bad as training for hulk i feel that i wasted too much time in learning skills yet i do feel that hopefully it will pay off
this would help new players out when people tell them train learning skills for your first month and a half they usually quit or dont do it lol
as a new player who took the time to get almost all the learning skills to 5 i dont think theres anything wrong with them they dont need to be fixed that said if ccp does decide to remove them this idea is better than the others ive seen
i am davelantor and i approve of this messagethis is something of a hot patch thing  can be very easily implementedbut with the new system to have free sp to distribute around etc  this can even be more easily implementedjust delete all the learning skills and give the player the attributes but also give them the sp spentthat way everybody is happy 
no everyone would not be happy ccp are aware that removing learning skills would anger alot of people i did suggest that it would anger the least amount of people if the learning skills were given away
back to the top
im in
wtfman you guys are greedy take what ccp offers and be happy with it dont beg its not becoming for anyonei would be happy with a lump of coal from ccp tbh oh wait they already gave me that the new optional patches silly me p
the problem is ccp  logo nzisthe current restirctions for an alliance logo is1 3 months since formation2 apropriate3 sized righteven when they follow those rules some people still have a problem getting ccp to approve thier logos it would be cool which is why i support it but not probable from later posti support this addition it nullifies my problem with the idea
my only problem with this is corporations come and go so fast that i can see cases where the corp that submitted the logo is folded by the time it actually makes it into the game not only being likely but commonno sorry i cant support this despite yeah thatd be cool attraction
the requirement to ship logos with a patch is a stupid requirement on ccps side you dont have to wait for a patch until you see new characters portraits they have a backend that serves them on demand even on the internet side while submitted corp logos still need to undergo verification and approval by a ccp employee technically that should be very doablesupported
did you not read what evelgrivion said or did you just drink a gallon of bleach and figure it would be a good time to post something go back and read his post and youd see hes calling for a nerf not a buff of the drake
a t2 drake can just about hold its own against a t1 meta 4 hurricane hurricane has less tank more gank drake has more tank less ganki think it could use a little buff in damage tbh but im willing to accept my low dps for my turtletanknot supported unless you give us damage buffs
1 the drake is within a few mil of any t2 bc in terms of hull and full fit cost with insurance2 missiles are op now get the  out3 see above4 passive shield tanks ie resist amps and 23 lse on drakes  no tackleno prop mod if you think that still leaves them dangerous urbad5 the drake slaughters speed ships that dont know how to degress andor pick appropriate targets6 the drake does have to compromise between tank and tackle which matters outside of a giant blob but youre right no other ship in the game is dangerous in large numbers in conclusion htfu
i do not supportwhy blaster ship problems should be fixed through some perverted way the problem of blaster ships is the weapon missiles were revised not rockets lasers were revised projectiles were revised  it is time to balance hybrid weaponlast projectile boost was pretty smart and finetuned apocripha tc and te gave falloff boost dominion gave latent dps boost through ammo
just please dont destroy myrmidon i dont care about the hyperio but hands off ma myrmidongive that boost to deimos and brutix maybe in megathron too also dominix is fine with the bonus on reps
nerf the hell out of t3 cruisersmake t3 frigs bcs ectonly way it would be possible
supporting more t3 doesnt have to be ships
like modular modules
we could have t3 launchers guns shield boosters etc
ccp mentioned those on fanfest 2009 already though nothing specific
if the t3 concept is expanded it would be much preferable to see t3 modules with a similar sort of modularcustomisation theme to them although how that would be implemented is another matter
i approve and endorse this proposal further and im all ears if theres a fix to this why when using a second monitor can i only go full screen on whichever monitor is designated as primary it makes navigating my computer crazydifficult
you are doing it wrongi run 2 accounts on my 2 monitors both are fullscreen via evemon see the relocator tab next to tools use it
when i select the journal i would like to see a tab that check marks missions with all completed objectives that are ready to be turned in instead of having to click on read more and scrolling down
sounds reasonable and very handy supported
i likemicrotransactions dont give you an advantage even plex for remaps though i like the qqs of people thoughchar transfers are good too that makes it easy to trade between 2 of my accountsno in game item should be only created by rl money other then the plex and plexs should always be trabable
my dad and i are relatively new at this game but im pretty sure what happened to him should not have so i thought i would ask about my dad was finishing up a mission and it required him to go pick up some slaves and then bring them back to the agent and on his way back minmatar customs stopped him they asked him to give up the slaves but thinking that it was his mission to get them to the agent he refused and well you know the rest should he have given them up to customs any helpadvice would be muchly appreciated
your dad received a message when he looted the slaves saying that it is an illegal item therefore the minnie customs did their jobkeep an eye for items with a skull on their icon and dont loot themthe customs scan random players on gate  chances to get caught are random  but either your father looted the wrong item for the mission or it was a really crappy mission ps you post it on the wrong place there is a nice subforum called missions and complexes here we post suggestionstrollsissues etc
if it is reallythe the item you have tog et the the mission i find that very dumb the mission neds to be moved o amarr or other slaeallowing pace
some missions have mission specific items which need to be obtained from a location which should be highlighted in your mission brief there are other similar items that can be dropped by structures now in your case i dont know if this is the case but my guess would be that customs scanned your ship and notified you that an item you were carrying was contraband this more than likely wasnt the item in your mission brief perhaps a forum mod could move this topic to missions and complexes
it would also help if you could give us the name of the mission being run
the mission was called a terrible thing and the agent was odingill reiradur in vullat but anyways he put up a petition and they told him they dont know what happened either they put the slaves in the station and said they would investigate it the mission called for him to bring back some breeder slaves but he also had some regular slaves on him so im thinking that may have been the issue sorry this was posted in the wrong forum
would be stupid not to
the old one gave you a good insight into what the  happened in eve thenew one gives you a good guideline give ald one some eyecandy and plug it back in or make a hybrid of the twp
id really like to see a small addition to the hud in the same area as ship speed or the various health meeters for cargo capacity its frustrating to keep the cargo window open just so i can see my current fill limiti realize this issue is compounded by certain advanced ships with specialized cargo areas like the rorqual or orca
since you hae to have the cargo window open to drag stuff into it which is really the only time this matters can you perhaps expand on why we need this changed aside from it annoys me
good idea
i am davelantor and i approve this messageawesome idea d
yes but the point of iseen is valid and should be taken into account

corp cynos are a popular thing and very useful when employed as a method to give greater mobility to corps they are also against the eula this csm issue is to figure out some way to make accounts that can be accepted as legitimate corp cyno accounts and make the gms happy but also let the players do what they were doing anyways except above the table nowrequirements  the account has to be only paid for with a plex with no tie to personal information only directorsceo have access to the accounts only directors and ceo can create the accountsaccount info can not be changed through account management page or if it is only the original details are referencedalso any hacked account petitions are totally ignored by default  the gms can sort out the rest
sounds greatwould be nice for titans as well because i know people share titan chars all the timealso instead of only directors and ceos being able to use the accounts make a new role that allows the account to be used by only people who have the required role
so if the account actually gets hacked you should just say bye bye to the char and the game time still left on the accountnot supporting because we dont need more disposable chars once you do have such accounts shared by many hard accountability is gone opening a can of wormsps posting in a pl confession thread
alternately make friends with people who have cyno alts ensure your blackops fleet leaders know which alliance members can light covert cyno keep outofband contact details eg msn mobile phone email address so you can contact covert cyno folks to help out in times of urgencyits an mmo game try to make friends before you try to make friendsps the way to address a shortage of supercapital ships compared to the number of pilots you have who can fly them is to look for ways to securely store your supercaps not share supercap pilot accounts
sounds like an extremely good proposal to me it would be interesting if maybe not as an account but you train a skill that allows you to jump into a corp asset clone that is able to do this very task would save alot of administration at ccps end it could be a single use item for xyz isk or mulitple use perhaps a microtransaction if that all goes aheadsupported
as much as i hate it this post is exactly the problem accountability for actions
account sharing is against the eula and the tos for a reason  it gives ccp someone concrete to point the finger at if something actually illegal as in rl illegal should crop upno not supported and if you think ccp is going to give up their legal get out of jail free card youre insane
i would like to see an additional time display above the current gmt time display on the bottom left hand cornerit would display local time and be labled as such if possible i would also like to add an alarm clock feature or timer feature to this so i know when i have to actually stop playing thank you for reading this dev team
me like support request approved
i think maybe the reason it isnt getting the attention is because they are still perfectly useable ships with things the way they are yes having to have a hauler for fuel is annoying and ideally wouldnt be necessary but can be worked around fairly easily in our black ops fleets we usually have one of the scouts dual box the hauler
is there any other ship in game where this is a requirementnocarriersdreadsmomstitansjfssorrydont see them requiring a fuel haulersuch a simple fix to make the bobs do not need buffing or improving beyond this to make them properly balanced and in line with other nongate users
black ops ships are not the same as other jump capable ships but if you wish to use that line of arguementcan any other ship in the game bridge shipsjump into a cynojammed systemnocan any other ship in game with a jump bridge also use gates to get into a staging systemnoas things stand you have enough range and fuel capacity to bridge a significant number of ships into a system and the ability to use gates to get into a staging system if you need to bridge more ships you either use a fuel barge or you use a second black ops i agree it would be nice to be able to carry more fuel but since the original complaint the fuel capacity was greatly improved and i see people using them every day
bleah for spinning poorly seriously dude oh yes i forget that bobs can use conventional gates what an exciting and innovative feature that isyour spin and misdirection is disappointing i expected bettersilly me
he explained pretty clearly why black ops are a unique type of ship and why their current profile still allows them to be useful
yes im pretty sure everyone knows that whats your point
you seem to misinterpret the scanners signiture strength now comes into effectthe amount of programing would be fair but not massive since the scannys sensor strength is already taken into account to set up the signal strengths when you scan put in a gate that says any cloaked ships below your ships sensor strength show up too you wouldnt be able to tell a cloaked signature from a regular one eitheras for the rest of the comments thank you for your input i like the one where you are removed from local but i would only have that for covops cloakslet the flaming trolls continueari kelor
i really enjoy reading these reports after each summitit gives a much more positive picture of what is actually going on behind the scenes at ccpcant wait for the day 3 reports
whats confusing you 00 alliances are not all fabulously wealthy indeed many simply cannot afford the bills to claim many systems at all and struggle to pay for what they do hold more to the point the costs of paying for sov an extensive pos network stations etc is very very expensive to say nothing of the capital and supercapital fleets that need to be churned out to hold let alone take ground added to that is the fact that much of the isk in the major alliances is concentrated in those subgroups that bring in heavy income xt corp in rzr for instance is richer than many alliances in the game due to their industrialism most individual pilots in 00 however are not overly wealthy losing a battleship hac and a recon or whatever may be cause for days of rattingplexinganomalies just to get back to even contrast that with the incredibly lowrisk ability to grind massive amounts of isk faction standing and loyalty points in highsec l4s will never be nerfed just not going to happen so instead finding ways to make entering into 00 easier is one proposed solution finding a sov system that does what dominion was supposed to do rather than sov structures that you need a massive fleet to down well thatd be a start but vuk is essentially correct also he should give me isk
fair points but the confusion is where the exchange is between 00 and empire mission runners i dont consider the bears in empire to be the cause of much of anything aside from cheap faction gear i buy from them out in the void frankly i find anomalies outpace what the most impressive empire bears can boast and i dont even use a carrier for themalso youre quick to point out the amount of isk going into sov upkeep poss and supercaps and yet fabulous numbers of all these things are going up around the universe still even realtive unknown corps are now the prowd owners of a few supercarriers from the sound of his post it seemed as though the correlation was isk faucets in highsec are essentially the funding for supergrowth in nullsec i just dont see the link though the isk flow seems to be inward to empire and not the other way around therefor my theory has been that nullsec is much more lucrative than ever before
you cant lower anyones income and expect them to welcome it boosting income is the what catches players attention if you want to get someone to go somewhere make it worth their while
page 6 is unacceptable
i would say i have to agree what the gankers are doing is a crime and should not be supported by insurance i also feel it is wrong for them to ruin the game for those that enjoy high sec missioning they should not be able to destroy something someone spent months earning i have no issue if it was a consensual fight but they shouldnt be able to destroy your hard work in high sec space if you didnt want to enter a fight
no
no
the point in flying a ship in this fashion is that it improves the ability to make kills vs people that dont want to fight you or people that have a fair chance of gtfo so it requires a ship that gets the kills done while relaying on as less mistakes of the other pilot as possiblealso it did highly improve the ability shut down sub bs tacklers quick and makes you easy to catch but hard to holdat least pre qr it didin my general experience a heavy tank is not this important for a predator i use even less ehp in my current bs fits with multiple fights ending in structure i still not feel the need for a better tanking ability since it would be a wast of slots most of the time
supported but only if the strippers are missing teeth sport blindingly low iqs and have stretch marks realism right
i propose that electronic attack ships are reviewed and hopefully rebalanced to make them a more viable choice in their current state they dont perform really well and it may not be a surprise to know that according to the 2010 q1 economic report there are currently more super carriers actively being flown than there are electronic attack ships i think this speaks volumes about the their current iterationtldr why do electronic attack ships suck in a nutshell huge signature radius combined with worse than stealth bomber ehp and almost as bad agility several of the bonuses feel weak and out of place and in the keres case its role overlaps pretty heavily with interceptorsi will list here what i think needs to be reviewedchanged as well as my own personal experience with each ship and the problems with each one ability to evade damage versus effective hit pointsi think this is the first and most important thing that needs to be reviewed currently electronic attack ships have the biggest signature radius for all frigates around about 40 more signature than the average frigate for this class they also have fairly bad agility and engagement ranges which put them in the line of fire for close range medium weapons unlike interceptors they also get tracked while mwding in their engagement ranges fitting a plate or shield extender to these ships which many consider mandatory further emphasises this problem personally i feel like their signature radius should be tuned down to around about the racial stealth bomber values the agility on them could also do with tweaking a bitkeresok this one is probably in the worst shape out of all the eas it has 2 cap bonuses and yet still cant run a mwd and tech ii disruptor at the same time let alone if you want to run dampeners on it its main problem though is that is overlaps incredibly severely with the tackler interceptors 30km versus 36km points combine that with many of the interceptors strengths such as being much more cap stable higher ehp faster more agile signature radius while mwding is only slightly bigger than the keres base signature radius really there is almost no reason to ever fly a keres when you can fly the ares i propose increasing the base capacitor stats while replacing the cap related bonuses with more useful bonuses related to the keres survivability it needs to somehow stand out and be a viable alternative to the tackle interceptors personally i feel making the keres a bit more combat orientated will do this such as giving it increased drone bandwidth and drone bay and swapping out the cap bonuses for turret damage related bonuseshyenai dont think this one is that bad although i must say that 20km engagement range at eas5 is a little short for my liking it also has some fairly bad bonuses 3 to signature radius reduction per level being probably the worst bonus on any frigate id recommend buffing the stasis webifier range bonus from 20 to 30 thatll give it 25km at eas5 which seems a lot more reasonable to me ill also suggest the same as what i suggested with the keres and make it hit a little harder a small drone bay 10m3 and some turret bonuses would help it out quite a bit i think increase the base capacitor stats a little to account for the mwd cap bonus being replacedkitsuneno real individual complaints here over than what has been said that applies to all eas my only pet peeve with this ship is that it gets a optimal range bonus to ecm while having a horrible lock range id recommend buffing the base capicitor by 25 and replacing the 5 to cap amount with 75 to lock range per level
sentinelis currently the best and probably the only eaf which is currently flyable i wouldnt recommend tweaking it too much but it could do with getting the cap recharge bonus built in and given a drone hitpoint bonus or something similarim not a game designer the changes and values ive suggested are mostly placeholders for the proposal just to give it a little more direction and so it doesnt get rejected for not having a clear proposal so please dont berate this proposal if you dont agree with me on a changesnumbers levelanother suggestion which props up quite a bit is allowing them to use the blackops jump bridge which i think is a good idea and meshes well with their theme of being decentralised electronic warfare tldr buff agility and signature radius rework weak ship bonuses maybe allow them to use black ops jump bridges
yea it does but there are only like 50 something conquerable stations for example 8 of its 67 are conquerable stationsnot that it matters they can abide by the same rules as outposts imo
why should these be treated differently
supported though i have a few gripes with the proposal 1 if the station wrecks are permanent fixtures wouldnt we just end up cluttering space with station wrecks instead surely a rebuilding mechanism is sensible 2 i am not sure i understand the mechanic you propose for accessing items in a wrecked station is the idea that anyone now has access to everything in terms for ships andor items in that station if that is the case the load this would place on the server is completely unjustifiable
they probably shouldnt but you included their numbers in your op when talking about the amount of outpost systems and rate at which new outposts were being built which distorts the actual figures somewhat
at the current rate of outpost creation a few dozen conquerables are barely a couple of months worth of building  30 outposts have been built in the last 35 days and as it is player built outposts outnumber them 101when new outposts are being created at the rate of almost 1 per day then we have to consider that theyre no longer special enough to be immune from destruction
balancing game mechanics purely by cost is seldom a good idea id suggest making it of negligible cost but tricky to deploy freighter requiredi think a 24hr timer would be necessary as any significant changes to outposts would probably need to be done over downtime as with outpost deploymenthow would this work if all the offices were occupied and removing the upgrades reduced the number of officespresumably rd jobs in progress at the outpost would be cancelled what about jobs taking place at starbases elsewhere in the system with the bpo in the outpostalso re medical clones the default location should transfer back to corp hq which is always a station in empirei think making the transition outpost  nonoutpost with the remaining conditions you suggest would be quite a lot of work to implement i think there are 2 other options which would work better1 leave an intact outpost in a permanently crippled state with all services disabled all corp assets irrevocably impounded and all docking rights revoked the owner of the outpost should have the option to rebuild it by deploying a similar device in a similar way costing maybe half what an outpost costs to build2 remove the outpost entirely along with everything items clones and all inside it at the time of destruction i think this is the better option
holy f someone else in this world that knows how to make a motion based on roberts rules of order marry me other than that supportedbut i seriously hope ccp gives it a much cooler nameedit stupid support button
great idea
this is very similar to the pillage idea ive heard about outposts i agree with the general concept except that i disagree with destroying medical clones i think that can create a lot of problems for people i also think its not necessary if you keep jump clones alive anyway why not med clones too considering people wont be able to resupply fit ships bring in new stuff etc people wont want to keep their med clone in a destroyed station anyway im also not sure about treating it as a big corp hangar array as it would suddenly leave a lot of peoples personal items vulnerable for theft who has access to the container contents etci have one suggestion allow people to rebuild the outpost in the same way you build one in the first place the outpost is wrecked but you can put raw materials into it like you put in an outpost egg once youve filled it up the outpost can be repairedrebuilt and once again open for business this should be a significant cost of course  but not quite as much as a new outpost allowing this mechanic also justifies keeping peoples stuff trapped in a destroyed outpost want your crap back rebuild the outpost this should require sov in the system obviously
thanks for the pics ive never seen the originals but they are beautifull i want those backits not fair that my dramiels current engine trail is only slightly longer than the ship i want one thats at least 3 times as long and 5 times when i hit my afterburner or mwd and go zooooooom
eurogamer the same reader asked when engine trails are coming back  pleasetorfi frans olafsson hopefully next release we are talking to the graphics programmers about it but first we will be introducing turret graphics on all the shipssorry to dash your hopes but these new turret effects are not even on sisi yet and incursion testing is well underway
good solution that gives new players more time to try out other things like ship racesindustry over boring training time
i propose that the ability to neut a triagedsieged ship be removed the reason is pretty straight forward neuts are a form of ew you cannot remote sensor boost a sieged ship but on the flip side you cant sensor damp one either the same applies for tds vs remote tes ecm vs remote eccm and so on the one exception to this is cap transfer vs neuting you can neut them but you cant cap transfer i believe cap transferring while sieged would be overpowered so im proposing the ability to neut be removed instead
and how will you beat triagedsieged caps without cap warfare pure dps
yes while in siegetriage you cant be rrd so youre left with only what you can self tank in even the smallest capital fights coming up with 1015k dps to break even the toughest triaged carriers isnt an issue the fair alternative as i previously stated is allowing cap transfers while siegedtriaged but that would add more capability to them than what i proposed
no capacitor warfare is not the same at all as electronic warfare not supported
drake is fine its solid in pve and pvp not overpowered though it has its weaknesses
edited for mistakeshe is right between tank and dps but as a solo persondps  tank with no gank  badtank  gank with no dps  baddps  gank with no tank  maybe but still not goodso guess what you are gonna be in fleet or you will sack somethingin other words its fine

eve online is a cocktail of various ships piloting specializations and choices bonuses optimizations bonuses and synergy of modules allow ships to perform specific roles to varying degrees of success do you fit for serious repair ability a large buffer or speed damage output or defense good tracking or high alpha compared to other vessels the hurricane is a ship of many merits which paint it as one exceptional to others lets think about the hurricanes various advantages for a few moments  the hurricane is inexpensive and has relatively low skill requirements  the hurricane uses autocannons which gives it enormous flexibility in engagement range good tracking and damage type selection as well as being able to comfortably fit the highest caliber guns  if the target has low transversal the autocannons will always hit for respectable dps  the ability to match the mobility of a cruiser gives it the ability to disengage from a fight easily  the hurricane slaughters all sorts  the hurricane does not have to compromise between utility and dpsthe hurricanes assets are the embodiment of risk aversion it does not compromise and it does not suffer weakness the reasonable hitpoint buffer and excellent mobility firepower and neuts allow it to disengage at will the hurricanes only time of weakness is when the numbers reach the critical mass to prioritize alpha strike or when powerful neuting is brought to bear  presuming a curse or battleship is available worse still the hurricane is a ship that almost anyone can fly very quickly i can think of no vessel that embodies whats wrong with eve more than this oneso how do we fix the hurricane the answer lies not in hurting the hurricanes ability to put out raw damage but in breaking the hurricanes ability to equip every mod it needs without compromising on firepower or mobilityi propose reducing the hurricanes cpu output by 50 points and the grid by 150 points this will bring the hurricane in line with the rest of the ships in this game by forcing pilots to make a choice do you want to optimize for utility or do you want to optimize for dps you should not have the cpu and or grid to fit a full rack of 425mm autocannons with a large shield buffer and 2x medium neuts or medium neut and warfare linksee what i did there
youre right nerf the drake buff the hurricane
fine then its a nerfhow about less bull and more directeitehr way the drakes fine just look at what everyone else is saying about ityou also should keep in mind the cladari dont really have much to say when it comes to pvp ships as it isim content to let them have their drakes  o pthe op is still a noob imho for even bothering to ask for a nerfbuff or whatever the hell hes asking for
okay not to be a jackass but there are 3 things wrong with this statement 1stthe deimos already has this boost but is still mostly a fail ship 2ndthe megathron has no boost to armor repping 3rdnor does the domi but while were on the subject an armor repping bonus on the domi would make quite a few people happy as for the op the deimos already has this boost but its still a laughing stock of killboards so id have to say its more of a gun problemnot supported 
drugs are good mkay a booster revamp proposalcurrent situationcombat boosters exist in eve however their usage is limited and with a very low usage also comes very low market activity and limited production activity kspace gas cloud products raw materials for boosters are nearly worthless and all products involved with booster production have a very low trade volume this is aggravated by the fact that many alliances do their booster production inhousea big reason they are not used much is because of their side effects ignoring synth boosters that give only a small benefit and are ignored by a lot of people because of it for most players the chance of having your play time messed up by unfortunate side effects outweighs the benefit of greatly increasing one stat this means combat booster usage is mostly restricted to specialised pilots in specific situations i am quite fond of boosters and the edgy dystopian image they represent i think they fit eve perfectly and would like to see them used more this proposal suggests a solution that aims to increase booster usage and with it booster production solutionthe solution is split into a core component as well as several optional suggestions while i think they all complement eachother the optional suggestions are not strictly necessary for the idea to workrevamped booster mechanics corethe core of this solution is a change to the way booster penalties are applied currently theres a chance for any of four penalties to be applied for the duration of your booster this means that if youre very unlucky the penalties undo the beneficial effect of the boosterinstead i propose to delay the penalties until after the booster and its beneficial effect wears off  similar to the come down experienced after using real life drugs the benefit is that someone can be certain of beneficial effects when they take their booster they also know that when the booster wears off they will suffer the penalties but you can plan for that maybe you log off maybe your op only lasts an hour anyway or maybe you take another booster when you take a booster any negative effects from previous boosters are removed however once this second booster wears off the negative effects will return worse with a longer duration and possibly also higher intensity it is like going on a really long cokextc binge the eventual crash will be much worse than if you only take one line of cokepillthis mechanic will encourage the casual use of boosters as you are guaranteed a strong positive effect for the duration of the booster without any penalties until the booster wears off this mechanic will also mean some pilots may develop actual addictions where the total penalties of their repeated booster use have become so great they have to keep taking boosters or accept a very long detox time this also allows for the development of a special detox booster that does not offer any stat boost but only decreases the intensity or duration of the negative effects like methadon for a her0in addict
low sec is booster central optionalas the slums of empire space i think low sec is has the perfect profile to match drug manufacturing this can be encouraged by seeding certain booster raw materials only in low sec this would most likely require some more components to be needed for booster production additionally booster bpcs should become more available through low sec exploration sites to allow for more trade and to handle the increased demand again low sec is a great place for thatadditionally allow booster production in 04 space the current restriction on 03 or lower seems to have no good justification as 04 space is not any less dangerous than 03more boosters optionalto further promote the use of boosters more boosters could be made available as mentioned above a detox booster could be made there could be ewar related boosters energy warfare and tackling related boosters there could be boosters to increase cyno jump range mining yield and invention success rate you could also add a tier of boosters between synth and standard still illegal but not as expensive and not quite as strong as standard boosters all of this would be player produced and player marketed the possibilities are endlesspros and conspro more booster trading means drug manufacturingsmuggling can be a real profession more variation in ship abilities through boosterimproved setupscon boosters may become standard for pvp similar to rigs players may need to be drugged up to compete
i like boosters and i really think they should have a wider market than they do today i support you 
dont forget to support yourselfi like the idea although i think it would be good to have some antilogofski mechanic maybe logging should only remove part of the comedown so that you will always have a hangover the next time you log on this will be countered by docking up and cloaks but at least it will give people a reason to stay logged on and not take the tooeasy way out
this was an idea that you described in the low sec focus group i conducted during my csm campaign it was well received by the group then and sounds even better with this excellent description i for one think that the low sec option could be a pivotal element in an overall revamp or makeover of low sec providing a very good incentive to making low sec mattervery much supported when this gets raised in csm it will have my enthusiastic vote of support
supported
never used boosters myself but this sounds like a good changesupported
oh my gosh i think you found the holy handgrenade of antioch if what you proposed were in place i would actually use themsweet
nice idea supported
drugs jajaja 3
if all the cool kids are doing it
not supportedhaving used boosters plenty of times i find the mechanics to be rather well balanced as is if side effects were delayed it would be way too overpowered you pop your booster winsurvive your fight and then dock up when the side effects kick in side effects would never have an impact boosters then become an i win button for those that can afford them with production limited to lownull and the dramatically overpowered benefit they would give one could even say mandatory to stay competitive in pvp it would be a sellers market and price would remain high or even increase sorry but your proposal displays a rather naive interpretation of gamer mentality and a serious lack of game balanceby the way there are skills which reduce both the chance and amount of side effect once trained you will very rarely get all 4 side effects and occasionally i have had no side effects at all randomness is goodhowever i do agree that making ladar sites more available in lowsec would be a plus but only a minor one widespread gas harvesting in lowsec is about as likely as mining in lowsec not gonna happen harvesting will stay in null where space is somewhat more controllable and far safer than lowsec as a result boosters will continue to be primarily done for inhouse nullsec use and will stay low volume on the open market doesnt matter where you seed the bpcs the ability to safely obtain the base material is the clincher its exactly like mining imagine if you could only pull veld from low or nulli like the idea of making boosters more commonly used but your idea needs more work
i know theres skills i have neurotoxin recovery iv and nanite control iv the goal of this proposal is to take combat boosters out of obscurity and into mainstream and that means making them or their use more popular which means more people will produce them and more people will look for its resources low sec gas cloud mining never has to be huge you dont need that much gas cloud materials for a batch of boosters but as it is kspace gas clouds are completely worthlessas for not suffering any side effects in this system  a side effect could be slower learning or it could last a lot longer i didnt mention specific details like that because balancing that is the job of ccps game designers if you feel combat boosters should remain a rarity in eve then fine but i think it would be a lot more interesting if many more players used them similarly to what happened with rigs
great idea drug addicted pilots ingame played by eve addicted players i love it
as much as i very like the basis of diedras idea these issues are going to have to be addressed or it would create the exact opposite spectrum issue
indeed that is exactly what i believe i think i stated that pretty clearly in the last sentence of my previous post sarcasm the current side effects are not the issue with boosters the issue is the cost most people find it hard to justify 10mil for a oneshot strong booster that will only last half an hour and the cost comes from the availability of the base materials and the skills to some degree you make an excellent comparison with rigs people didnt use rigs because it was hard to justify spending 10mil on a rig for a frigate price dropped and now people rig frigsmake the gas more available and price will drop and the only way you are going to be able to do that is to put gas pockets in hisec not talking about the synth crap downside is that it could possibly destroy the nullsec booster industry

i think that it would be a very good thing to change the bonuses on fleet command ships and t3 to affect all link types that would make it possible to mix all the different types of links with each other which would boost the abilities of those ships greatly it also would get the the eos out if its information warfare link hole that could never be filled by bufing them anywaycrazy o
i would like to suggest that for every successful series of invention runs on a particular bpo the player should get a small incremental improvement of odds for the next run this can be capped at a certain point so there is always chance of invention failure for example every 10 successful invention runs could improve the chance of inventing on the original bpo by say 1 on the 11th run the next 10 by another 1 to a maximum bonus of 5 after 50 runs figures chosen purely to illustratei think the logic that the character never remembers or benefits from a succesful run is flawed particularly if the character is inventing repeat items of the same t2 typeapologies if this has been raised before
so after a while you would have 100 chance so the market gets flooded even morenot really supported
im not suggesting a 100 invention success rate rather an improved chance of future success for those regular multiple t2 invention runs such as ammo drones etc gained through successful experience as stated i think the logic of never learning from invention trial and error is flawed
hmmminvention  bpo  invention  bpo something does not quiet fit here  if i only knew what it is oh yeah its just a dumb idea
not dumb supported on basis not extended to things larger than drones or ammo

edited for clairitywe need a new type of agent that operates in all secthat trains piolts to play together as a teamyou mean like faction warfare it kinda does that or atleast that was my impression of itif you did then then fleets of alts would be the only ones doing it cause it would be too much of a pain and what if people dropped out of fleet then what what would happen if you abandon the wreaks i am afraid this leaves too many holesthis i doubt it is not just about teamwork but about numbers and timing having enough people on at the same or sometimes all times of the dayyou just described sleepers and wh space why not try bringing your group there good rewards and a chance to work on teamworkthe high end loot is for null  low sec if we start adding it to mission rewards everywhere it devalues lawless space bad idea and also of note pve is not gonna really help you with pvp the two critters are very very differentyou do have a point though it is difficult to teach people to work as a team but i think this is best done by players and not implemented by the devs in a universe  war ground like ours that keeps changing every moment of the day it is best that players teach players there are several institutions corporations and alliances that are designed to do this and faction war is already part of the game to give you opportunities to try as welli can appreciate your frustration as it is similar to my frustration as well but i dont think this is the right avenue for fixing it
yes the bomb needs visual love even if ccp would just paste the shock wave ring from a pos explosion onto the bomb effect after being resized to fiti would prefer two shock rings at 90 degrees to each other both of which reach 15km from center before fading

even better  have the ship issue a recall drones order on disconnect before initiating emergency warp whether the drones make it into the drone bay or not before the ship enters emergency warp its up to player drone navigation skills drone type small drones travel faster navigaton skills shiptype and momentum and of course range of drones from the ship when receiving the return to dronebay order should be simple to implement
the journal used to do this such missions would be listed as completed instead of accepted or offeredi dont know why it changed
yeah i would like that
limits make sense in terms of backstory but not like what ccp is going to do it doesnt make sense since you cant buy your way out of the limitation with isk the in game currency it wont make sense since the only item you can use for the service is created outside the game for rl cash the service provider wont do it for a titan worth tens of billions but will do it for nonsensical metagame item that has only a fraction of the value of a titan it just doesnt make any senseattribute remaps i can see happening and unsurprisingly it did but not skill remaps eve isnt like every other game and the players chose this game for presicely that reason it was one of the only games that had meaningful choices hard to reach long term goals and didnt cater to the i want it all now crowd trying to turn it in to the opposite of what it started of as will cause serious issues with the existing playerbase for benefits that might never materialize for ccp basicly they kill off the longetivity of the game in exchange for being able to get more revenue per player and attracting a totally different kind of audience from a player perspective it can kill the game since it turns it in to something many of them intentionally avoided in the first place you are making it more complicated than it needs to be if a plex is too big of a tool to cover all services ccp will just create smaller tokens and price every service according to these tokens example 1 plex  5 tokens 5 can be exchanged to30d gametime 1 buys new super awesome clothing set in incarna 2 buys an apearance change and so onyou point about the market doesnt make much sense since we have that already the issue never was ccp deciding the isk value of the tokens since it is assumed they allow the tokens to be traded ingame it increases the demand of the tokens bringing more money to ccp and silences some of the people complaining since you can now grind ingame for the same benefit as an additional benefit if ccp limits the services to nongameplay influencing items it wont alter the basic design of eve where you have to think and work to succeed and achieve things ingame instead of buying them that would devalue achievement in the game i think you are actually worried for no reason ccp will likely sell the services for tokens like they do with a plex there is almost guaranteed ingame trading allowed for the tokens to increase the demand the tokens will likely be universal so that no one service will be unavailable to people wanting to get the items without paying rl money for them it doesnUFFFDt make a difference to ccp since the tokens have to initially be payed in rl cash but who cares where they are spent as long as they offer only fluff
except that that is exactly what we are seeing ccp said they would limit to fluff items but already there is attribute remaps planned and later there is the special boxed edition implant that does nothing but allow gameplay advantagesfaster training and 20 bonus to rof for 35days for rl money think about that for a second  the first things they did after saying it would be fluff only was adding ingame advantages for plex and a huge boost to players buying a certain ccp product instead of subscribing to the game normally things specifically designed to give advantages over people who just pay for a subscription ccp is taking a very liberal view of nongameplay altering services in that their first new service gives a gameplay advantageyou can argue all you want how little actual difference it makes and how a newbie with a bonus rof is only competative with veterans but even if true it doesnt change the fact that they get ingame advantages over people who only pay a normal subscription for eve online a newbie who downloaded the game will get d in an otherwise even fight by a noob who bought a special edition copy of eve ccp is selling ingame advantages and every advantage was paid by rl cash by someone this is so even if they chose to trade it for isk instead earlier with plex trading it was just about trading gametime and that wasnt different from paying a normal subscription in any other way than that someone else payed your subscription fee for that monthnow you can like it or hate it but dont spout nonsense about it not giving you an advantage
edited for errorsit would seem you answered your own questionbreeder slaves are not illegal strange but true while actual slaves are illegal so you got shot for having slaves which unfortunately destroyed your breeder slavesin missions you want to be careful to not pick up illegal items unless you are willing to deal with the problems associated with them lots of missions drop extra junk and often times it is drugs or other less than legal items be sure to check the info on the item for legality in your area if it says nothing it is ok otherwise heed its warning anyway fly safe and have fun

no actually you dont have to have the cargo hold open to do that you drag to the icon on the hud to do it as well however i am ambivalent to this change it isnt necessary but i can see why you think it is annoying
seriously you had to resort to ad hominem attack i simply pointed out that your logic was flawed because you were trying to compare ships that have different roles you trivialise my post but being able to jumpbridge into a cynojammed system is a huge plus point being able to use gates means that unlike a titan you can jumpbridge from highsec or even move around without using the jump drive to get into rangeim no ccp fanboi right now however im not going complain that black ops are useless in their current form when that is clearly not the case
looki never said the ships are useless they are useful to a pointbut stating that some key ability of the thing is to jump thru conventional star gates deflects attention from the prenerfed state of the ship as relates to having to have a stupid hauler follow the thing about in order to do its job unlike any other cyno capable ship in the gameand realistically as the things cannot use a cocd jumping about through gates is a rather poor idea simply from a tactical point of viewanyway i am fully aware that i am tilting at windmills here i just find it annoying shortsighted and frustrating that a ship designed to reward nonblob mentality and create a thinking tactical option is left nerfed while capital blobonline and drakeblob online have taken over the game and even encouraged by ccps designersah well editthank crap for wormholes if they were not in the game i would have unsubbed both of my paid subscriptions quite some time ago
what about in a situation where i may be out on oversea military deployment wo internet access can i have a trusted relative who holds no interest in eve to continue skill trainingand if an employee of ccp were to discover it would they be willing to turn a blind eye knowing the circumstances behind ithypothetically speaking of course

i would love to see the sin getting 10 drones
not supported the idea is stupid if we are likening in game insurance to real life insurance no one should have insurance no insurance company would insure pod pilots ships in rl even miners technically risk there ships against belt rats although they would have to be afk or stupid to die to any high sec belt rat
concord defines it as a criminal act getting destroyed by them and then having them pay you insurance is quite stupid remove the insurance payouts for high sec ganks
supported crime should pay in eve but shouldnt pay that well

no well sort ofi really like people bying plex in the eve interface nothing beats making a bunch of isk selling it to someone else and playing eve more or less for free and i really dont mind letting people pay for a remap i guess in theory you could constantly remap for whatever skills you happen to have in your queue this would get them a higher sp per hour average but you get a remap every few months for free anyway a few months is really not that bad and its about what youd spend on a decently focused training regimen anywaywhat i really dont want to see is the korean mmo thing where they charge you real money for an awesome sword or something eve already has a crazy time investment until you can become competent at the game i really dont want to have to add a 50 awesome gear micro transaction on top of thatand yes i saw the cosmetic only option but i agree with the previous posters if you open the microtransaction door its not to long until some corporate higher up decides that people should be paying more money
noevery game i have seen going this way got worse because of it more and more attention goes to superficial additions just to be able to rig in more cash in the end the game suffers heavilyand dont even get started with that cosmetic only stuff thats where it starts but never where it endsthe plex system is great in fact its genius every pay to play game should have it but that is where it should stop no remaps for plex no skillpoint buying not even pink paint for your ships for 2
noid rather pay more for my accounts ill end up quitting the game altogether if ccp continues down this road
no unless new cosmetic things are introduced to the game not just for the walking in stations stuff but the ability to customize shipskinshave alliancecorp decals and the like then id be all right with some cosmetic only microtransactions

just break out the resist bonus that afs get so that people stop whiningie give the jag the same resists as the sabre claw hound and then the additional resists found on the jag hull can be broken out and made the 4th bonus please oh please do not do dumb things like give the jag tracking bonuses or ab bonuses though giving the retri 1 med slot in exchange for a low would be fine
blasters really do need some love
support the optimal range boostreason it seems the optimal range is lacking compared too the guns tracking speed when using the highest hitting ammo and thus shortest optimal range this specially happens when using the smallest of the three gun types in every category of size smallmediumlarge  eg light electron blasters heavy electron blasters electron blaster cannonsmoar optimal plz by about 10 so if its 10km make it 11km etc
10
do you really think 1km of optimal will solve the blaster problem
ok id only support this if your character in station could shoot at and kill other characters in a mechanic similar to getting podded i dont care if the erp station ends up being in jita or rens ill get my little pedestrian concorded just to shoot at pervertsthe one thing i worry about with incarna is that eve will essentially turn into two games one will be classic eve in space where refined gentlemen play the market in between managing vast empires and engaging in rousing bouts of intelligible combatand the other will be space second life in which a bunch of greasy perverts sit in their parents basements with the door locked and the blinds drawn spending hour after hour pleasuring their neither regions that look suspiciously like the neither regions of the strippers on screen all while their character stands like a statue in the main lobby of some virtual strip jointand you know its only a matter of time before every weirdo with a robust and detailed character creation engine and a fetish starts up some sort of sex for plex scheme also youll get rp guilds starting up that doesnt sound bad until you look at some of the pedophile rp guilds that keep getting in trouble over in wowi wouldnt really mind this so much there would just be certain stations that you do not dock in and even if there are two different types of eve you can stay out of the one you dont like however one of them will get on fox news and its not going to be serious space ships for refined gentlemen
good research sir

pretty much yeah
nice ideas would be cool to see more eafs around theyre nice little ships that are currently sorely underpowered

it has always bugged me that the kitsune has a lower lock range and scan res than the griffinsupported
yep they need a buff
my overall feeling is that eass being terrible is just one aspect of a wider imbalance tldr is that interceptors are allround really good at all the things youd want in a pvp frigate hull which makes the other pvp frigates mostly surplus to requirementshaving said that an eas tweaking would be nice to see
while my initial thought was  buff their ehp to the level of an af this sounds good aswell
you want to be able to destroy stations youre losing while still being able to get your stuff out at your conveniencelike self destructing a ship and the modules arent destroyed but go into a permanent wreck that only you can loot not supported if youre that spiteful to deny a station to those whove beaten you be ready to lose everything when you pop the station
here is where i point out your data only shows the number of player owned outposts vs player owned systems it does not in fact show the hundreds upon hundreds of completely unconquered space because lets face it its largely worthless
excellent
note that wrecking a station would imply having system control for at least 8 hours thats an odd definition of beatenbut even if it werent what of it i can self destruct a ship why not a station the basis of my proposal is that outposts just arent that special any more
here is where i point out that you should learn both to read and to count maths is really pretty easy once you try to learn it and there are lots of good people willing to help you startafter that you can make a start on basic logic  which will perhaps enable you to explain why the number of claimed systems is in any way relevantonce you have done that then youll be in a position to possibly make a useful contribution to this thread
i like that idea
im not sure that its really needed to make them recoverable its not like its that hard to build them however if they are recoverable then the upgrades should not be

no remap for plex ccp getting greedy maybe change from 12 month to 6 month
id just like to thank ccp for going through with this despite the forum outpouring of tearsanyone who thinks this is stepping over some invisibile line is a moron
im not sure i really care its not a feature im ever likely to use but if someone else wants to pay 15 to squeze out a few extra sp let them
currently capital ship bobbing is out of control on the next expansion ccp will be introducing microtransactions time to take advantage of that i propose the following to solve the capitalsonline issueintroduce an added subscription fee for capital ships if you dont have the appropriate licence then no character on your account can board the ship carrier lbs 499 dreadnought 799 supercarrier 2999 titan 4999those are per month also the numbers can be adjusted to fit the business modelpros  this would separate the series players from the casual ones high sec would be unaffected no more unnecessary hot drops on a lone t1 battleship in low sec because of a bored scar pilot extra income for ccp to reinvest in projects like evecons  if your in a super capital and you let your titanscar pilot licence expire then after down time you log in then you will be in a pod next to the titanscarfeedback is welcome and trolling will not be tolerated
supporting a good decision
stupid stupid idea
you are welcome to remove 499lbs from me for my capital subscriptioni am trying to lose weight anyway
never gonna happen
those exact words were uttered by ccp about microtransactions
and just like with microtransactions they are right until ccp proves them wrong
so i guess you have not read the forums or watched or read any recent ccp interviews recently ehh we are a month away from microtransactions now this proposal is not about if they should be allowed or not if you keep trying to derail my thread i will report you and you will be banned any part of this not crystal clear

oh look its crono effect without the capsboldtype and still the same amount of aragonce and stupidity wrapped into one nice little packagenever mind the fact that it takes 6 months to a year to get into a cap not to mention a great deal of isk and time and effort to be able to replace the damn things when you blow im upif it was that easy my alliance would have a crapload of themjust how bold faced foolish can you getoh wait your trolling arent you hmmm i need more coffee
i loledhard over thisi sincerely hope taht he is trolling this is by far the worst idea ive seen around its only a step away from paying monthly for evry ship you fly
1m isk that this is cromos new alt
you should wait for a month or two after plex remap will be on tq then its will not be so stupid alreadynot supported anyway
it already costs 800m isk for the capital and racial carrier skillbooks alone to use an examplecouple this with a minimum of 2 years training time to fly a capship even remotely competently and i feel the bar is already set high enoughnot supported
definitely not supportedlax
supporting an excellent idea obviously capital pilots get more fun out of the game so they should pay more
yeh i had in mind different ships thanks for pointing that dunno why but i always think that domi has 5 per level on armor repaire efficiency instead of l hybrid damagemegathron err if blaster fitted in need mwd bonus deimos should get a mwd speed bonus too less cap only sucks and yeah fail hac
just give the hulls bigger capacitors maybe a slight neut resist bonus or somethingthats if gallente are going to be stuck with the most utterly ed play style ever
supportedi also think using reaction silos to produce booster intermediates is kind of a pain in the assplus there are all these boosteronly production slots on outposts that are totally silly and rarely used
sounds good the comedown period should be double the duration of the positive effect and double the intensity of the effect so if a booster lasted 15 minutes and boosted your shield repair rate by 25 the comedown period would be 30 minutes and a 50 reduction in shield repair
the biggest problem with boosters now is getting the materials needed for productionthe amount of available materials is so low and if you put that together with the isk it takes to set up a production line you get extremely high prizes for boosters which leads to low usei looked into booster production but apparently each type of gas is only available in 1 region of 00 which makes it hard to produce boosters if you dont live in those regions

making textures with camoflauge jungle camo desert camo any sort of camoseriously navy ships dont need jungle camo also with the textures of the sansha ships on sisi being dipped in the jungle camo paint i think now is the time to call them and tell them to stop with the camo paint jobs and get ideas from the community on how to paint the shipssign if you support the idea of removing the camo paint jobs for something more spacey or tell ccp to put trees in space
camo is supposed to be contextsensitive if they want to put camo on it should resemble  roughly  the background in eve lots of black maybe some stars smattered about or some touches of color for nebulae
camo on space ships is bad camo on space ships where the effective size of a blotch of the cammo is probably as large as a forest itself kind of ruins the perceived size of the ship alsowhat exactly are the ships hiding in that they want to blend in is it in case they crash land on a temperate world in a forest
 bug buster  btw is there any way to save groups in fittings its kind of annoying to group every ship newly fittedthis too
while i can see the grouping information being saved the ammo stuff might be tricky eg some people need containers to hold all the charges
this topic is posted what once every week or so and what will the majority of people saynooooooooo
but why would you want to do this just get an alt that way you can have both characters in space at the same time and you can have 6 characters if you want to manufacture
ccp for the good of eve hire me bottom line your getting light on the content for this game you have a huge backlog of bugs and balance issues you need to increase revenue sources from eve to improve the state of the expansions and patches because your other projects are requiring more of your employees and its starting to show your going to scare off the veterans if this game goes the way of microtransactions even in a cosmetic sense because the community does not have the faith that it will stop there so you need ways to increase revenue by thickening current streams and opening new ones all without causing a backlash from your most vocal players its lucky for you i really love this game and happen to have several well thought out solutions this is a serious post im a theorist i have an iq of 138 i think very out of the box which is what you need and i play eve religiously you need fresh ideas because lately theyve just been stale eve can out innovate the competition instead of give way to ityou dont have to believe in me to vote this up just what i have to say
no
someone with an iq of 138 ought to be smart enough to send a job application to hr instead of a suggestions box
as cool as it might be to be employed by ccp i was using that to make a point about ccp not using their most valuable asset which is the diverse thinking of their customers all of the forums for ideas and proposals have threads that are years old and if ccp would have an actual presence here and involve themselves more with the community directly in intelligent discussion they could come up with innovative solutions for their problems i know the representatives are a step towards communication and im not arguing that they shouldnt be there only that more needs to be donewould i do all of this and more for ccp sure do i think they will hire me or did i make this as a resume no if you cant keep up with my point why bother replying
are you sure youre seriousbecause this is either the dumbest post ive ever read or a trollplease be a troll
im sure if you were actually applying to ccp only having an iq of 138 on your resume wouldnt get you far
which means he has an iq of 8 and not 138but thats besides the point hes right however ccp is frakking up royally but this troll isnt how you deal with it
ok yes eve is primarily a pvp focused sandbox but that doesnt mean the missions have to be boring why not have interesting missionsas far as game play goes we need something more than go here and shoot waves of bad guys take this box 4 jumps away and drop it off in station or go mine roidsand as far as the mission flavor text goes i did like the linked missions and the epic arcs the mission text did help cut down the tedium granted digging dolls out of asteroids was a bit odd really didnt make you feel like the capsuleer demigod the intro movie hyped you up to beactually id like to see the mission text do more to let you know about the lore of eve after all this time all i ever did was install the game watch the intro movie and read a bit of mission text i know more about alliance politics than i do about new edenspeaking of which did you know that by lore there are futanari in the gelente faction
nofor a couple of reasons1 how do you figure out who sets them off or not itd have to be some sort of standings comparison vs the person who put them down and even then do they go off when neutrals come by or reds2 if you dont let people put them on gates then nobody will use them its like saying you cant put warp disruption bubbles on gates3 if you do let people put them on gates then 00 alliances will lock down a pocket of systems by getting everyone to skill up mines then spam the entrance gate4 only the cloaked ones will get used if they detonate at 25km then people will just warp to the minefield within 50km with a ship that can shoot things from that far away and then just creep towards the minefield blasting distant mines as they goyou could fix this by having the mines being cloaked then when you get too close they decloak and fly at you then you have a set amount of time to lock on and shoot them before they get you actually that could be pretty fun
not supportedas horrible as current invention chances are the market is fairly balanced around them i understand where this topic comes from from an rp standpoint but not every game design decision has to make sense from an rp standpoint after all its not like youre forced to do nothing but invest the time inventing while the job is running
i think the real problem is with the quality of the rng in the gamemy experience has been that results do not follow the expected bivariate distribution i do not have the timeinclination to run chisquared tests against them one relatively simple way to create more meancentered results would be to create a hidden luck variable when delivering multiple jobs if your last delivery was a success the luck variable goes negative and it goes positive after each failure this was the technique that they used in dungeon master 
hmm  we have about 1year 10months worth of inventions tracked and the average success rate matches the expected value over all corp members and the last 30days it is 4894 thats the number i have easily accessible in the app according to the invention calculator it should be 4849
i was hoping we could start seeing faction npcs in wh space quite soon as we all know wh space is unclame able no mooning ect so why not ccp have the facation npcs move in as whell as been in noraml space reson for this they could start building dockable stations and start porction there owme subsytems making t3 a realy cool prodction lineat the same time for people living in wh space it would give them new isk rescorse to be self suffient in wh space the only dwar back is the facation npcs that move in would have to be t2 fitted but this will draw in new players and old players there also any whay thanks for reading not the best poster in the world but please enjoy and look foward to reading you comments
you already have the sleepers in there thats not enough for you to earn money
sleeprs are cool dont get me worng what i mean buy this is pruley to bring in t3 facaton ships and new t3 ships made buy npcs thats what i ment buy all npcs sorry they also as a twist could have no bountys at all just drops
drones dont have bounty either yet entire drone regions exist drop there is much more difficult to haul out than you t3 lootjust wait for the new salvage ship ccp will deploy in next expansion

idea needs a lot of work i do agree that something needs to be done to make wh space a little more livable i dont see any reason why the pirate factions wouldnt want in on the fun either but it needs to be thought out before you post it here

tbh wrg to vuk lau quoted by op  he stated the problem  many 00 alliances have funding issues fine its perfectly plausible without getting into details of the sizecomposition and where on the eve map are these alliances located  then he says there are huge amount of isk in the game and states the source is not 00 i would counter this by examining the isk density per population vs system sec especially after dominion not withstanding taking into account the mineral exports coming from 00 especially the drone regions that will give a more accurate picture to debunk the risk argument deep 00 are almost as safe as highsec if a whole swath of the area is under constant nap even more so you can use the risk argument but it wont carry much water imo he then states the biggest 00 problem is population density no easy solution which true assuming his proposal as partial remedy to this problem has something to do with implementing more 00 entry points then i would have to ask what problem does it solve how does he equate population density to the number of entry points bearing in mind players playstyle and inclination no if you want to lower the living cost the direct way is best  lower the sovereignty costs a the ripple effect is selfcontained and you can opt for a dynamic scaling yes im aware about the difficulties of deep 00 alliances in the fringes in moving things to market hence the dynamic scaling of sovereignty costs say from the center for the universe  jita it is as it should be and its not a real problem  the same way as woods  village  towns  cities  metropolis aka jitab the effect affects everyone in 00 as opposed to the static geolocation in the proposed entry points which may favour certain alliancespower blockscall me paranoid but the proposal to increase the number of 00 entry points may seem reasonable but it looks to me as a veiled attempt to shorten the logistic ops to highsec market centres  which if done incorrectly benefits certain geo locations even if it was done correctly the homogeneity will destroy eve in the long term i hope the ccp game designers have enough foresight to recognize that blandness will kill a game not a matter of if its a matter of when i do not believe addressing the number of entry points into 00 will partly solve the 00 population issue youre more likely to open a new can of worms concentrate on the fundamentals instead of the window dressingbetter clarity
the only thing that has been consistent with each csm has been scandal for those that have moot been keeping up please read this thread
all i see is a bunch of speculation with no proof by some idiot who reads like he has an axe to grind with just about everybody like most people in that thread i simply say who gives a  theyre getting results and thats what matters
i cant see any sort of scandal youre alluding to the worst that is going on is two csm members disagreeing about formalinformal communications big deal were 9 different people who will disagree at timesinstead of posting ridiculous claims op should focus on their terrible ah proposal it seems to be somewhat lacking in support
for those who cant be arsed to click the link thats because its ed just so you know
my ah thread is about a balance for capitals but lets not derail this thread and focus on the activities of a csm member that has quickly turned the first respected csm into lolcsm
there has been nothing more than an unsubstantiated rumour at this point as the csm member this is directed towards has denied the rumour and nobody has provided any evidence showing otherwise im happy to give them the benefit of the doubt and let the matter rest
i dont know mazz is going off the handle about mynxe is accusing her of so you down playing thing with your damage control is not going to help
some drama between 2 csm members is hardly a scandal in fact on the internet its basically commonplace of course if youre intent on seeing scandals everywhere you could with a lot of effort inflate this to be one but itd be a rather boring scandal to be honest 
if this is what passes for scandal on csm 5 then son i am disappoint
supportedin addition to tweaks to the individual bo ships and significant jump range boost i also think that this class of ship and every covops ship should be removed from local chat to make them genuinely stealthy
cosmetic onlyship and character texture options would be pretty sweet amongst other thingshow cool would it be for a roleplaying corp to have uniforms or a gang full of ships with a unique texturemassive opportunities here it wouldnt effect the people who dont want anything to do with micro transactions but would give some cool options for those that do and another source of revenue for our ccp overlords
no

i would saymegathrons and rokhs with large railguns work badferox and any ship with medium railguns work worseit is time to rework railguns
wouldnt mind seeing small tracking increase for rails minor and up the multiplier for damage by 1020 
making eafs more viable would be nice indeed
either this or make them cost half as much to make the former is still better
reasonable and welcome changes
valid concise purposefull
great idea
yes the eafs simply dont do anything unique at the moment and they all to one extent or another require festooning with faction mods to have any chance of doing what the bonuses suggest they are meant towishlisting from here on inhyena id like to see 25km t2 webs and a 5 velocity bonus per skill level rather than making it a frigate killer by giving it a dronebay of note and turrets crazy fast frigate neutralizer please being able to web something like a dramiel to the point you can outrun it and take away its almost pre speed nerf agility nicesentinel is pretty good as is but id like to see it be able to field 5 light drones with having no turret or missile slots as penancekeres is pointless unless you want to set yourself a challenge let it scram people at 20 km with max skills and t2 and make it hated and loved perhaps a range bonus to warp scrams only and not disruptorskitsune needs serious ecm cap reduction to make that idea work an increase in lock range and sensor strenght and possibly redesign of slot layouts
saying ur bad at math doesnt do anything to make my point less valid you still have yet to show us where you found a count of how many 00 systems there are total
an excellent idea and well laid out ccp give this one a serious look

sounds good not super high priority but would be nicewould also like to see engine trails backit would also be nice if missiles had an effect making it look like they came out of launchers at the moment they just sort of spawn from the midpoint salvage beam is the same
support as long as it isnt diverting resources away from other teams working on improving existing material like maybe fw or missions getting some attention and as long as minimum graphics still has pretty low requirements
i have been looking at getting tech 2 pulses to go with my autos and being a big fan of the tech 1 cruiser line up thats the first place i think of when i decide what weapon to trainthe omen is the definition of a laser platform and the only ammar cruiser that gets a dmg bonus that makes them more effective then unbonused auto cannons the direct problem is its fitting it is way harder to fit out especially for a newer playereven with all skills at 5 it requires 0 cpu resistance plates and a power grid rig to fit a tech 2 pulse and a 800mm platemwd even then you need the highest of meta mods to put it all together without going over cpuwith most people flying zealots and moving on to the harb it is easy to forget that this should be a new players first armor laser ship above the frigate class and should be fit with tech 1 and low meta gear at newbe skillelectronics and engineering 4 i did some eft work on my near skilless hauler alt caila boosting her eft skill to what a new ammar pilot would have and what a tech 2 ammar pilot would have to make comparisons and came to the following conclusions boost the grid by 75 to allow a armor pulse fit at all levels of skill boost cpu by 50 to allow for a greater mix of mods and meta levelsas you know the vexor rupture arbitrator moa stabber and thorax have the fitting to excell in there combat roles without the use of rigs and expensive high meta mods i think new ammar pilots should have the same opportunity especially since no other cruiser gets the all important dmg bonus which will become a big part of there line upplease give your support and discuss i will be glad to change the proposal based on your suggestions
looks good no reason it shouldnt be somewhat comparable to other t1 cruisers

said the two days old alt out of curiosity do you already have your cerebral accelerator plugged in cause ccp would never give anyone who pays additional rl cash any type of advantage
tldr asteroid belts turned into single large asteroids asteroids are cat scanned to find ores inside to get to the ore the miner first has to drill away useless rock and then mine the exposed mineralsfor this new system to work some changes have to be made to certain items and mechanics in evenew asteroidsasteroids will have to be a lot fewer and larger what is a belt today would be pretty much a single asteroideach asteroid also contains many minerals not just a single onenew asteroid scannerwhen activating the new scanner on an asteroid the ship will go into geosynchronous orbit around it that is the ship will follow the asteroids rotation and will be unbumpableonce the scanner is active a new asteroid view mode will be available the asteroid is viewed in depth slices like a cat scanthe goal for the miner is to find areas in the asteroid with high concentrations of the mineral hes after he does this by going through different depths of the asteroid with the scanner and thereby observing the composition of the asteroidnew mining laser configurationsall mining lasers will now have to use crystals two new crystals are added the all purpose drilling crystal and the all purpose mining crystalto get to the sweet spots the miner will first have to dig away the useless rock around it this is done with the drilling crystal at this stage it might be a good idea to reposition your ship so as little drilling as possible opens up as much minerals as possible once the area is uncovered the miner switches to the mining crystal either all purpose or one of the specific ones the mining crystals can dig through rock as well but not as quickly the drilling crystals will on the other hand drill through everything and never deposit anything to the ship so if youre not careful you will burn away valuable mineralsstrip miners are of course more effective than normal mining lasers but they will also be more blunt while they will quickly dig through rock and suck up whats inside they will leave scraps behind that they cant waste time to collect this gives newer miners an excellent opportunity to help in any mining op or to have something left to mine in the starter systemsi also think this would reduce macro miners as it will be a system that is pretty hard to automategraphically it will also look pretty cool where mined out asteroids will be unstable and full of holes giving an indication that there is no use in attempting any further mining at that site
nice i might even be tempted to mine again if this were the case immersion in mining who would have thought  oh btw mix this up with the modular pos idea and u can set up short term mining faciities wich store and process to a degree minerals then dismantled and moved to a new location this ofcrs is a fantacy gives mining ops a totally new meaning
i like it i think the same could be acomplished with ice make public ice comets that appear on the overveiw and ones with rarer types scanable some rules apply to minning them as astroroidsfood for thought
one problem i see is that with the level of tech we have in eve theres not really anything useless whatsoever everything can be broken down to its base elements therefore useless is purely an extension of market valueotherwise making mining ice and ore more active sounds great to me
really capital pilots get more fun reallyi dunno man i have more fun in a rifter than in a chimera in fact capital ships have more restrictive gameplay cant go in high sec for caps cant dock for supercamps and above cant use gates so why should they pay more for less contenti agree that there is an increase of capitals and supercaps in the game there are also that many that will exploderize remember one of the eve online rules you will diebesides bigger ship  bigger target simple as that
maybe same style of stupidity i will place that betone million isk on weither this is cromo i get a mil if its some random idiotshakealso not supportededit also how did you lose a dramiel to a badger

no thank you we already pay 15 a month on each account unless you remove that fee i dont aprove this microtransaction bs
try again ccp clearly stated that micro transactions wouldnt have any ingame impact it would be more for cosmetic things like furry hats an stuff like that
one of the worst proposals so far so yeah not supportedit takes a lot of time to get into carriersdreadssctitans not to mention a lot of isk if you dont like getting killed by caps then get your own just dont come here to try and punish those who put in a ton more training and isk than you into pvp for a single ship and then complain they shoot you cant realy expect to beat an f16 with a paper plane and then go tell the f16 pilots to pay moar
is that you cromo effect
pay per game content great idea i sugegst that all hisec players pay an extra 10 a month as they are safe lowsec players play for free as lowsec content sucks and all 00 people have to donate all their stuff to me sound fair
i would gladly pay the high sec tax if all the ninja salvagers and suicide gankers have to pay it too seriously the op is a damned troll and everyone in this thread knows it quit while youre ahead
this sounds like punish the capsuperspilots for using the game as it is for having spent billions and billions of isk for skills fitting and ship and had to pay their accounts for all that time which means years to finally be a cap pilot regardless of the restrictions capsupers pilots have the costs and the need of logistics in case of the supers an dedicated alt that already cost the fee for an extra accountthats just one of the stupidest things ive ever heared in my entire eve timepro this will separate the serials from casuals what a damn bull this will just introduce a 2 class society btwunnessesary hotdroplol unnessesary maybe but why are they doing it because they can and lowsec isnt meant to be a safe place for ppl like you thats for what the empire is forthis also ignores the simple fact that eve is now 7 years old which includes a significant increase of ppl finally able to be a cap pilotwas the same as they introduced battleshipsarent they out of control there are still more battleships in eve than capsthis trolling is just bull and ofc not supported
hifirstly i apologise if this has already been proposed i could not find it while searchingi know the contacts system can be used in a variety of different ways but i want to suggest a small change if you happen to flag a corporate and that corporation then closes can that corporation and flag be removed from either your personal or corporate listing it becomes very tedious having to go through and check to see if the corporation is still openin usewith this in mind can i also propose that if you declare war against a corporation that the war automatically retracts once the corporation closesi welcome your thoughts on the matterkro
the massive hitpoint buffer and modest dps lowers the drakes battlefield target priority substantially and all the while the ship can comfortably do what it does best hit hard and soak up damage like a spongeyou are contradicting yourself in the same paragraphmodest dps and hit hard i think your initial assesment is truedrakes are popular because they are a low priority target having modest dps and big tankwho want to be in the harbycane in a gang full of drakes of course the bcu versus pdudcu slot choice is where the drake has its firepower v defence choice to be madei dont understand why you think it is possible to fit max attack and max defence at the same time you make your choices when fitting a drake like anyother shipand its most def not possible to fit make dpstank with a mwd and medium neut  tackle these are all choicesthe cpugrid of the drake is fine it prevent max t2 fits allready

shows what you know people always try to shoot my gilathen i warp into a space desert and laugh at themi like guristas ship choice but the mission mega and domi should be the navy paint scheme also on caldari shipsnavy raven and scorp it looks stupid
fully supported the machariel is a goregeous and powerful bastard of a boat but the camo is odd to say the least
yes it ruins the ships and the atmosphere when playing completely not fun look at the widow if you want proper faction textures or so black  red  win
please eve online art department employeesstop being idiots and make things look better instead of worse as it stands people are mad at you this is somewhat badthink of the playersedit enough ships have been ruined end the madness
forest camo in space makes perfect sense no wait it doesnt
i like the urban camo ones they at least blend in a bit when you zoom out a little if it werent for all the bloody blinking lights only thing is anything else would be garish or very boring i pray to god they never give the players the ability to paint our own ships
just because i want my barney and baby bop colored legion doesnt mean you have to drive it you can keep your hotwheels red thorax xdjoking aside and back to the opening postit is not a good idea to tell them to stop instead ask them to change direction let them do the camo but give us a selection of skins maybe 2 or 3 different choices that we could chose to use on our ship that way they dont get bogged down with allowing player complete control but it also allows us to make at least slight choices in the way we want to look it also allows them to continue with some of the things that they want to do camo paint schemes personally i like the scorpions paint i think it fits in with its attitude of you dont see meis it a little out of place yes but i still like it
i was leaning that way once too but every added camo paint brings me closer to the other extreme paintjobs similar to tweaked cars or planes would be actually much easier to live with and if ccp is the one making them or choosing from player made ones im certain it will all be in good taste that is exactly the kind of thing i could see someone doing to his spaceship i could handle the camo too if it was a choice instead of a giant case of forced stupidity they dropped on the players
its not like any sort of camo would help at all in space combat if anything the ships would be painted with something that helps deflect laser fire which has no reason to be mottled or patchy who cares if they can see you if they have you on visual you are already way too close to hide dsupported
agreed leave strange camo paints to the groundponders in dust
supported x1000camo in space is just plain silly
if we were taking these ships into combat in south america then i would understand camouflage space ships fight in space honestly i would expect the navy variants to be brightly colored and shiny based on the backstory stuff space camo would be black after all hate the camo it is on par with painting daisies on the side of the ships in my opinion
my ships come from south america and i dont want them camo painted1
i support the idea to put trees in spaceseriously largescale space hydroponics would make for some cool structures to fly and pew pew around

i have been researching and testing and doing a lot of balancing on sov warfare after close to over 100 hrs the following will solve the problem in 00 pos will now be anchored at planets to claim sov instead of moons this will help tie into dust 514 when it is released cyno jammers are unaffected by sbus and now will be an aoe module each cyno jammer placed will cover a 2550 au range so the smaller the system the less you need to cyno jam the entire system also the bill for these should be adjusted accordingly if you dont have sov in a system but own the station then part of the tax you get from players from the station goes to the sov holder percentage is up for debate sbus will have the effective hit points and volume lowers to help encourage small gang warfare gorilla gang warfare toobelow are major changes ihubs can be anchored at a pos and have a lower volume this is so they can fit in a jump freighter and smaller alliances do not have to worry about running some 00 bottle neck gate camp thus allowing smaller alliances the ability to gain access to 00 tcus will be removed from the game station services along with the station itself will have the ehp reduced to make it more tangible for small gangs to have an impact on it sov can be claimed by corporations as well as alliances ihub volume will be 200km3ihub timers are now changed to one hour cycleschanges to stations you can leave a station free for anyone to claim if you are the holding corp for said station when station is abandoned the health status goes to zero so anyone claiming the station has to repair shield armor and hull station shields have zero shield recharge so they will not passively repairbig changes to sbus anchoring sbus on 51 of the gates or more will freeze all upgrades with the exception of cyno jammers once sbus are removed the upgrades pick up where they left off new sbu resistances are 0 when anchoring 25 when onlining and then 50 when finally online there is a anchoring and onlining bonus the more sbus you put down that way if the sov holder kills one sbu and puts you below the 51 mark you can get back in action without having to wait the three hours that bonus is 50 per sbu sbu hit points with the exception of shields will be reduced to 25 million hit points and the volume decreased to 300 meters cubed this allows small type gangs and ships to be able to carry these and encourage small gang warfarepos fighting claiming sov will require the pos to be at a planet with the claim sov box check marked pos can still be anchored at moons for logistics moon mining and reactions and such thingsmore major changes alliances have to claim a constellation as being its capital or home alliances can still claim any claimable system in the entire universe all sov payments will remain the same if you claim a system outside of your homecapital constellation then the upgrade cost will start to go up only two jump bridges will be allowed in a constellation jump bridges can not be online if a cyno jammer is present cyno jammer online timers will be reduced to ten minutesthere you have it sov system solved and allowing all entities to have a shot in 00 now that my brain practically exploded with the balancing part of this im off to get some much deserved cake
i can see how you have done all the testing of that the rest of the post is just as ridiculous if anyone else looks here first and wants to save 5 minutes of their lives
so after burning down the entire south i can tell you that all of your ideas piled on top of whoever came up with this terrible idea for sov should be herded with their creators into a large furnace and set to broil
cloaking should not be 100 automatic unattended immunity to detection every hostile on grid should be facing an element of risk that requires them to stay active and a superior opposition to hunt them down meanwhile cloaked ships especially acting in gangs are a substantial threat with complete control over engagement range initiative and whether to engage in addition to allowing them to gather information in the heart of hostile territory including the existence of gate camps designed to combat themlogically projecting an energy field such as a cloak would lead to the development of tools to detect the methods that cloaked ships use the continuing development of these opposing tools as they strive to defeat one another can be assumed on the other hand the idea that one module allows you complete and indefinite protection from every sensor known to evescience at any range and even if they know you are there is unlikely1 this should be achieved by having specific probes with a long probe cycle basically long enough for a skilled cloak pilot to get on the move that could get a lock on a cloaked ship though an active covert pilot who keeps his ship moving should still be very safe these probes should be exclusive to covert ops  recon craft to increase their role in the game alternatively this role could be given to electronic attack craft if they need a role boost more1b optional to make the hunt more of a game it could be that a cloaked ship with zero velocity is more stealthy this means the cloak pilot gets to choose between being harder to lock down stop move stop or harder to catch burn the goal is that the chase is actually somewhat fun as opposed to the current mechanics which primarily rely on tedium and being afk2 i also suggest these probes are slightly more effective versus stealth bombers you want to pack threat you worsen your stealth to once again increase the role for covert ops craft and differentiate between the two ships at the moment it makes more sense to scout in a stealth bomber ships that are not specialist recon vessels are slightly easier to probe3 i would suggest black ops battleships gain a gang bonus that multiplies the detection effect to increase their value a black ops battleship and supporting small recon or eaf ships should be able to pose a sufficient threat to hostile cloaked ships that they can be swept from the hot systemi know being able to project threat while solo against immense corporations is fun so i expect lots of its fine were harmless you just need to htfu likewise i have seen other threads suggesting recon cloak fuel and anticloak depth charges the fuel approach doesnt solve afk cloaking without becoming a real logistical pain to every use of a cloak it is also an automatic limit rather than one based on an active opposition the bomb approach is effectively useless other than against a recon ship scouting gate camps where the cloaked craft already faces a substantial element of riskin practice this doesnt change too much since nonafk cloakers can still just logoffski and wait for the hunters to get bored so theyre still pretty safe even when deep in hostile space and able to look for easy ganks it does mean afk cloakers can be hunted down and systems made harder to scout by a determined geared and active oppositionand no ive never lost a ship to a stealth craft personally
it isnt approach the cloaked ship to closer than 2000m and it decloaks
wow this is so coolnoones ever thought of this beforeits such an incredibly original and well thought out ideaanyone care to link the 5 million identical postsstop trying to find a solution to afk cloakers theyre only a problem to nullsec carebearsid actually be quite interested in getting more interesting stealth mechanics a manner of countering a stealth ship actively hunting you but ohno my local isnt all blue is the funniest kind of crywhine because it comes from the supposedly hardcore 00 types
the mods should really start considering afk cloaker posts as spam and start banning people
1i guess mark is camping goonies now that bca moved out
aww good for u cause seeing as how your blob still keeps u all safe and sound from this alleged oneman army ure so scared to death of  this alone invalidates your entire argumentwhine but thx for disproving the horrors of afk cloaking for us with that wall of whine as a bonus

thumbs up

good counterarguments
why should we repeat something that simple research with evesearch would tell you anyway you dont really expect your idea is new do you
i propose a drone bay big enough to fit a set of bombers and a set of carriers in the blogs and stuff they talk about appropriate use of said bombers and fighters and how we should switch to one or the other based on what we are up againstlinkageread at the bottom right below the graphs
emphasis minei think you meant to say big enough to fit a set of bombers and a set of fightersallowing a supercarrier to haul around a carrier might be overkill much less allowing it to haul around an entire set of carriers i dont know enough about capital warfare to support or oppose the idea of a supercarrier carrying a set of fighters and a set of bombers
id rather see them not being able to fit both bombers and fighters they are annoying enough as it is they shouldnt be super best at taking out everything from frigate size to carrier size there has to be limits

speculation people might be less willing to spam them at chokepoints into their constellations if the mines attacked everyone friend and foe once placed like real world mines
in that case the opposite would happen they would use them to spam chokepoints for their enemies and induce omgwtfbbq levels of lag jumping into the system youd be dead before the grid loadedof course thats no different than today so
seems like a fairly obvious dodge op and while i admire the effort to try and drum up a relavent discussion in this forum that kind of thing doesnt happen very often most posters here are either too invested in the interests of the candidate in question in vuks case thats a lot of people in the nc or theyre just out to trollfact is figures from the most recent devblog make it patently obvious that l4 mission runners are not the greatest faucet around and anomalies are probably generating 23 or more of the total isk being shelled out by concord for those dead npcs is it inpart due to nap politics and 00 regions becoming safer than motsu probably is that also related to postdominion lag almost certainly but the issue of churn and new player growth in nullsec is much older than that dominion was meant as a reform for nullsec but it actually created even more hardened and immovable power blocs than ever beforethe short of it is this vuk has a very obvious interest in the longevity of his coalition and you cannot blame him for representing his people this is merely a prime example of why ccp is quite corret to blatantly ignore the csm when they see fit the csm like most any representative body are not in it for us they are in it for themselves and those whom they are closest to if an unfounded redirect to nerf highsec is seen as the most effective way to keep ccp from making incredibly large and overextended powers in nullsec change how they do business then that is what he will do
they already made dozens hundreds more connections from 00 to empire 15 years ago last time i was stuck in deep drone regions 50 jumps from anywhere it took me 3 jumps and 15 minutes of scanning to be back in highsec main issue imo continues to be the fact that riskreward of highsec makes no sense fix that and you fix lots of issues with this game good luck fixing it without a massive outcry from highsec bears tho
it sounds like you answered the question for yourself 00 alliances might make more than you do but their fixed and variable costs are significantly higher than yours in the end they arent sitting on a giant pile of cash because it just gets fed into keeping the alliance running

no to microtransactions entirelyid sooner the monthly sub went up than that
yes as i think i wrote before higher subscription fee is far better than any microtransactionsbecause higher cost of subscription not spoil the current game worldand any microtransactions will cast a shadow on this universe so its will be just another mmo that you spend time money and then sell your account and forget all of thisi think thats why this game still alive and why there is so much players which plays 5 and more yearsim here because of this too actually im not playing games very much especially any online rpg fps  its simply boring and obvious to me but i still play eve and its will be no its arleady very dissapointing that we have such topics there with plex remaping and this its feels like soon we loose this atmosphere that makes eve so eve and its will be just a moment in memories like from other very old great games or movies its still be alive and maybe even more proffitable for ccp but i think its will be not a game which can lock imagination beyond the game just another waste of time for peoples that have to many of issorry about this wall of text trying to write some complicated thing in short if something of this including remap for plex will be implemented i will loose a last reason to be interested in this game

useless bump on a sticky thread grinjust updated the list to include the latest progress including a bonus itembonus add faction deadspace and officer icons csmplease let me know if you see completed items appear on sisi
says it all i agree with the tldr but im not so sure i am a fan of the specific bonus changes when the keres was announced i was so excited to be able to fly a frigate damping platform that was worth a damn  finally something to replace my damping helios but it isnt  because no damping platform was worth a damn by the time the keres hit the marketblah the idea of eafs gets me all super excited and happy but the execution makes me roll my eyeslianged i support this and you should too
suported toobut i dont thing this will happend soone
i support it even if 80 of all my assets are trapped in 00 station i dont have access to at the moment pwill bring indeed many new gameplay but yes a ship instead of a module would make a worthy new class of ship not easy to create one now and some time sink for new skills to train station destroyer lvl5 skill completed full station removal with all content  no and fortunatly people who want that dont work for the game industryshould be possible to rebuild outposti suggest you to submit it for the next csm that will happen the 2310 as for now nothing is scheduled
for everything that can be created in game no matter what it is there has to be a way to remove destroy consume or demolish it ships modules titans stations doesnt matter all things that players can create needs a method of removal because otherwise it will be spammed everywhere stations took a while to become irritatingly normal in zerosec and it may even be a bit longer before the number of outposts starts reminding of highsec stations but unless a method to get rid of them is introduced it will happen because it has to happenid not go for any weird station destroyer modules or ships though look at the things they are small outposts those things are not battle fortresses which would be cool to have layered in shells of rock shields and armor plates they are just huge buildings once you have full access to a building taking it apart is a simple matter of whether or not you want to do itin eve the method to strip apart immobile unshielded defenceless objects are mining lasers and salvagersso the logical choice would be to give two options to get the dismantling process started1 controlled deconstruction just starts a timer of about 1 week and if the station has not changed hands again by that time it is dismantled and turns into a station wreck resembling the skeletal structure of what it has once been and two containers of which one contains a takeonly hangar with everyones stuff inside where you can only access your own stuff ofc and another takeonly can that includes a portion of the stuff that was invested into building the outpost in the first place2 scuttle to do that fly in a big load of explosives which thanks to pi already exist wire the station of demolition and start a 1 day timer after that  boom outpost is turned into a wreck with the aforementioned containers the second one being empty in turn for not returning any building material the station wreck can be salvaged with capital salvagers like normal salvagers only on carriers but could work with regular salvagers too which produce a steady supply of metal scraps which nobody loves but they can be refined into tritanium at least and a little bit of actual salvage armor plates tritanium bars some circuit and capacitor stuff 45 carriers should take a few hours to pull out all available metal scraps and salvage skeletal structure of the station remainsin both cases anyone with control of the system could simply rebuild the station if he wants to using the station wreck as an already existing outpost construction platform just put the materials needed to build the outpost in the material can and rebuild it as if youd build a new onewith the ability to destroy outposts and gain something from doing it at the same time there is motivation for many entities in eve to actually do so
nice i like this idea
sounds like a good idea
not supportedthe omen has a damage bonus becouse its not meant to have these advanced fittings boosting it would make it unbalanced and hurt new players by taking away an oppertunity to struggle with the fittings for it and thus learn more about them and become better players with a better understanding of fitting mechanicsthis is eve not everything should be easy and without challenges the game is no fun dont deprive new players of this oppertunity and fun just so you can have a higher dps and cheaper suicide gank ship to commit insurance frued in in empire
unlike the thorax rupture vexor and stabber they fit fine with a dmg bonus at low skill and better at high skill that is with full a full tank and dmg modsit cant be fit with armor properly by high skill players let alone low skill players and a good sheild fit requires a ton of fitting skills by then you can move on to the far superior harbwhat mechanics no matter what you train this ship is a nightmare to fit out and flylasers and tank on a suicide ship do you even know how to gank people and as for insurence fraud i see you missed tyrannis entirely
you cant even fit 5 heavy pulse lasers on it with all at v before any other mods is this meant to be a damage ship or not
suicide ganking is still insurance fraud  youre claiming insurance for the loss of a ship that was blown up by concord because you broke the rules the omen is an awesome cruiser just the way it is  the omen navy issue even more so i have my rd alts flying them to help me in missions just because the omen is that awesome no ammo reload delays no delay in switching between ammo types a couple of drones to keep you company  what more can a cruiser pilot ask foryou just have to pick carefully between gank or tank
again suicide laser boats also it isnt really fruad they know who blew it up and they still pay you blame game mechanics for your wrongnesscongrats you can afford 100mil to use the only good tech 1 non pirate faction laser boat head to a 10 system and laugh about it oh good you can mission in it there is a huge difference between a pvp armor fit and a pve fit it is great that it can pve but as there only dmg bonused laser boat lets not leave pvp in the coldbeing able to pvp fit it with medium skill for a start let alone fitting it with max skillunlike any other cruiser gotcha
yes omen powergrid and cpu cripple it its however not the end of the world because the faction t2 and t3 alternatives are much much better fixing the omen would be nice but would not bring much to eve unlike other things more important to fixop while youre on a crusade to boosting t1 cruiser try fitting 5x 250mm rails on a moa and see where that leaves you
last time i fit an omen i had no problemsmight wanna show comparable fits that work on other t1 cruisers and not omenalso you keep talking about new people and zero skills fit and then complain that t2 dont fitthis needs a lot more work for now im not convinced

those are terrible omen fits and we shouldnt compare the omen to the rupture as they are different tier cruisers tier system sucks compare it too the caracal stabber and vexor as they are the other damage tier 2 cruisersthat being said i support this change could also do with something similar happening for the caracal so that can fit hams or heavies with a tech 2 fit without loads of fitting mods
you contradict yourself if you dont agree with the way tier system works then you dont use itthen you do compare it with all cruisers personally i think it does suck and it should be compared to 2nd best ship for each race and it is a bit lacking i will do more testing before supporting this
i think you will find the point i was making was that comparing the tier 2 cruiser with a tier 3 cruiser is never going to balance then the part in the brackets was just making the point that i think the tier system sucks that isnt a contradiction thats two separate points there is no point in comparing the rupture and the omen whilst the tier system is still in place once ccp wakes up and gets rid of that then the omen should be balanced against the rupture moa and thorax as they are all the races gun cruisers but as its still there it should be balanced against the stabber vexor and caracal as the combat tier 2 cruisers as much as that sucksedit cleared up the rambling effect to this post mostly
this is a max skill fit with 3 fitting mods to throw it all together the standard max skill rupture fit pushes 24000ehp the vexor 22000ehp and the speed tanking lse stabber 18000ehp and dont need fitting mods at any skill level unlike your fits that need both rig and low slots for fitting mods why dont you reset those skills to engineering 4 electronics 4 and weapons upgrades 4 and see how a tech 1 newbe feels about those fits compared to the well used vexor stabber and caracal fiti agree fully from a combat stand point as long as the teir system is still aroundrupture  omeneven after a fitting friendly omen the rupture will still be king of the hill till blaster rail and maller changes the point is it can be fit easily and as a similar turret boat and it can be used by lower skill playersbut the rupture on any other level is entirely unfareto your final point i agree in spades to the caracal but want the omen done first the blaster moa picks up the slack for now
true blaster moa is at least a decent gun cruiser i want the omen to be able to at least fit the plate and guns with a mwd without need a powergrid rig would mean that i can bring them out on cruiser roamsif eft ehp is anything to go by the 800fmp fitted omen gets just shy of 400dps and 22k ehp so its not too bad on that front but thats with a powergrid rig and having to use nano platings rather than eanmsi would prefer the tier system removed and the cruisers balanced on roles rupturethoraxmoaomen as gun cruisers mallerstabbercaracalvexor as support cruiser antitackle heavy tackle sort of roles
tier system is nontional you are claiming that a higher tier cruiser is always going to be better and yet vexor is aguablythe best cruiser around and it is tier 3 even if you dispute the fact that it is the best cruiser around which you are rightfull to do it is at least no worse then thorax which is a tier two cruiser and its not like maller is good either so yes amarr cruisers are lacking a bit
you have the gallente cruisers the wrong way around the vexor is tier 2 as it requires lvl 2 cruiser where as the thorax is tier 3 and i never said the vexor was a bad cruiser i said the tier system is ed and thats why comparing the omen to the rupture is going to be silly as it is like comparing the stabber to the rupture although i hate it the tier 2 were meant to be worse in fitting that the tier 3 the problem here is that the omen is worse fitting than all the other tier 2 cruisers as wellalso unless you noticed i have supported this and never said the amarr cruisers were good the only one that is good is the arby
supported omen needs a little love
omen needs love and the tier system needs to get removed o
not supportedif you want to be inneficient by studying them your decission
even that i made those skills i think that they should be taken away and basic levels of attributes should be risenthe ones that cannot be remappedthen maybe good solution would be to just remove advanced learning skills and leave only basic oneswhy should they be removed because when you start game and everyone tells you to train learning skills and not to start playing is really annoyingmany people will think why they should play game in which you need to spend first few days just to train learning skillsgame should be fun not hard work and i dont think many people thinks that doing nothing just to profit in future is funsure it is part of this game but it is not really funny to dobut if removed those skill points should be given back in quicker training speed for currentspcutlearningspfor ppl still under 16mln sp just cut their sp by learning skills cut and change bonus boost to 100learningsp16mln1 so they will reach 16mln sp in same time like now it is 16mln 100 boost ofcourse there can be some bonuses for speed just for the thinking of just loosing those learning times in past but it was like it was and if needs changes let it changeand be happy you can just play and not learning pso basically remove learning make stats better and extend bonus boost
just neural remap idk if more things including just cosmetics get pay item only i can see a problem wis is clearly heading in that direction  buy clothing for plex witch i find annoying but could live with it if they somehow make it a bit more challenging like mentioned clothing is available threw the loyaltypoint store and you need lp  plex to redeem i would clearly dislike things like gambling tables to be plex items as i think that would have a noticeable impact likely regarding plex price xd making them tables dam expensive and maybe cosing many to not be able to afford plex for free game time
so no blue posts here and no mentions in dev blogs so far
i like the idea as it brings a more scifi feel to the veins mining idea for the ice i came up with a separate idea which would help the ice miners you can find this idea listed here its a pdf so its not visible in the igbgiven the implementation of both of these i think mining would actually become fun to do and maybe even more profitable supported 1000 times over
can someone weld a snowplow to the front of my exhumer to push all the macros out of the wayin all seriousness id like to see mining become more interactive more profitable an actual career path to follow however before any changes to mining are done i think something has to be done with macrominers they are a diseasei havent commented on the t3 exhumer idea that idea sounds like a good one as well but if put into place im sure macros will exploit that as wellin the systems i mine in i see macros all over they log in and strip belts 237 petitions dont seem to work and gank squads are only an inconvenience sometimes just making them go somewhere else if your idea could be implemented to beat macro software id be all for it
i like the big asteroids mega sized asteroid belt idea i think mining needs some variation at the moment its activate lasers wait between 45 and 180 seconds and repeat i think this as an advanced mining practice would be good as well as break up the bordom factor of doing mining i dont think this idea should replace all mining however i just cant see mr joenoob having the patience to do all this to make such a little amount of isk dont forget mining is one of the easiest ways to make money when your a noobhaving some 3550km radius asteroids in amongst standard asteroids would give new people interested in mining something to aim for remember when you saw people in battleships and you had just gotten into your first cruiser same kinda thing end game for miners atm is the hulk with either a rorqual or orca in support something like a semicapital ship with 1 mega laser to punch a hole through into the good components of the asteroid would be awesome but you would have someone do a scan before hand to give you the best yield there isnt enough actual team work involved in mining if that was addressed somehow in your idea i would support it
this i dont care if this hat is 99 cents and we arent getting microtransactions for things that matter baaaaw plex for remap i dont count it because i can pay for it with ingame currency making actually kinda cool baaaw rich players have an advantage now ever heard of deadspace or officer modulesanyway ops a  nothing else really also 10 mil against it being cromo the grammar doesnt fitedit of course youre going to disagree with me about this but until ccp requires i pay actual money for ingame things and i can only pay with actual money im not gonna be ed
awesome idea we should also make people that live in empire pay an extra 999 a month for concord protection fees and highsec licensing fees you should also have to pay 50 cents for each mission you run to grease the wheels sotospeak of those pesky agents oh lets not forget the 799 hulk fee
the feedback is much appreciated i suppose i need to remind the trolls that this thread is not for them so kindly gtfo and go back to caod

semifinalists are posted and its an absolute disaster we have nearunanimous agreement both in the deviantart comments and on the eve forums that the judges are utterly incompetent the vast majority of the semifinalists are either terrible andor have nothing to do with eve and many excellent and communityfavored submissions were ignoredunfortunately there is one simple cause for this deviantart sucksso ccp should do three things1 rejudge the entire contest throw out the opinions of the deviantart judges and have judges from ccp select a new set of 15 semifinalists as well as the three winners out of the ccpchosen 152 never have anything to do with deviantart again preferably with a public statement of this fact the community is not amused take the hint3 run the contest again on a more respectable cg art site and allow reentry of ships from the current contest this is winwin people who got screwed by deviantart get a second chance and we all get to see a much higher level of qualityeditnew addition from devaintarts apology they have now openly admitted that fitting into the existing eve universe was not a priority in selecting the finalists and insulted the eve community in the processeditthe judging was not anonymousbesides the obvious question of how this influences the legitimacy of the judging process it raises the very serious question of why was deviantart hosting a contest that they were not prepared to run
i fully agree
i could really rant but the bottom line is the site that hosted this contest is not worth me speaking of
what the  was deviantart thinking ccp never ever use them again
well i had a joke in the other thread but no disrespect to anyone who submitted work to this contest semi finalist or not however there were some odd choices there i felt
i fully agree and have already filed a petition to that effect
crossposting from eve generalccp i beg of you take a look at the most popular entries ask yourself how they could choose this over this this one was extremely popular and it didnt even get mentioned minnie pilots were going nuts over thisor this a flying frisbee over this also extremely popular wth gallente fansor this a jovian ship that we cant even use made the semifinals over this this one was almost as popular as the tornado above by caldari pilotsor this honestly wtf over this amarr pilots were going nuts over thiswhat the hell happened there of those finalists maybe one barely or two the only decent evelike semifinalist fit into the eve universe but only barely i mean what the hell is this or thisthis crap is an insult to eve
maybe one of those entries deserved to be a semifinalist at most
disgustedwas noone at da asked to actually play the game before judgingedit 1
damned if they do damned if they dontim quite disappointed there were some seriously awesome designs and i thought even if i dont win well get quality visuals it just didnt happen i understand that not everyone can be pleased but deviantart judges just scored so low
same here
agreed we need to draw ccps attention to this as theres still time to rejudge all the entries come on ccp show us that you care screw any contract you have with da and judge the entries yourselves we wont mind if it takes a year or more to finally see a good ship in game
i can not seriously fking believe iti have been following the ship design contest almost from the start and seen the skill and dedication that some guys have put through this competition and you go and select a load of shti mean how on earth does the la battleshte get in but the tornado does notfully agree with op
i fully support this
supported for an eternity deviantart totally held the idiot ball when choosing
 devfailant art there was so many better ships out there ffs that stratholm caldari bs was perfect just perfect this contest is crap the only thing i could see remotely winning is that little minmatar ship because ccp wouldnt even have to do anything to it its like the contest was rigged not to pick the best looking but the easiest for ccp to manage complete crap
i fully support this
its an absolute disaster deviantart sucks
its a shame they run their contest on deviantart which people not at all in any way related to eve can post their stuff hoping to steal the prices from those who deserve it
narukami cyruk velam the gatekeeper deserve to be semifinalistsa few others were good but not solid shoeins considering other designs that were overlookedand what ing es me offhalf are borderline copyright infringement of preexisting eve ships and one is digital spit in the face of everyone who worked hard to create a solid entry for this contest
i dont see how ccp can suddenly just change the rules in the middle of the competition so let them choose the winners from the finalists like the rules state we also had loads of great contestants so i see the rules being the bigger issue than letting da host it the process of deciding winners was poor not the designs so ill not support points 1 or 2im in full agreement though that ccp shouldnt let those good designs slip through their fingers either do another competition with different selection process or pick extra designs form the contestants that didnt make it to the finals there were some true gems there and they actually looked like eve ships
i support a re judging by ccp themselves theirs is an opinion i atleast trust most of the ships that were selected for semifinalist do not even look like eve ships i would atleast expect the judges to select something that would fit within the universei worked hard to make my own submission follow the design specs that you often find in caldari ships for instance i never expected to be selected as a semifinalist but atleast with ccps own textures and modellers it would atleast look like it was designed by the caldarii truly hope ccp will do the right thing and judge the contest themselves
fully agree
definitely disappointedsupporting this
pretty much sums up my sentiments
agreedit looks like the judges were lazy and picked only entries submitted near the end of the contestthis is the only entry from september
this is one of main reasons i will support this lolwat theres some decent choices cause of innovative ideas but a few poor ones too no disrespect to artists also i really felt this one needed to be in the finals it even offers other race counterpart ideas tornadoedit removed vote reason on page 5
right right 3000 to choose from that is not an easy task but doable
devians dont know the gamethey dont nknow what theyare judgingif you whant anything done right do it yourself
agreed
signed it seems like such a shame to throw away most of the good entries and accept utter edit forgot to thumb
how they ignored the tornado which in just about everyones estimation was a cut above the rest is beyond me
first time ive ever posted in the assembly hall thats how strongly i feel about this signed
agree with everyonethis contest went from promising to absolute mayhem all because deviantart chose the finalistsccp owns the game so they can very easily just ignore the choices deviantart staff made and then create their own top 15and i agree with everyone else in saying that the tornado 
true 3000 is a lot but there was a week for judging and it only takes a second to see if a ship is serious or not i mean when you end up with a finalist called the long ass battlecruiser it shows they dont care that much and hardly put any effort into it
this contest is more of a discrace than my avatar if that was even possible
it cracks me up someone commenting how similar to an actual handdrawn work it appears do they need another wacom tablet nope my handdrawing ass needs a wacom tabletso then i can also stop handdrawing and start creating digital content that appearshanddrawn p
thats exactly what devious beep want  most of the semifinalists are utterly beep pointing to few decent designs all this stuff needs rejudging
da trolled us lol
first time ever posting in the assembly hall i followed the contest almost daily and was really excited to see so many teriffic designs being submitted for considerationfrankly im disgusted by the lack of professionalism demonstrated by the deviantart judges in picking such lackluster and unpopular entries for the finaliststhe popular submissions were popular for a reason i like many others were genuinely excited over the possibility of playing them ingame i hope ccp will listen to the player base and remedy this situation asap
for the love of god ccp rejudge the semifinalists we dont need space donuts and boxes there are a huge number of good choices in this contest
fyi ive posted a more formal petition for the community to officially sign on to over here in the general discussion section
same situation for me mates i didnt even read this section of the forums until now this contest needs rejudged immediately and by nonlazy intelligent real eve players
if they are honest even some of the ones who were selected must be amazed at the ones that have been left outi feel sorry for those that spent hours designing something when it basically looks as though the 15 were selected by drawing random lots from a hat
those finalists are a total fiasco signed
i looked at lots of entries during the contest and with all the nice things i saw i was wondering how could make only 1 winner as tons of the entries are wonderfullbut these judges these semifinalists no seriously theres limit to ty tastes theres 23 intersting the rest is garbageat this point having took random entries as winner may have find better results thats really ridiculous
semifinalist selection is true disaster 
signedtotal travestyif you are a member of deviantart look below the images of the selected submissions and click the link rejector sign up a bunch of alt accounts
i support a complete rejudging from the ccp staff the majority of the finalist represent nothing suitable for inclusion in eve online as stated in the rules
i am adding my voice to the mob da dropped the ball on this they might have found it cute or funny in their choices but in doing so they left out far better designs that not only fit eve but look good while doing iti hope that ccp will step in and do the right thing and pick their own designs or heck better still give the players of eve a chance to vote on a ship since they have a vested interest in game unlike the untrained monkeys at daedit for thumb
from some awesome entries they choose this oh my
please ccp choose your own top 15
full agree
it makes me sad when i see the great submissions that didnt make it
the semifinalist selection is indeed a bit  odd
agreed the choices they made are absolutely abysmal most dont even kind of fly under eve design canon
to say the least
this contest has to be a sham there is no excuse for some of the choices and some of the exclusions no tornado wtf
wtb better judges
yepeach one is fail
saying yes to labattlecruiser is not normalbut on da it is
seriusly thats the worst ing jugdement ever
absolutely supportedhow the hell was this overlookedtornado
the basic estimation that the da judges dont eves best interests at heart it probably resounding loudly here part of the contest rules said that creative presentation of the task was a criteria for judging the semifinalists unfortunately this leads to da choosing more artistic entries than worthwhile ones things that look interesting but hardly a single eve player would give a damn about flying out of the 3000 some entries the semifinalists should be each and every a ship that hordes of players would be chomping on the bit to get their hands on and further ships that the majority of players could actually fly this seemed obvious from the under1000 meters requirement so that no one would be making anything bigger than a battleship sure the jove ship looks fantastic but a contest like this is a reason for the players to get excited about something new to play with not something to sit in the corner and gather just as much dust as had it not been chosen to begin with to say nothing of  like this or this which is designed around a concept that would be impossible to implement in the game thats pretty basic logic to not include winning designs that are not purpose designed for their mediaallinall a failure im glad to see both the eve community and da artists are furious about this
when i checked the semi finalists i didnt expect mine to be with them but some of my favsthe moment i saw them i honestly didnt know what to say it even broke my worst case scenario
i usually stay away from the forums but these results were a disaster i mean seriously the labattlecruiser most of the 15 ships that made the cut dont belong to the eve universe the judging should be done by ccp staff da failed very hard on this one 
complete agreement
agreed the judges choices for the semifinalists were rather poorly chosen
supported
as an impartial observer who did not have a submission in the contest to be passed over by these crap semifinalists i wholeheartedly agree
signed there were much more awesome ships
was severely underwhelmed by the semifinalist designssupported
yeah alot of those semifinalists dont seem very eveesque and some obviously superior designs didnt make it in should be rejudged
supported
im surprised we didnt see the box labeled spaceship in the finalists given the lineup that was chosen
again agree i dont watch much the forum tooi want to state how wedont think its just me people of eve who made entry feelwe spend our time making this ships instead of playingwell at least not hardcore pvp actionp while we where making our work we saw some wonderfull job and we keep doing ours knowing we had to lose to those well fitted for eve shipsthen we saw the finalist and we knew our ship where better than many of those and we fall from the sky how that could happen with such other entryi hope im not too much repetitive but damn i have a devil for every hair i have in my headwell figuratively speaking im bold 
signedthere are 4 ships in the top 15 that are even close to looking like something that might make it into the game the rest are crap no offence to the artists you did well except the la failcruiseralso first time in assembly hall
supported
signedhell this is my first time in assembly hall thats about how strongly i feel about this
 deviantart  its judges and  the semifinalists  every single one is topped in style creativity and technical workmanship by stuff that got passed over ccp should have asked anyone interested to submit designs created a gallery website and included feedback in the judgingi agree with the op entirely though i would add that we should also orbitally ing bombard deviantart its the only wayedit im surprised some of the lol entries didnt get in with judging like this
the deviantart judges needs to be fired then whoever picked them needs to be fired they need to take a good look at what actually exists in eve and make quite a paradigm shift signed
winners when compared to some of the others that were submitted are not on the same level or best express eve ship themesccp should intervene in the best interest of the game
the la battlecruiser voted in and the tornado not getting into finalist is my main reason voting  it shows something went wrong but alot of the other entrys where pretty neat and nice concepts props to the artistsid like to see syndicate soe ammatar intaki  thukker tribe the society faction ships added in one day few of these might make the cut like the japanese styled gallente one as a intaki ship etc
i support this 100
but to pick that one would require knowing what hard points are cant have that can we
i believe i express the sentiment below that many players felt when reading the description of the ships in particular the ones like the bes where the artist who created it clearly has never played eve or if they have theyre an idiot also props to whatever genius threw some rust and cocacola signs on an iteron for getting to the semi finalswhat the duck is this spit
what this guy said
agree
supported and if you have a deviant art account dont forget to go to the semifinalists page and click the reject button under the pile of images
 you da
that there will be people upset with the semis was for sure be it cos their entry wasnt taken be it cos a ship they fell in love with hasent ben taken or be it that one or two semifinalists arent as good as cud have beenbut this is a quite a mess the greatest proportion of those semifinalists arent insertable at all and dont match the rules in more then just tiny issuesok ccp can choose the top 3 out of them and the prize winners wouldnt win completely undeserved but 15 semifinalists and they managed to pick more undeserving entrys then if they had a rolled deice
disgusting
i fully support this
here is what will happen ccp will ignore the plea they will pick the nr 123 from the reasonable to good entries out of the 15 which will probo be the cyruk velam narikamu tsunami gatekeeper or vision will make the ship implement it and all will be forgotten about in a few monthsthere will be no rejudging not now not ever because they would have to come back on their own rules not to mention you have to tell some semifinalists they are not in the 15 afterall not going to happen as much as im disappointed with mostof the last 15 just do like bodycount does
no just pick 15 more then select the winners from all 30 that is 750 more in prizes but that is a damn cheap marketing campaign for that price
signed the contest finalists for the most part did not adhere to the existing styles of eve nor were original enough to be suitable finalists da judging has failed and want the entries to be judged properly by ccp itself
ok then if we all feel the same way on this sod the choices made alrdy lets vote you make eve not ccp folksthe tsunami gets my vote for sure peace n love to u and urs folks  and pain to ya clones
signed
i havent posted in the assembly hall at all before i havent even posted much on the forums themselves but the results of this contest are as said before underwhelming a few of them fit but the rest should not have won over most of the other submissions yeah im looking at you la battlecruiser 
support
totally agree i mean wow one of them is just what looks like a block of wood drawn on some paper and that somehow got into the top 15 really
deviantart downs syndrome judges trolling ccp cdi hope that line drawing ruler thing wins just so that theres no doubt in anyones mind that the whole thing is a giant troll

there are people getting banned and not resciving proper explainations you hear people get banned cause of false petitons or ccp do mistakes or just reasonsbut when they have to use days just to find out why they got banned it screws up ppls game and prologn the time before ccp can rectyfy their wrong doingsi propose ccp should send documentation on why ppl get banned not just a general message about ppl breaking eula
its been boring and its been boring because the enemy refused to fight while that is their right i think conquer should be easier when the defender doesnt try to fight or delay youtldr what i propose is a mechanics that makes conquering a system harder than it is today if there is enemy presence but makes it straightforward if they fail to show upbasically the idea is to have resistances on every structure from pos to ihub that depend on the owners presence not really a lot but some presenceevery ship present in space and outside of a pos would add some points to the resistances up to for example 80 they could stack so even if you have a thousand ships nominal maximum resistance would never be reached at this resistance level structures should have around three times the efective hitpoints that they have today the base hitpoints with zero presence should be in the range of a fith of nowadays efective hitpoints suggested numberscapital 10bs 5cruiser 3frigate 1to reduce lag this should be checked every x minutesthis way the defender can make life difficult for the attacker even with a fleet of 50 cloaky frigates the attacker will have the option to chase the enemy fleet to reduce the resistance work for the support fleetlarge fleet battles or move to another system or simultaneous attacks a staticabsent defence will no longer be usefulas a consecuence of this mechanics defending one or to systems will also be easier that it is today allowing for strongholds opportunity for small alliances and heroic last stand at the same time defending large areas of space and scattered systems will be more difficult than todayit would also add a role for small gang harassing because you can have several of this gangs reinforcing undefended structures in enemy territory preparing the ground for the large fleet to come and finish them even for black ops operations to compensate for this and avoid spending heaps of time repairing structures all over your dominions automatic refill of the shields should take place in no more than a few hours after finishing reinforce modean alternative to the system would be to do it gridlinked so we would get intrasystem movility and force battle if you want to dend your assets with the fleets jumping from structure to structure in this versiUFFFDn only visible ships outside the pos would count i dont really like this idea because then there is no benefit to small alliancesfinally i see a problem with big capital fleets jumping from system to system destroying structures before the defender can react despite the fuel problem that would mean i think that a counter is needed something like a 100 resistance for 5 minutes UFFFDburning strontium before damage is done could workthx for reading
i like this
so with a few caps that every corp can get together you can get it to the max percentage while being invulnerable since they are cloaked
ilike the general direction of thisbut i think thatwe should not conunt cloackiesand i would like more then just resistace increase a small systemi support the general motion
yes thats correct but you will better have a few caps on every system you own or the attacking fleet will just go to the nearest empty system you can then jump there they will move to a couple of different systems and so onan even if you are there cloaked it would only take a fleet a couple of hours to destroy your assets if your ships simply stay there it only takes more time than now because you can never get more that 80 resistanceprotecting a system will be easy protecting a hole region will not be and the main purpose if you are not there it will fall very quickly
the only reason for this cloackies is to allow small alliances to make it tough to take their systems hoping that the big guys will leave them alone because its not worth the effort this will probably be true if tens of new settlers come to 00i hope that this together with the increased vulnerability of extended dominions will make it easier for them to get into 00 without the big ones killing them instantly just for funand what other things are you thinking about
supportedthe llente navy ships in particular are terribadif you wanted a camo effect you could have at least researched something like ww2 dazzle or something else that has a marginally scifi pedigree think chris fosstheyre embarassing lazy and unacceptable in a game that prides itself on visualsfix them then stop
the goal of this proposal is not to provide the ultimate fix the goal is to compile all mororless valid options to improve hybrid turrets this propsal however only touches on the guns alone there is a number of issues with ships themselves ad i will not touch upon those as they are outside of scope of this proposal please reply with numbers of improvements that you would like to see implemented and constructive criticism generally a combination of these improvements would bring hybrids to a level where they can adequately compete with other guns this proposal assumes that hybrids are weedyi did not incude any ideas that make role of hybrids overlap with other weapons ie increasing range i want to keep them different but not inferior 1 tracking improvement this mainly goes for blasters their current range is about half that of autocannons depends on exact ammunition type yet they have the same tracking as the range decreases tracking requred to hit the target increases exponentally theirfore i think that tracking of blaster should be improved 2 more damage fairly straightforward there is an opinion that if blasters have three times shorter range then lasers do they hould have enough damage to compesate this disadvantage and currently they do not 3 faster reload times this would put hybrids in a position where they have advantage over a ship with projectiles because they can switch ammunition quickly according to what they need i am not talcking about instantaneous switching like laser have but replacing 10 seconds with 5 seconds lets say 4 smaller ammunition size  since hybrid turrets have to provide energy to the projectile and that energy is taken from the ships energy systems and not stored chemically in the projectile the ammunition should be smaller in size when compared to that of projectiles as velosity of hybridfired projectiles is significantly greater that that of any artillery shells the projectiles are smaller the calliber size is smaller eg 425mm against 1400mm for artillery shells the size of hybrid ammunition should be significantly reduced 5 less capacitor usage  straight forward6 annihilative damage  this could be an alternative to damage buff part of he damage would come in a separate damage type annihilative this damage type would ignore resistances of the ship and deal full damage at all times assuming that the gun did not miss only small portion of damage would come in annihilative form and it would only exist for certain ammunition types antimatter javelin void void would have the largest portion of annihilative matter roleplay reason antimatter annihilates any normal matter without consideration for weather it is glass or tungsten carbide make your choices
you forgot about the alpha on a railguns and the fact that middle range ammo is almost useless ammo is the main issue in both  blasters and railguns groups the best solution i see is to decrease rof with the range instead of damage mod that will make rails more usefull both at close and long range and blasters alpha can be limited on a close range
alright i can add alpha but i am really against cuttingrange because their range only exceeds that of lasers by a couple kilometers if you cut that you get a weapon tat does less dps less alpha and worse tracking and would ultimately make them obsolete the only thing that saves rails at this point is their insane range
it is super easy to fix railguns right now now they have almost same damage as artillery and artillery clearly wins due to wtf volley damage selection and no cap usage while rails eat as much cap as 10 cap usage bonused lasersjust decrease railgun rof and give it more damage their dps should be between beam and artilleryafter this simple fix all long range guns will be balanced lasers most damagetracking railguns best rangeaverage trackingaverage dpsaverage alpha projectiles best volleydamage selectinstill nice dpsno cap usageabout blasters im not sure really they clearly need some love but its so easy to break things in eve
quit trying to balance guns by adding more damage ffs im so tired of this argument every boost to a guns damage affect so much more in this game including the need for hp rebalancei still completely hate the rebalance to projectiles bc theyre so ing overpowered now sadly nobody realizes this bc the zealot army and the drake blobs are winning eve atm
im fine with the damage boost eve is tediously overtanked as it isbut the problem isnt blaster damage its that blaster ships are too slow and heavy to make it into range and just get kited by anything with a shield tank the only people that would benefit from a flat dps boost to blasters would be empire station campers
hey guys i support a rebalance to hybrids but not this way im just spitballing here but what if the gallente race and minmatar race just switched play styles minmatar would get close range wtf damage that would compliment their speed they would keep their shield mostly tanks however and gallente would get artys and auto cannons to allow them to actually compete with the rest of eve i fit autocannons on my myrm and ishtar now anyway it would be a big overhaul but aside from completely redesigning hybrids its the only thing i could see that would make most people happy i would love to have a vaga with neutrons wouldnt you
since the sole purpose of guns is to deal damage your argument is equivalent toquit trying to balance anything by making it more usefulwhat do yo mean not this way i offered you six options and you dont like any of them and switching play stiles would actually work i think but would be too big of a change
1 tracking is good but doesnt solve the issue the last time blasters were good was before the web nerf even after that their only advantage was atleast we arent projectiles if the goal is to compensate for targeted ships beating tracking at blaster optimal then yes this will work it wont however solve the getting in range portion of the issue that webs also fixed2 more damage on the weapon system with the most damage i dont think anyone would scoff at having more damage the problem is the application thereof more damage would help compensate for falloff but the goal in the end is to get to optimal anyway this doesnt fix the problem3 faster reload times arent terribly useful because by the time you need to reload the battle is over either youve died or they have ive almost never run out of ammo midfight with a blasterrail ship so its sorta a moot issue now if instead this is a fix to the range issue ie being able to quickly swap from long range to shorter range ammo as you get closer thatd work but youd still need the instaswap of lasers to be efficient4 smaller ammo is what the projectile problem was a few years back acs had such a high refire rate that you needed to carry an ton of ammo for drawn out battles again there isnt that much of a problem of running out of ammo in a fight and you can already carry a sizeable amount so this isnt a good fix either5 less capacitor usage is nice but its not as useful when the typical blaster ship has boosters and no active tank the natural passive recharge with max skills more than covers your cap usage unlike with laser ships6 annihilative damage while sexy sounding kinda goes against the whole eve concept this also harks back to the more damage issue which also wont solve the problempersonally i had thought that adding a web effect to blasters would be kinda useful it could help counter enemy movement and make up for the lack of the 90 webs the ships used to enjoy a more serious suggestion would be to make them the alphakings of close range fighting boost their damage and drop their rof so they can get crazy massive singlehits doesnt help with the killmail whoring but you can bring the hurt much more immediately once you do get into range and hopefully before you dieso what are the serious deficiencies of blaster ships range and tracking why not fix the ships as suggested above armor buffer is inversely perportional to a ships ability to maneuver and maintain combat range boosting energized regenerative plating might be a solution but then youd have armor ships zooming around with relatively low signatures and completely eliminate shields from pvp you can boost the agility of blaster ships but that doesnt help with ships that can still outshoot you while you cover the distance and you begin to encroach on minmatar territoryi think the real problem is that of bonuses ships that are blaster ships have have an active tank bonus brutix hyperion astarte or can have a falloff bonus deimos catalyst atron incursus astarte again currently active tanks are worthless and a falloff bonus on the alreadyshortfalloff blasters doesnt help all that much i dont know what to suggest for these ships but certainly some other bonus would be much more useful sig radiuscapacitor of mwds perhaps
bump
i support this fully haveing a fixed point to base your flight off would help in a number of ships fast and slow
call it galactic north if you need an rp reason for it and say its towards the center of the cluster or some crap but yes this would be nice
my idea is to see if we can have ccp add an ingame bug report feature most games already have this type of feature also maybe add an ingame option for feedback the idea is to remove the requirement of logging into the forums to submit things personally going through all the hoops to submit a bug has prevented me from doing so a quick button near the petitioning system would fix that i would want the feature to be open help click button marked report bug then a window opens that you can directly write into submit quick and simple and maybe something just as simple for feedback
i think it is even worse than the current system so i hijack this topic with someone elses idea just like you did unless you are quesa i personally would also make changes to that idea but i cant be bothered to think too long about that now for example imo there should be an off switch that allows you to use a system but not start claiming sov in it aditionally i also see some other problems but in the end it is just the general direction sov should be going into imo
as if it wasnt insulting enough that you made this proposal look horribly incomplete you didnt even change the wording from my own proposal being discussed on other forumsplagiarism is bad
what are you on about there is no such thing nothing like this exist buddy trust me you are just simply mad because i released my ideas on the forums before i dont know what you have in your head before you could vomit your out here
not supporting a chromo effect thread
as per the new dev blog profiles will after a grace period default to being public to everyone this should default to private insteadpros noone will have their profiles set to public without them realizingcons none 
the public setting means that eve gate will show the same information to the world that it would show to any random trial account anyway it should be public and the private setting doesnt make any senseit doesnt improve your privacy the only information not available via api directly is bio and employment history and those could be spidered easily via trial accounts remember we are talking about publishing bio and employment history only the rest is available easily via other means
1after few months realising that everyone can your buddy list isuncomfortableedit typo
dude thats no devblog your linking toalso nothing related to profiles on evegate either
my bad fixed the link
after the trinity patch the recoileffects of the turrets where gonewill we get them backor is it not possible with the new grafic enginei allready asked in the eveger forum and they also want it back greetz stennar
10
every device in the game has a counterguns vs armorshieldsecm vs eccmdamps vs boostersprobes vs cloaksworking as intendedthread
pretty sure they can already fit both
they can fit both only no space for others drones then left that is on hell and wyvern iirc simple solution is leaving two fighters at home and you got enough space nerf other scs to the same level or nerf them all further tbh and you start getting a more reasonable ship but my megathron also cant switch from large to med to small blasters depending on what it needs while getting a bonus to all of them let scs make a choice which drones they want to carry
still nothing planned 
were working on the csm mini summit reports at the momentid expect proposals to appear just before the weekend
ill be bringing up 2 topics at leastbooster revamp and wrecking outposts ill formally request for them to be put on the agenda when i finish writing their wiki pages
nice one for the station wrecking addition
how did you lose a dramiel to a badger
lol you read shc
i know the best solution for the blaster problem learn other weapon type it is common now to fit ac on myrm or ishtarps 23h 7m left large energy turret v yeeeehaaa
as i have said earlier in this post the best fix would be to play around with the ammo not so much the guns why well hybrids are a mix of laser and projectile weapons however they have all the drawbacks of both and very few advantagesalso turrets are a constant they have fixed attributes these attributes are slightly modified by character skill they are also heavily modified by ship bonuses however these bonuses are very static and bind ships to certain rolesnow ammo is the variable in the turrets performance however the current state of hybrid ammo is very unilateral the only two weapon attributes ammo currently effects are range with damage and cap use projectile ammo gets selectable damage type range  damage and tracking enhancing ammo why not use the ammo to create vastly different weapon attributes for exampleone ammo type could effect alpha strike massive damage but very slow rate of fireone ammo type could effect tracking low damage with high trackingone ammo type could effect optimal and another falloffalong with range and capacitor usage stats there are also the base shield and base armour damage stats one high damage close range ammo could specialise in very high shield damage with very low armour damage and vice versathis will make all the middle ammo types have a purpose too
should as a player i see a difference between the mwd and afterburner icons so that i can tell the differenceits implemented on sisi mwd now have a glow around the sprite and they can be easily distinguished
delicious keystroke greatnessi can has
saving multiple keep at range distances that are useful would be really helpful more customization
sounds good to me
ops idea gets my support
sounds pretty coolsupported
i support this i am caldari and only having a bonus to kinetic damage is retarted
omen needs the grid to fit 800mm plate mwd and focused medium pulse iis according to my eft with maxed out skills thats a 5 pg boost and to accomodate for lower skilled players somewhere more around 1015 would probably be in orderand then youve got cpu issues to deal with
now i support this guys idea
there is nothing wrong with the idea and i see no problem with small amounts that reward long term players 1mil sp per year remap for each year account has been active paid months would be fair i think so if you started in 2003 and have not stopped paying since the first month you would get a 7mil sp remap  so for even max chars ingame since the start they dont even get 6 months of training back i really dont see how anyone could see it as a problem tbh id be happy if they did it as a once only thing or even did it only every 34 yearslets face it i studied italian irl in school 7 years agohow much of it do i remember nothing lol
strongly support learnings are an anachronism that should go
supported this is my 2nd char in eve after a looong break so its stuck in a station doing learning and cybernetics skills for 3 weeksthanks
simply wtf ccp
i dont know
fully supported this will help stop macros and make mining more fun also that geo orbit might make trageting miners more fun toedit ok that pos idea is awsome
sounds like an excellent idea supported
i dunno this sounds an awful lot like pi to mealso i like that belts have lots of asteroids  thats how asteroid belts are in space having a giant nonplanet ball of minerals isnt very spacerealistici think ccp can and should crack down on macro miners and macro ratters so points for thinking about the problem but i dont like the elimination of belts and of mining crystals for specific types of asteroid
ccp havent iterated on sovereignty since the latest version came out and it still needs a lot of work so please post here if you want to tell ccp that whatever sov system youre in favor of you want ccp to look at sovereignty again and get it fixededit i am trying to deliberately make this proposal blind to any particular detailed sov proposal there are way too many out there at the moment to endorse one without compromising the overall most important message that ccp need to look at sov in the first place
1perhaps this one
there is already a thread in assembly hall on a sov revamp here
yea only your idea for sov is just as terrible as the one we have in placealso your asking for an actual set of changes that you personally came up with something that is never actually going to happensee ccp have people they pay to come up with stuff they dont actually need or want your personal ideas past sov needs work they dont want your 250 word nerd essay just a gentle nudge as they have their own balancing think tank that will come up with the actual change themselvesto top it off in your total ignorance of how the actual process works your insulting the one person who is properly phrasing the topic to ccp in a way that they care aboutunless you can name any single idea in the ah that was installed exactly as some half wit player had envisionedoh no you canthmm perhaps the proper structure is just too much for you to cope withedit dear god the other guys thread is a hit point increase proposal jesus what is wrong with you people

yes please
i am trying to deliberately make this proposal blind to any particular detailed sov proposal there are way too many out there at the moment to endorse one without compromising the overall most important message that ccp need to look at sov in the first place
oh god please
oh god yes please fix this 
yes is no fun
sov needs to be worked on thats for sure
1 for ccp doing some work on the sov system
chewing sov structures is impossible for a small fleet to do in a reasonable amount of time now1 for sov getting a workover
you can thank the csm for the system we have now they were directly involved and gave the current system the seal of approval now you want them to have another shot at it get a clue little girl
i think its definitely time for a another visit of the sov system
word
ccp stated that they wanted to give some weight to small gangs in 00 warfare they implemented dominion for oh waisomethings wrong here 
if you cant even get weights and currencies right then why would anyone agree with you at all i sure as hell dont carry 50 lbs around in my wallet
horrible horrible ideathat would be like wow charging players to use topend gearthe op is bad and they should feel badabsolutley not supported
maybe he means the price divided by the base rate of the ship per month for a chimera at 1188 billion kg thats something like 1909e9 per month so my first penny is collected 4365287238 years from now i guess that penny is ok because by then at 15 a month ill have paid 78575 million in sub fees per toonoh and miriam 50 pounds in stripper singles is 22680 rounded up to the nearest integer someone never needs to leave the tittibar again
i cant stop laughing at this idea muhahahaha
i am disappoint very disappoint ccpdestroy deviantart
ok when i read this i tough naaahh it cannot be that bad people are surely overrreactingthen i opened the links and wtffor god sake no one but a group of peopel trying to sabotage eve would have selected all those pieces of garbage
making my first post ever on the forums to support thisseriously wtf da
tsunami and tsunami certainly first one is more qualifying for semifinal than second one aha thats all setup same case for labattlecruser which is rebrended damascot only reason its being fawed and not that crap from semifinals
what this guy saidmy sentiments exactly
they changed it
no wonder i wqas so confusedthe tornado is now in there gods i wanna fly that
i never  at things because i fell that there are good reason for thingseven though i knew i was not going to win i still submitted 3 entriesbut come onthis contest should be reevaluated by either ccp or the eve communitythere are no reasons as to why the la should be therei personally do not think the judge looked at all the shipsi would like to see the score of all shipsguin
this is like picking dog show judges to pick the winners of a rosegrowing contestseriouslythis is an abomination whatever ship makes it into the game i will be tempted to personally pop every time i see one outside of highsec especially if its the la battleship or whatever thatpaper airplane is
they apologized
well  they rationalized
touche
that wasnt an apology it was an excuse
channel available to discuss this epic failjoin create a ship petition
ill remove my vote think its good enough for me there where a few better choices but overall its a good line up with the narukami  tornado in there and the lolwat one removed edit most of the better designs seemed the same kinda ships we already have
thisthey only addressed the one most obvious screwup and only because it had the artists signature in violation of the rules not because it was a poor design and completely ignored the fact that well over half of the 15 finalists are in no way related to eve
well its jsut a way to allow to give the prize to the tornado and it does deserve it because anything else would just continue the rage on the comunity
raeg
fck da and do it yourself ccp we at least trust your art team with that muchfix trails and cyno lol
as one of the reknowned shipwrights in the game im clearly upset that superior talents of fellow shipwrights where not even considered

ive had an account with da longer than ive had one in eve but i stand with the rest of the eve universe in supporting that ccp make their own decisions as to the worthy designs in this contest deviantart has chosen poorlyin some of the cases at least
in their own words they admit that fitting into the existing world of eve was not a priority
signed
what a shame
leave us alone just leave us alone derp
signedadvertising iteron in my evethis must be dealt with by ccp
for once i agree with merin
judges
no i cannot support this the rules were posted the submissions made the judging done just because you or your frineds ship didnt get chosen is no reason to throw a temper tantrumi like some of the designs chosen i dislike others i also like a few that were not chosen and dislike some of the ones not chosen including a fair few the community seems to have likedeither way it is done time to move on
yeah the rules where postedto bad the da staff didnt follow themand the majority is mad not becaus the ship of a friend didnt get chosen but that most of the semi finalist where subpar to other designs and didnt even follow the rules and aims of the contest and to make matters worse the da staff defended the exluding of the better ships by refering to rules several of the semi ships also didnt followthere no logic to it either the da staff was baked of their ass or we are talking rigging of the results the grose disrespect and neglect of their own rules their insults go take your troll and head to a pregnant teenager forum instead
exactly my own thoughtswhy do you  ccp  let someone else who does not play the game to judge on your and our future ships 
yes they are several of the most vocal posters here and on the da board are entrants into the contest others are climbing on the bandwagon because a design they personally liked didnt get chosen ahead of a design they personally didnt likethat is the nature of a contest a few entrants will win most entrants will loose now ccp will have the final say
you assume muchto my knowledge im not acquainted with any of the people who entered the contestit does not take personal ties to be enraged that this would make it to the top 15 in a contest brimming with talented entries
it is not in the top 15
yes it wasit was in the initial top 15 until the community outrage blared out in the end it was swapped out for a community favorite the tornado when it was pointed out that it had a water mark in the lower right  a blatant rules violation
signed
that is the nature of a fair and honest contest and this one is nothing like that and of course the ones voicing their concern are entrants into the contest its major humiliation to see that subpar ships are choosen over superior designs most of the contestants are ok with being beaten by a superior oponent but to lose becaus someone is trowing a fit and doing what they like with the results giving it away to designs that would have a rough time against some of the excluded ones is humiliating and insulting these people voice their concern becaus its a direct attack against them the players of eve and generaly becaus people do not like injustice some of the designs are awsome but then again some shouldnt be among the semi finalists and the people thats jumping on the bandwagon can be explained with this too quote edmond burke all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothingim not saying da is evil but this also applies to injustice
yes it wasno it is not it does not matter that it might have been at one time or why it is not there now it is not on the list that will be submitted to ccp for judging so all the angst and drama over why it might have been included is now moot
and to want ccp to step in is also a grave injustice
no it is not it does not matter that it might have been at one time or why it is not there now it is not on the list that will be submitted to ccp for judging so all the angst and drama over why it might have been included is now mootsomewhere on this forum was posted earlier is a quote by one of the da judges stating the la battlecruiser was nr 15 and that the tornado was nr 16 if you compare those designs its pretty hard to belive becaus if the tornado was nr 16 it means it wasnt disqualified and if it wasnt disqualified the da team saw it as subpar to all the other semifinalists and thats even harder to belivenow what is easy to belive is that they freaked out due to the major collective outburst at the ridicule of the la battlecruiser as a semifinalist and swapped it with the tornade a favorit to save face this is cause for great concern since they first let trough an entry that was obviusly breaking the rules but that also wasnt as good as many other designs it was unoriginal it already recembles the catalyst destroyer and no major artistic skills or effort looked to have gone into the creation of it to sum it up theres is ground for concern at the judges skills and credebilityedit sorry for the my bad english
oh it certainly does matter because it means the da judging process decided that this unimaginative rulesbreaking entrant was of such merit that it was to be in the top 15 of all the entriesthis calls into question the da judging processmany members of both the da and eve communities have called for more transparency in the judges selection and scoring an explanation of how la battlecruiser got into the top 15 is at the very least owed to the many artists who actually put research time creativity and effort into making an aesthetically pleasing ship that would mesh seamlessly into eves artistry
my apologies i read the rules and didnt notice that partmy impression was that the contest was not that specific i didnt realize that a seamless mesh and pleasing aesthetics was requiredi noticed some entries had a lot of detail even extending to slots pg bonuses etc etci didnt realize ccp was looking for complete seamlessly artistic ships to place in game i thought they were looking for a design that they  ccp  could adapt and place into the game at some point perhaps at a size or in a role or with some different details not envisaged by the original artist
bloody oath this is just shambles also remember to tick support guys
oh man wtf is this
ccp should pick the top 3 from those semifinalists and give them the material prizes but since its their game they should choose the ship to be included in the game from all the entries submitted at least then i wouldnt have to fly with some pos design that the da judges picked
facepalm
signedfolks from devianart have no idea about eve universe
i think it is bull that they picked 15 and then because of cry babies remove one and replace it the guy made it to the semifinals and you troll him out just because you dont like it does not disqualify the fact he won
word ccp should have been judging the contest entries not deviantart
i think ccp should just completely ignore das semifinalists and create their own top15then have a poll on the eveo website about what ship people wants the most
that submission was removed because it broke the rules which is astounding that the judges didnt catch that before picked as a semifinalist
signed
1rejudge the contest try to get some ships that actually fit in eve
design 101 you are making something for a client who will have certain expectations for you to design within in this case a universe that your ship must fit in and almost all of these failed terribly yet were chosen over entries that were far superior screw da
supported
it seems your lights are on but no ones home
the finalists are mostly dumbpeople have linked awesomelooking ships that actually looked like a races style that didnt make it to the top 15 yet random crap that would be mistaken for existing ships did make itthrow it out make a poll website where people can browse ships and vote with their active eve online account once per ip address on which 15 they like the bestthen boom there you have it ships that people will like more often than notbut this da contest is just junk
oh dear
thissigned to the topic
personally i have to agree ccp should redo the judging themselves just the inclusion of the la battlecrapper makes me think there has to be far better ones out there that have been looked over and would fit into our universe or even be seriously better in an artistart critics point of view them putting the tornado even though i think its a sexy shipin place of the la battlecruiser while admirable just doesnt cut itdeviantart dropped the ball on this one and while their efforts were admirable its time to pass the judging back into the hands of ccp
this deviantartcontest sucks ccp show us you can make it betteri fully agree please rejudge the contest
i am in the same situation please rejudge this ccp these entries are terribledoes eve really need a minmatar iteron v or a flying ruler what happened to all the great designs we were drooling over the stahlvogel the tornado the aquilonedited to add support dont forget to support this topic
supported
well the stahlvogel and a number of other great entries got dqd because they had shading on the lineart apparently shading counts as color in the judges viewthe tornado made it in as we all know and are quite pleased aboutand the aquilon well no fing clue why that one didnt make it its lineart was all grey and black it looked perfectly gallente and the art was great no reason it shouldnt have been chosen same thing with the horus quite simply da screwed up badly but in many art contests and not just on da ive noticed that judges will often do pity nominations where obviously bad art gets chosen to bolster the hopes and dreams of aspiring andor crappy artists
agree
agreed
that is an absolute insult to the eve community  deviantart obvious feels they are elite amazing artists with a better opinion on what looks good and are telling eve players to stfu well deviantart can suck it the eve community isnt taking that crap we have way more talented people than deviantart will ever have deviantart people are basically telling us to take the crap art they feel is best and put it in our game forcibly well screw them and their taste in art sucks even if they know nothing about eve they are obviously giving a lame excuse for the horrible crap that unfolded with this contest somebody made a mistake how else would a ship like la battlecruiser make the top 15 or the donut ship and many others all chosen over much better entries made earlier in the contest its very obvious that whoever chose these simply skimmmed off the top of the newest entries and chose at almost random for a top15 a top 15 is not a random most recent 15 i could easily write many walls of text giving the most profane and vulgar hateful words to deviantart but im afraid if i do ill get banned from the forums so im really holding myself back here theres so much i want to say about deviantart and how much they suck you have no idea ahhggg
elitist s ive always said it about da in the past and im sticking with it 1
please let the contest be reviewd by judges that actually play eve i dont need some 14y old that knows how to use photoshop tell me how the elitesuperartists from deviantard know whats right for the game i love unless they blow phreeze

woo hoo rage
just lol
1 ccp definitely need to repick the finalists
supporteddas atrocious attempts at damage control by their community rep which basically amounts to i dont know anything about it stop being big meanies to us dont help either
1and include not only the shiny ones but conceptual
a boring choice of semifinalists noone of of my favorite works are therewell 1 but its also boring to wait for another contest anyway
deviantarts apology is an insult i agree with the proposed action we should never have anything to do with da again
ccp needs to rejudge this whole damn contest
there are some fine choices in the finalists but at the same time so many even better choices were left overlooked too bad aquilon isnt there
even if they cant force deviantart to rejudge which they should they should judge independently about what ship to add to the game because of the current lineup the tornado will likely smoke the competition a sad state for the entries that could have given it a run for its moneypersonally id love to see ccp pick their own semifinalists and put a poll on the forum and ask the players which ship they want the most
supported  some of the entries were craptastic unoriginal not useful advertising ship wtf and just plain stupidand the apology was purely telling us that we should shut up and accept they know bettertell da where to shove their judges if they allow some rulebreakers but disqualify excellent artists on a whim  if they have no taste for what makes good eve ships and if they have no taste in general
wowi am in my final year of a games modelling degree at university i really wanted to enter the competition but due to mainly a lack of spare time but also the amount of awesome designs already submitted i decided i wouldnt be able to spare the time to create and enter something credibleduring the first stage there were heaps of designs that i immediately thought they would give anything i could produce a run for its money and better however after seeing the semifinalistboy was i shocked i see 2 maybe 3 designs that i would say are realistic contenders in comparison to other entriesi feel bad for some of the contenders that clearly spent more time effort and skill on their entries than some of the semifinalistpoor form da
definitely disappointedsupporting this
i ve been in the cg scene for like 15 years and deviantart is of the worse comunities along with many other poser sites it must be done again ps i have not entered my ship because of devianart
i have been on deviantart for longer than in eve and this has been a major letdown they turned a great concept and amazing community response into one big joke
i want that flying frisbee thing looks a lot like the orii battlehip from stargate sg1
agree
i am disappointed with the choices as well
posting here to echo the sentiments  poor choices on most entries i liked 23 but there were too many mediocre ones that didnt deserve their place in semifinals ccp choose your own semifinalists do not honor the choices devianart has chosen for us
i am quite disappointed too some are the choices i expected to see selected but a lot not really not that i am mad or whatever not to have been selected i was prepared to that and did it mostly for the experience and it was a great one especially as i think some designs deserved way better than mine and were not selected either except one or two i was watching carefullyit is always difficult to criticize and speak about that when you actually are part of the contest and lost but i have to support this petition though as an artist myself the semi finals choice makes little sense for me
agree
tornado makes me want to fly minmatar i fly everything but minmatar thusfarby contrast la battlecruiser and okhos battleship make me glad that for the most part theyll be distance blipsdeviant art was the right place to post the contest the wrong place to decide what from the contest was good and fit into the eve universe as its abundantly clear that some of them dont know a thing about eve and have no real care for the end product of this  a ship roughly like the winners goes into eve  vs the prizes
1and 1 again
so many good entries overlooked
1stahlvogel where are you
spinemounted railgun in my eve imho the stahlvogel looks like it belongs in fusion 2097 not eve onlinethe contest had rules many of the good entries didnt follow them for example take the sandstorm minmatar battlecruiser  it has the required views but theyre all done with shaded models not line art as per the rulesat the very least the judging panel should have been joint between da staff and eve online art department and perhaps the eve community should have been more involved at the beginning of the process by commenting on the ships they likedthere is always the possibility of the eve community viewing the entries and picking our own list of what is good what is funny as a minmatar pilot im saddened that noone submitted an office chair with uzi machine guns what is bad and what is terriblethe people that did comment on the contest have been extremely poorly behaved  there are rules on the da site about being polite even if you dont agree with someone i suspect that the behaviour of the eve community has left a very bad impression on all the da folks who participated in the competition regardless of the judgingthe final 15 do show that the da community has a very different idea of what a spaceship looks like than the eve community does some of them would be best described as rocket planes not spaceships i think the da community needs to go pull out a few dozen issues of analog to get some inspiration look at the bes for example  a very creative design complies with the contest conditions is very eveish in its appearance but relies on using line of sight to protect the ship inside its dry dock everyone knows that weapons dont use line of sight what was the guy thinking at least the design showed some originalityfwiw i can see the merits of the current pick of semifinalists  but the judging was about compliance with the rules and artistic merit i agree with the sentiment that the precursorprecursor mk 2 should have made it into the finalists list perhaps ccp could approach that artist independently
i wondered at first why you thought that ship you linked was a good submission because it honestly sucks then i read the rest of your post and realized you were an idiot
10
in supportprobably because i lost but mostly because i dont really like any of the entries
simple solution redo the contest from the start with one more rule you must be an eve member to submit a shipotherwise fire deviantart and rejudge with ccp judges or the community from the beginning
without consider eve integration or not some of the entries who was selected are a epic joke to be in the top 15  in regards of some awsome jobs posted in the contest   no need to link some of them i m sure everybody here could find better eligible submission  6views1 anothersome of those top 15 pics looked to be choosen too quickly by judge or if not those judge needs to change job quickly tooit s just my modeler 3d  graphic professional impress on this da failling
im not sure about this i kinda agree that its ew since it shuts down your ability to do damageremote rep but at the same time its damage too since it shuts down your tank i think your comparsion to dampsecm etc is valid but so is comparing it to gunsmissilesmaybe a compromise with neuts having a reduced effect

thanks for the input so far folks hoping to get this on the calendar for this weekends meetingoops did i accidentally bump the thread how clumsy of me
well if you look at current fleet setups fielded all around eve you will notice the total superiority of drakespams fleets consisting of hundrets of drakes are far to commmon where are all the other shiptypes why is subcap warfare currently dominated by drakesis it the huge resistancebonus the great range of heavy missiles the selection of dmg types the price the behavior of missiles in high lag situations the speed or agilitywhy is the drake preferred over nearly any other shiptype the drake itself nor the missiles havnt changed for years what is the factor making all the other ships obsolete or less attractive i think never before a subcap has dominated fleetwarfare like it currently happening with the drakedo you think ccp should look into this issue then plz give support to this thread why do you think is it like it ist
this is where i knew this was a troll100 drakes arent any better than 100 zealots and 100 of anything combat wise is going to cause damage
we really dont need more than one thread on the topic follow up hereand to the op you have no clue or are trying to troll both is bad
does not look like a troll its a fact drakes are fotmdrakes are handsome ships i think the 80k ehp and the high dps  75km are the reason also you dont run into tracking problems heavy missiles apply their dmg to everythingif you fly a shield tanked snipezealot you have far less ehp and all the issues connected with tracking etc a zealot will do less dmg  70km as well even if you max out an armor tanked zealot you wont beat the ehp a drake has also by increasing your tank you gimp your guns drake is just better more ehplike a battleship tank and dmg are on different slots so you can max out your shield tank and your dmg at once agility you can devote 12 lowslot to fit nanos or odsdrakes can be quite agileat least compared to bs with similar ehp and long range dps
read post 25 in the linked thread about dps advantage of the drake and as a lr hac pilot i would worry more about pulse apocs tbh those are also fotm
you put 100 drakes up against 100 harbingers or 100 hurricanes chances are the drakes will win 90 of the time by more than a clear margin
we arent theorising 100 v 100 fleets as the game shouldnt really be balanced around massive fleet fights and it doesnt really matter about 100 harbs v 100 drakes the drake isnt overpowered its the only decent t1 caldari ship for small gangssolo and just about the only cost effective caldari ship
i cant believe this even needs to be discussed it should be obvious
the best thing that can happen to you is that you discuss a severe bug which you have reported with a bug hunter that bug hunter asks a gm and suddenly you get banned without a word
transparency is a good thing in window glass and in moderation
that is the least ccp should do for banned players
an exact explanation of what was detected with documentation will give away too much informations on how it was detected sending documentation to every ral money trader macro user and so on would blunt ccp hunting tools very fast
so getting banned and asking ccp why you get banned and you dont get any answers for weeks because ccp cant be asked is ok then
yes
same here supporting 
oh how ive wanted this
camo is intended to fit the setting that its in planes use a sky camo below and a ground camo above urban camo matches the grays and whites of the concrete jungle there are camos of various browns and tans to match the sand and rock of the desert white and light grayblack camos match snowy terrain and there are literally dozens of woodland and forest camo designs to fit the multitude of vegetation and woodlands of the world if ya want to use a camo on a spaceship ccp then make it match the enviro  black various subdued shades of color to match nebulae bright splotches to appear as suns and sprinkled dots for the stars cmon use your imagination and get rid of the stupid woodland and terrestrial type camos that look absurd and moronic in space
i agree 100 no more camo in space
jesus christ yes
camo serves as camoflage  there is no jungle in space to be camoflaged in
i cant find the navy megas as it is trying to gank me in recon 33
old surface navy style dazzle camo would be fun to seeplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesanything that could potentially break up the outline of the ship against the background of space not try to hide it from view
i think work should be done to optionally map a pilots corp logo onto the side of their ship i know that would be programming and not art dept but still
it would be more useful to allow one monitor for space view and one monitor for windows viewso that you can extend the game onto anouther monitor without your ship being on the crease between the 2 monitors and would provide more space for windows especally the marketthis would also be useful in allowing you to do other things in eve while mining or gate camping without your space view being cluttered with windows
looks like some fails at readingi would like the option to have no borders on my eve clientswhile this was on my csm agenda im not sure why i never posted it herenice work as alwaystamber
yes plzbut even more than that i want freely resizable client window in windowed mode
i want to have the choice to make an avatar that is the same skin color as myself black why must ccp make a game universe of only white people maybe theyll make some story line missions pertaining as to why theres no black people in the world of eve or maybe theyre a bunch of white supremacist who knows and look out of all the smilies theres not one that resembles a black person wtf
i see him fine in your list of smiliys the two smiliys sitting next to him dont look to happy though if the black smiley disappears it is probably because a hate crime happened after i fixed your post
thats pretty ed up and kinda funnyand im haitian too
black people unite
i heard in this thread i didnt exist
says the achura why didnt you create a brutor
those smiles are yellow not white
 in preparation of chinas new world order and kingdom over all of earth
i knew it was only a matter of time until this thread appeared
does that mean that im just black on the inside
i dont want a avatar that is kinda black because the lightings off i want one that is actually black like myself
its difficult to get sun when youre in a pod 247
in all seriousness this topic has come up before ccp never said why or anything they just ignored it in iceland it is ok to be racistthen again im guessing the issue will be resolved in a month when the character creator comes out if not then it just goes to show you they had a second time to show they are not racist and choose to ignore the issue
all pod pilots should be albino
i thought skin pigmentation was based on the climate that your group of people were raised in over the ages if that is the case we have spent what thousands of years floating around in space that would most likely lead to some regression in pigmentation maybe not to the point that you are ghooooostly white like native icelandics or lapp finns but it would do some havoci guess people do live on planets tho
are you blind or something we have black characters now seriously look at my portrait ffs
inappropriate language removed  adida
there are more varying skin types in the new avatar maker
you had that choice but apparently decided that character stats were more important than skin colour when you started playing the game
since there have been countless debates in different forums about this issue i think the best solution would be to change blue pills to a shield cap boost bonusi think its reasonably logical that you could improve ship shield performance so that overall capacity would rise so for logicstory sake it works it also removes the dual bonus to active tank shield ships while not really hurting active tankers who trained for this pilli think the basic idea would be something like thisbase 30 minutesstandard30 boost to shield capacityside effects 30  increase in shield recharge rate30  explosion velocity penalty30  capacitor capacity penalty30  turret tracking penaltythe higher teirs would add 5 to each effect per levelthis gives supers the chance to gain the buffer they wanted with the downside of harmful negative effects and gives smaller ships a way to increase buffer wo increasing passive tank it also negatively affects smaller ships that try to use invul fields due to the capacitor side effect obviously the drug would need to be used ahead of a fight obviously it would require ccp to fix shield bonuses to work essentially armor and shield would then have a way to gain capacity and a way to gain rate of recharge depending on their choice of either drug or implants its just role reversal for the races

why the hell would anyone sane want to buff buffer tanking which already is way more common than active one
because they use it id vote to buff projectiles even though they dont need it
hi there welcome to 2010 hope you had a good trip over from 2007here in 2010 people fit projectiles and active tanking on appropriate ships
no most of the few viable active tanking setups that exist relies on combining crystals with blue pill and factioncomplex boosters changing blue pill would kill those setups and make active tanking even less viable
i think that ccp should fix the nighthawk by giveing it a bonus to hamshms as it is now the sleipner is faster has more tank than a non passive nighthawk and more dps
not supportedas a former caldari player i can say thisnighthawks are fine
a matari that doesnt want the nighthawk to get better lol
i used to be a caldari pilot this character is new

id love to see hybrids do 1 thing which would make them a worthwhile choice for pvp neutralise cap cant catch a mwding hac with your slow but cap stable deimos hit it with puny damage until it caps out get in close and hit the webscram drones will help with dpsmake gallente ships a legitimate choice for pvp
main problem i see as a blaster piolet is damage modules are low slots and armor tanking is linked to the low slots a few days ago my blaster mega with tech 2 guns got engaged by a maelstrom in close range combat i was like yah finally get to melt somebodys face nope was my face that was melted granted he died but only be cause my corp mates joined me to kill him and save my ass we where trading same blows with his doing slightly higher damage and nearly twice the rate of fire and he aggressed me first in lowsec so he was tanking my blaster damage and sentry damage talk about humilating corp mate said i had too much tank and i was like well wtf would have lost any way because the maelstrom tank is sheild tank which uses mid slots leaving the low slots free for damage modifiers and the sheild boosters even the xl uses only half the power large armor reppers use sure it only boosts half the hp the armor repper does but the time between activations is only 5seconds almost half the time of a large armor repper and you get the hp immediatly while with armor reppers you have to wait for the cycle to finish reason why every one is flying mini ships right now insane alpha able to fit a tank and have the damage modes on it to get a good rof with gallente its really one or the other approach either you melt people but are a glass cannon or you are brick thats slow as hell and do meh damage one possible solution is to seperate armor tanking from the low slots or move the amarr tanking mods to the mid slots allowing them to do both as well cause every one should fear a blaster boat in close quarters combat
if you were dealing only half the damage he was there is something wrong with your mega fit bear in mind whilst he was trading tankgank for tackle you were trading tank for gank chances are if he had you so heavily out tankganked you could have run away
7 fitting requirements ease fitting requirements of hybrid turrets use slots currently used for fitting reactor control units ancilliary current routers for top line hybrids on other modsthat will improve ship performance
that is pretty rare though in comparison to all the ships that dont need it so either ignore cans when saving or have it look for the correct type of container and the appropriate content and then place the can with the content in cargo if both are available when loading the fit
even then  i am more the fan of complete solutions or not doing it at all so unless they will handle cans properly i am still thumbs down just imagine  hit the fit ship button thinking you are ready to go and once you hit the fight you notice  not enough cap booster
sounds like an idea and while youre at it please implement a lot of other stuff thatll probably get ed up too
there should be a check box though save ammo in fit yesno or even better save cargo hold contend yesno
yeah your idea is stupid
no ccp hire me i have brownies
if the op is so smart then why does he have such a stupid name 777 yeah real original and creative there buddy get out
when i next apply for a job i will post anonymously at my potential employers forum claiming that their flagship product has no future unless they put me on the payrollwhat could go wrong
if your iq is so high why cant you find the online job app on eves website and i belive your opinion of yourself is way to high there is almost 0 chance you can fix all of eves problems yourself
and me too i love eating brownies me and that guy would make a great team him and the brownies me and the eating its lovely in my mind
1 information warfare is fine if you dont need those bonuses its not making them a less useful for someone who actually uses it2 current fleet system already allows a flexible mixing with 2 or more cst3hovewer personally i think that bonuses from t3 must be same as from cs well maybe for t3 its will be not a bad idea to reduce bonus to 3 but to all linksso 5050 
anyone who thinks the t3 bonuses are overpowered havent flown a t3 and given bonusesgallente bonuses are fine theres nothing wrong with them if used properly
53all of them giving bonuses from a spot anyway well t3 booster can also no worry about hostile probes
t3s can fit all 3 links with a higher bonus that takes less time to train for while having covert ops cloaking and probing bonuses in addition to being immune to probes and bubblesgranted t3s fitted as command ships with all 3 links will generally not be able to stay on the field though due to lack of tank so field commands have an advantage there
 option turn camera swing offtwo or more accounts  camera swing as if we were on the ocean  not fun why cant the camera remain perfectly still when your ship is i always have the issue of thinking my ship is moving accidentally double click when its just the camera bobbing in random directionsplease add an option so we dont have to get seasick in space
aye o
totally off topic but one pen and paper rpg used the terms coreward vs rimward and spinward vs trailing  but these were developed by denizens of a spiral galaxy rather than our current lenticular cluster so i am not sure how well they would translate
was that game perchance traveler i seem to recall them having those references
i agree so far the tactical overlay hasnt been too tactical would also be nice if you could place markers for your fleet members to see on it by using for example a similar mechanic as homeworld had for its movement commands but i think thats for another topic
in the us military for example there is a legal limit on the number of generalsadmirals that can be in active duty at any one time fw should follow this my proposal create a fixed limit on the number of highest ranks that can exist at any one time and a proprotional limit for all other ranks for example and im just pulling numbers out of a hat here but lets say that the highest rank for each militia was limited to at most 50 pilots then the second rank would be limited to say 5 of the total militia population each lower rank would have an increased number of people until maybe the lowest 3 ranks which one could reach regardless of the number of pilots who had it ranks would be based on a point system which one gets for conqueringsecuring fw plexes andor success in battle with enemy militia pilots this is to make ranks a bit more meaningful and something that people have to constantly work at competivitely to stay on top maybe a montly lp reward could be attached to create insentives such as top ranks get 30000 lp per month just for being able to maintain that rank for a majority of that month also to make it so people actually have to participate in actual combat and conquering to gain top ranks doing fw missions reward significantly less points than combat so carebears who just run missions all the time arent constantly ranked at the top versus people who are always out there participating in battles one more thing maybe there can be a system such that people actually can lose points for things like failing to prevent a plex from being captured in effect only if you engage a target trying to capture a plex and fail to prevent them from capturing it
now watch people create alts in the opposing militia and constantly pop it to increasemaintain their rankits an interesting idea ill give you that but its too open to abuse in its current formplus no one really cares about plexs ranks and system occupancy save for the role players not that there is anything wrong about being one its perfectly fine im just not one again not that i dont like them or anything 
which is why there needs to be an improvement to the current system along with the payout of lp make ranks and plexes and system occupation actually worth it increase your rank get more lp which means more money limiting ranks help to create a competetive environment plus maybe there can be safegaurds against having a lot of repeated kills within a certain timeframe to reduce abuse
rp wise ranks would only matter to the npcs anyway and currently npcs in the game show no regard to rank and any system like this is going to be extremely gamable so while not a bad idea theres no point and even if there was its not doableedit concerning the above post  what you are proposing is a complete revamp of the structure of fw which id be interested in even though ccp would never do it regardless but its a ways outside this particular proposal in the op
some time ago a bunch of turds decided to dabble a bit and came up with a way to not show up in local chat a lot of smoke was spotted and rumor has it a few may have gotten temp bans in the wakea few days ago a few pilots i know came across a ship they found it and noticed a few odd things according to numerous buddy lists the pilot was logged on but for some reason he did not show up in local chatafter dispatching the vessel a few inquiries were made a gm oddly refused to investigate on the grounds that no evidence had been presentedif a gm had stalked this particular person for any length of time he would have noticed that he frequently appears to have lets say issues with his client not allowing him to be shown in localnaturally the person in question and his friends are usually content to make use of such wild claims to amuse and entertain the eve community my issue however has to do with the inherent flaw in gm policy how can a potential eula breach ever be investigated if the criteria for starting an investigation is that the accuserpetitioner delivers absolute proofthis points to a central problem  witness accounts are not accepted as evidence the account itself by its very nature does not provide proof it does however warrant an investigation if a gm decides not to investigate in spite of witnesses accounts then he is in effect making a ruling that the accuserpetitioner is lyingi am not sure how to turn this in to a proper csm issue and i am not sure if it even belongs there i do have reservations about the specific case either the person lets call him abecirkel in question is cheating again or the people who said he was online but not in local lied to a gm in a petitioneither way we the community have a problem with how these cases are handledalso anomaly respawns are bugged and a lot of people will not accept wait three downtimes as a solution
i agreethis should be a priority for ccp to prevent it even to be possible ccp please look into this 
there are many issues heresince there as schani stated there are no appeals so once again if you cheat ccp and makes isk isk farmers then you will be banned for live cheat against a fellow player and that player not only has to prove that the other is the offender and what he has done but he is for all practical purposes accused as being a liar and you get scot free and the gm wont even follow up on it even thou it is something the accused already have been found guilty of the first is that ccp acknowledge that he was cheating by making a patch for the cheat but they did not reimburse those that lost their shipsthe patch does not work obviouslythe offending player is still in the game that makes me wonder if he got a friend no it cant be furthermore even this time those that attacked him shot the offender and have no reason to be vindictive other then they doesnt like to play against cheatersif you look at ccps policies on this then abecirkel should no longer be able to play since he is guilty of 1a 1b 1c  partly 1e and 1f how many more policies do a player and his accomplices have to be guilty of before they are banned permanentlyquote of ccps policys on suspension and ban policy1 exploitsan immediate permanent ban of an account may result if  a investigation shows that a player has employed the use of an exploit tactic despite a public announcement being made to alert players they will be banned for using it b a player who has been previously warned for exploiting and continues to exploit whether using the same exploit or another c an account holder guilty of employing duping exploits players found to have received the benefits of this exploit may also face reprimand from removal of the items in question up to and including banning of their accounts d a player has engaged in activity that intentionally causes others to lose connection suffer latency issues lag or to crash to desktop ctd e a player renders himself invulnerable through the use of a bug f a player has created distributed or advertised an illegal 3rd party program ie macro or cheat program that disrupts game mechanics is considered unfriendly or gives an unfair advantage by misusing game features in a way for which they were not intendedsevere offences may result in an immediate ban without warning however warnings may be given for first time offenses followed by account suspensions of varying degree and ultimately a permanent ban if a player  a creates a character using a name that is misleading and causes others to believe he is a fair target such as a nonplayer pirate or other npc entity b is discovered to be employing the use of a third party program to macro illegally funds or goods received from the benefits of macroing are subject to removal from the players inventory c is aware of an exploitable bug and fails to report it to game masters andor distributes the information to other players
screenshots or much better a nice fraps showing the exploit would be very helpful
have you and your friends escalated to a senior gm or contacted ccp internal affairs
emphasis mineyoure funny
about half of the bounty prizes are rattinganomplex so approximately 440000000000average tax is 10 that mean that the different alliances get about 40 bil in taxes on bounties alone against 59 bil in sovereign costs add the refining taxes mandatory corpalliance mining and ratting ops moon goo exactions and reactions and capitals sales and it seem there is a good positive inflow both in the alliances pockets and in those of the single pilot
assuming the 440bil is only from sov 00 plexesanoms etc what this shows is that sov alliances are only just covering their sov costs before reimbursements etc whilst empire mission runners with no sov bills and minimal pve losses are doing far better of course it isnt as clear cut as that because there are likely more pilots sharing that mission running bounty pie but it doesnt change the fact that their outgoings are minimal ammo mostly compared to 00 residents who have to replace lost ships all the timeof course some of those anoms are likely npc 00 and lowsec so the 440bil is likely even less than that you didnt quote the breakdown there i cant analyse furtherall in all pretty strong evidence that many 00 alliances are not rolling around in isk isnt it
lies damned lies and statistics

a bunch of moody amarrians in hoods chanting bela lugosis dead over and over
confirming that my kitsune has been gathering dust on a shelf in my hangar sincewell when i bought it pretty mucheas just go squish too easily for you to get the full measure of use out them vs cov ops or the t1 equivalents and yes having to rig a kitsune to take advantage of its ecm bonus is annoying
having never flown any of the eafs i am not going to touch the balancedesign particulars that being said there are two immediate questionscomments that result from reading this thread1 if you argue that eafs need a sig reduction perhaps it is best not to say that a 3 sig reductionlvl hyenais the most useless bonus a frig can have i understand what your driving at but it seems contraditory on its face2 it occurs to me that it isnt clear where these ships are supposed to function if ccp thinks that eafs should be mostly used when attacking frigdessie size targets and design the bonuses around this then they will probably never be used to any great extent the lack of use is more a function of current pvp style bad expression sorry and not so much a function of being underpowered for its job additionally if this is thier focus then eaf capabilities do not need to be all that robustin general unless they envision eafs being used solo if however ccp wants eafs to be used by more conventional gangs and attacking a large array of target sizesthey must find a way to justify thier use over the recon class or even over the blackbird in the case of the kitsunewhile not making better in all cases replacingi wont pretend to know what ccp considers the role of eafs are if they even had a full conception in the first place but it seems to me this question needs to be anwered for any meaningful rebalancing to occureditforgot to support
excellent suggestions
i completely agree with everything if super carriers are being piloted more than eafsthats all the proof thats needed eaf is a pure pvp ship theres nothing else you could possibly do with it every version needs buffed to the point where it would be a viable asset to any pvp fleet of any size
there was a discussion about these ships in the sm forum and i submit that here for reference
the 3 signature radius reduction that the hyena currently has is almost the same bonus that interceptors used to have before the speed nerf the interceptors got a 5 signature radius reduction per level it was discovered with the changes that they instapopped at the new lower speeds interceptors had their bonus changed to the current 15 reduction of mwd sig radius penaltylvl the poor hyena was left as is i dont know what the right level would be the hyena shouldnt get the same bonus as the interceptors it needs a much smaller signature radius and perhaps a 9 reduction of the mwd sig radius penaltylvl all of the eas frigates need more survivability
please dont boost the sentinel then someone other than me will fly it and i wont feel special anymore okay just kidding im not sure what the official role is supposed to be for eafs but it seems to me that theyre supposed to provide ewar support for frigate gangswhy fly the kitsune in a gang when the blackbird offers more ehp and can jam at a much greater distance and is a lot cheaperthe kitsune with eas trained to 5 can easily get a jam strength higher than the blackbird however is the extra strength worth it benefits of the kitsune over the blackbirdhigher jamming strengthsmaller faster more agilehigher scan resolutionbenefits of the blackbird over the kitsunecheaper even filly fit and riggedgreater targeting and jamming distancegreater ehpcan do damage albeit small at rangeit would seem that the trade off here would be greater jamming strength for reduced survivability however the jam strength of the kitsune isnt all that much higher  a bit over 1 point using standard fits and decent skills if you rig the blackbird for full ecm strength the benefit is about half a point and it can still jam out farther than the kitsunethe kitsune is really only useful when you are flying frigate class fleets and need the mobility and only economical when youre getting into small scale fights the kitsune simply cannot afford to get hit while the blackbird can take a few shots without having to warp out this is a very limited rolealong with the reduction in signature radius the kitsune may also benefit from an extra 5 jam strength per level boosting the capacitor bonus would be nice too im a bit on the fence about giving it more targeting range  then you could have a small sig ship sitting 80km off with greater strength than the bb
if you throw a sensor booster w a targeting range script it can lock out to 105km with close to a 100km optimal range on its jammers the problem then is that you only can fit three jammersthe kitsune also has a higher sensor strength then the blackbird  its harder to jam the kitsune needs a smaller signature radius then the 58m it currently has it also should get the same lock range scan resolution as the griffin  its t1 counterpart you could then get those three jammers out to 120km with the optimal range bonus its different then the rookfalcon  you actually have a reason to climb into it the kitsune is easy to fix and it should be fixed
thats true i always try to have all 4 jammers on my ship and a mwd i guess im a graduate from the merin ryskin school of ship fitting time to raise even more hell then i suppose
they definitely need love
agreed
bust it 
a reason to actually train the skills beyond plugged in yes please
they really need fixed

not necessarily these changes but some changesresistances on par with their bigger brothers combat recons would be a good start a caldari heavy assault ships shield resistances are 0705080 while the rook has 0625070 the assault ships shield resistances are the same as the heavy assault ship but the kitsunes resistances are 0555060 making them quite a bit lower other eaf resistances compare similarlyif they arent set apart from their big brothers in terms of capabilities they should at least have comparable bonuses the keres in particular is a poor choice when the lachesis has a 20 instead of 10 bonus to warp disruptorscrambler range the down side to the keres should be that its smaller and easier to kill not that it has to get twice as close to be effective  where rangescripted sensor dampeners will do it absolutely no good its already got fewer slots to fill with remote sensor dampeners i understand the reasoning for the smaller bonus there arent sizes of warp disruptors and scramblers so its a way to make the smaller ship have a smaller effect but it means that for direct conflict there is really not much reason to choose a keresthere are myriad ways to improve these frigates
up
thx don pellegrino for posting the linkthat would be really sadccp what is correct  will they come or not sandrine starfire
definitely something i would love to see again
im not gonna say i support your idea nor am i gonna shoot it down instead i am gonna say thisim my time in the eveverse i have trained many different skills sci combat support ect even when i ended up training a not so useful skill invention when i was a mission char it still eventually turned out useful so personally i dont see a terrible need for it it is a game of patience and sometimes it takes time to get past those things that you maybe did a bit too earlyon the other hand if you were really that picky and didnt want to check out and use many of the aspects of the game then i suppose i wouldnt necessarily object but realize that i believe that there should be a hefty penalty for doing so and i dont mean you pay isk isk cost is a joke in most circumstances you should have to temporarily shed attribute points to do so maybe a week or two of 25 or so to training speed on top of a limit to how much sp you can move around does it hurt yes but it should after all you are rewriting your character sheetjust my feelings about this matter
no but if it ever got implemented any sp you take out of a skill would forever lock you from ever remapping sp into it again and prevent you from ever learning it again why cause eve haz consequences until someone decides that it shouldnt and we have a proposal
another idea which we can only hope that not be applied but it can as some other stupid ones
yeah i think it would help to introduce some manner of mining mini game to make mining less boring but mostly to cut down on people using macros i think you could still have the same amount of roids in a belt but people would just focus on one or two roids at a time also for the noobs i would make it so that skill point wise the mining mini game is just as accessible as old miningso you have to ask will noobs be frightened by a complex minigame to mine asteroids ask yourself how many noobs know how to do planetary interaction or use scan probesccp even had to make youtube tutorials for pi and probes
i say yes finally one nice idea regarding mining and macroers what would i like to add that it is really not necessary to merge all roids in the belt in one big rock as it gives an abuse number of miners of one corpallygangalts shall be sitting on the most profitable veins while everyone else will be forced to have tiny pieces as their meal what is really affordable is to make asteroid belts dramatically wider at the space make bigger rocksas topic starter propose just to replace ten of present stones with onethis can free some server resouces what would i personnaly like to see is the asteroid belts around moons or planets it seems to be interesting to have some minable saturn rings also this sort of mining can be hardned with some gravity anomalies wich will affect ship to be towed inside belt or to a planet atmosphere where not so easy to maneuvre or even dangerous to be just reminded me the x3reunion making a game inside game is awesome i support fully more control more action more profit  these three can resurrect live mining and bury macroers
having recently stated play a mmorpg that has mini games to gather resources i think new players will not be frightened but they will not be enticed tooa mini game is good if you can gather a significant quantity of material in a few minutes but the current mining operations require hours of gaming a mini game where every few seconds you need to calibrate your laser point your laser on the right spot cycle your laser for the right time will become annoying and boring very fast so to compensate for the extra annoyance and real player unwillingness to do minigames for a long period you would need to increase yield but if you increase yield even an inefficient macro or a sweatshop worker paid to stare at the screen for 8 hours will get more rewarding and they will own the mineral production even more than today and btw from my recent experience a mining minigame will require much more communication to and from the server so more lagso unless it is done very very well i am against mining minigames
not supportedccp doesnt do minigames very well pi is a perfect exampleultimately defeating the macro is in our best interest but probably not in the best interest of ccp since its subscription revenue and nay once has there been a post from ccp expressing concern or desire to combat the problemslug it out in null sec or find a new profession in imo i yielded empire grounds to macros a long while back the only viable alternative ive seen in the past that would be feasible where ccp wouldnt have to spend a money on is is moving empire belts to grav sites with a very low level scanning requirement like one scanning probe to pick it up you could probably kill off some macros that way but again the absence of ccps comments on the subject leads me to believe its a revenue over fraud
i was on the csm while the old system was in development we had no real input
werent there supposed to be things like treaties and game mechanic enforced rental agreements or any changes to the sov system i seem to remember a promise along those lines something about how they would continue to update and improve the new sov system
lots of stuff went wrong in the creation of the sov system so a lot of features got dropped i think if ccp took another crack at it these bad things arent likely to happen again we just have to convince them its worth it to try
oh yea forgot to 1 100s of millions of hitpoints are dumb
o
i support ccp at the very least iterating on ideas touched on when discussing sov changes in dominion
sov mechanics really need a change atm huge blobs are the only way to do sov warfare 
id love to see what documentation you have that can support this claim
at the fan fest prior to dominion ccp openly says they worked with the csm on the new sov system even the csm sat there with a smug look on their face proud of it
nad that was probably their only involvement sitting with a smile
so ccp and the csm lied to us i guess im not really surprised
time to iterate ccp
im being t o t a l l y serious your idea is great and my suggestions are even better never stop postingoh man those mission runners and highsec dwellers will have to pay big time that will teach them not to ruin our game with their nasty carebearing ways
3 entries in that top 15 where decent the rest was blahagree with all that ccp should pick the final entries themselves also i wonder what the flips that pr expert at da was smokingsigned from herecb
i keep finding ship after ship that are better designed more inline with racial styles yet not similar to current stuffso yes the current 15 seem to have been picked totally at random the point of this contest was to get good ships not to let da judges pick random ships theyre obviously not qualified to judge if theyve never played the game
the judging was just abysmal
this was a bs contest this was my favorite shipmegalodonhow did this get chosen no offense to the artist cause its a great drawing but it doesnt fit with eve at allbes poor job at understanding the eve universe
yeah several of the semis are a bit missplaced also too me it looks like they didnt care much if the submission looked like a ship already existing in eve either
thats exactly what i thought i loved the megaladon design but instead they give us a giant space vagina
well in all honesty we do need more giant space vaginas you know to balance out ships like the thorax the armageddon the stabber etc etc etc
hopefully you have the option to combine with a thorax to create besax which would then spew out drones until everything had died
imo the whole contest is a disaster ccp should have given more information on what they were looking for and less vagueheres a good example telling people it should look like itd fit into eve is pointless because theres very little in terms of common ship design an amarrian ship looks vastly different than an minnie ship for example rather than posing a chart they should have made a list of things that should be included like engines rather than star trek style nacelles and things not to doit probably didnt help that the chart they posted includes all the ships in the game including sleeper models talocan models and jovian ships none of which are public and none of which are likely to become publicthe second problem is that they didnt make it clear what they starship will be used for for example if i posted an amarrian factory ship would they discard it because theyre not looking to make 3 other empire ships of the same type are these ships going to be standard models or one of gifts all this information would have helped focus the design efforts of these artists towards producing better ships
i didnt even bother to follow the main of the competition and looking at it now im kind of gladit annoys the hell out of me that practically all of the semifinalists seem completely ignorant of eves own art style or back history im glad they put the tornado up there after all without it only the only ship i could even remotely imagine seeing in space would be the tsunami too many flashy lights without a single familiar shape that i can relate to any of the factions aside from the advertising transport which is pretty much the iteronlots of good art sure but almost nothing i would want to run into in the game
patheticccp should have judged all  da blew itserious competitors summarily cast aside  its insanitythey admitted to not reading descriptions or even having knowledge of the game  fail
this kind of rudeness is why we cant have nice things if you think da sucks imagine what that community thinks of eve online right now
when i first saw the little box at login advertising this my thought was oh dear this is going to end badly
just my 2 centsccp next time please use conceptartorg for this contest instead
if their feelings are hurt or how they perceive the eve community has no bearing on the argument that in general the semifinalists are heartily agreed to be disagreeable this was a test whether intended or not to see if the people of deviantart were compatible with that of eve online
that is a cool site i would have suggested
supported even with tornado in there this has been a  poor contest and the da staff are clearly s
if this contest had been run on either of those two sites you would have had some fantastic mind blowing entries produced by professionals in the field and eve would have ended up with an incredible looking new ship on the downside though you would only have had about 50100 entries as most people would have considered the competition out of their league since this was largely a marketing exercise the point was to garner publicity and enthusiasm from as many people as possible the choice of deviantart does make sense it was a good plan there are many fantastic artists on da and some excellent designs were produced the plan went south because the da judges failed to pick from the best entries instead picking semi finalists seemingly at random
supported there are way too many amazing entries that lost to completely uneverelated designsbasically das judges dont know eve we know eve we should vote on them ourselves or have someone else who knows eve a devdesigner do the selections and then let the final 4 up to a vote
signedsupportedagreei officially hate deviantart nowthe entire top 15 needs to be reselected by a more professional competent and eveknowledgeable source
so the whine is that entries were judged on aesthetics and the official posted rules rather than omg id totally fly that i must say i rather like the semifinalists nice spread of various styles  sure some wouldnt really fit into eve without some pf shenanigans but considering the crap ccp came up with for the silly special shuttle and other gift ships i doubt that is a hindrancesnippet from rulesyou would have to go way off the track to not meet those criteria ie adding legs and crap no support as its a pointless issue
1 take a closer look to all the other entriesnot only most popular you will find far better ships even more original better fitted to eve standards with better presentation ecc2 if you read the rules you will find also in the beginninghow you missed that but also in the contest article
if people of eveonline would be compatiable witheachother we would not have trolls and wars but thats what makes eve fun
i vote that a new type of npc is being created so i can have fun blowing up something deviantartrelated over and over and over and overthat pencil ship was better than the stupid battlecruiser someone threw together in half a minute
signedthere are far more beautiful ships that actually fit into the eve universe and for that part creations that not only looked beautiful but also had thought behind themgiving us some lame excuse like our views differ makes me wonder why deviant art was chosen and makes me wonder why the hell they didnt atleast study eve online in order to make more informed decisionsin short  deviant art and let ccp judge the best ship they created all of the ones in game after all and those are pretty nice if deviant art created the ships for eve we would have flying roses and fedex boxes
supportedanother additional  way to limit the i win button effect of the use or not use of drugs would be to give as side effect the impossibility to train skills for a certain amount of time after you have used it hard to learn anything when you step down after a drug trip this will much more make ppl who are rich thinking twice before using drugsanother additional drawback of using drugs could be the possibility to die ppl with 22m sp will not be bothered  ppl with 103m sp a little more
thanks everyone for your participation voting is now closed so i can prepare the proposal for the next meeting
this is an awesome idea
i really dont understand these antidrake posts for three years the drake has been lol drake noob lets kill im nothing has changed with the drake since its inception no wait there was a change it had its passive tank nerfed once other than that no change to the shipdrakes arent that powerful its still just a bc with a good tank and mediocre delayedeffect damage at long range its not particularly fast and has a ridiculously high sig the ship is just popular at the moment because fleets of battleships are fodder for fighter bombers once the fb changes go thru in incursion youll see fleets of amarr bs cutting thru drake blobs like nobodys business
this the drake is fine
no
well people would like to enjoy their overpowered crap as long as they can thus you cant really expect them to vote against themselvesits pretty obvious fugly drakes are that popular for a reason and the reason is they are overperforming for their cost if a tech1 ship has any 
sending the account holder a you were banned for rmt activities message is giving away their hunting tools really
support banning without a good reason being presented is like the bank taking your house while you are sleeping in it also people that are innocent dont have to spend so much time sweating over what they didnt do
due to the proliferation of an abundant amount of super carriers showing up all over the place due to being op over powered there needs to be some balancing done to themsuper carriers will no longer be allowed to launch fighter bombers unless they have the combat seige module activated this of course means a new module would be introduced that would go in the high slot it would use strontium just like other seige type modules it would last for 15 minutes per cycle only when in seige will a super carrier be allowed to launch fighter bombers
think we need to wait and assess the fighter bomber rebalance thats upcoming before thinking about something like thisnow if the rebalance doesnt work then maybe this might be a good idea but as it stands i think we need to wait and seenot supported for now but could change after the rebalance
i dont really support this the problem is the fighterbombers not the actual scs
with the upcoming already announced rebalance of fighter bombers already on the plate for incursion any other changes to super carriers would be prematurenot supported

so this is a project that has spanned over the past 6ish months lately you may have seen this proposal on some other player driven forums ive finally decided to formally propose it due to the obvious problems of posting 4 pages and then reformating for it to look properly ive uploaded a pdf version to a well known file sitethese are obviously meant as suggestions and there might be some oversightsenjoy
true but ganking takes up more slots then a single point to get that kind of rof i would have to sacrfice several low slotsat with blasters your at a point blank and the mega only going 800900ms average with mwd you have about a good 1520seconds before your out of point range and when you decide that you probably at about 50 armor or maybye less depending on the situtation so yes running is probably a option but takes only a single point to prevent warp and with the mini show range guns having 20 km falloff theyll be hitting hard the entire time while the blasters only have a 10km falloff

just about sums it up

we have run across this again recently as wellwhile a cov ops was observing a pos in system they noticed that there were quite a few ships moving around behind the pos shield that of course is nothing new but the problem is a number of them were being flown by pilots that were not showing up in locala petition was filed along with screenshots but to date i am not sure if anything was ever done about it
burden of proof should be on ccp who are the ones to investigate and take actionthe petition was closed by a gm due to lack of evidence and as such ccp have determined that no violations or bugs caused this particular persons client to malfunction in such a useful mannerand that is exactly my point fraps logs and screenshots are easily faked and as someone pointed out banning does have a finality to it it would be equally problematic to accept screenshots or fraps from customers as evidence and elevate it to proofccp would need to do some sort of verification themselves and that would require their gms to think about what their role isin this case i could simply state that the circumstances surrounding this case points to the gm in question protecting the persons rather than investigating them this is exactly the kind of accusations that prompted the formation of the csm in the first placeif these types of cases require investigation it should be a ccp employee doing the job not some arrogant and biased misanthrope like myself they simply decided to not look into the matterthis simple case of a possible repeat cheater is just an example there are plenty of issues out there that find themselves in the limbo between bug and feature gms keep telling you have you filed a petition and the bughunters keep rejecting your petition because they arent competent or equipped to recreate the problem and thus it fails to live up to bugcriteriait is exactly this kind of smug arrogance that es paying customers off failure to react intelligently to inquiries is getting in the way of effective customer servicei have now made a few more people aware of a particular case and tried to make a general observation on the subject maybe a ccp evaluationteamjulefrokost can use the input i am now back in game and unlikely to be posting more on the matterjust keep in mind that an empty local chat is not necessarily empty
but this is exactly the point of my post and the first row of your reply say you arent tackling ityou suggest that the specific gm that has replied to your petition is biased possible but then you refuse to use the instrument ccp gave you to get a second appeal against a biased gm simply because burden of proof should be on ccpappealing to a senior gm is there to get a second and hopefully more competent opinion on the possible exploit appealing to internal affairs is there to confront a possible malpractice issue with biased gmyour refusal of using those instrument make your whole position that of a thin hatter saying there are conspirations all around him not those of a rational person trying to resolve a problem with a probable exploit

loli dont think you will find that new wow expansion cataclysm to be fun maybe you can accomplish something meaningful there
i assume this decision is a result of ccp moving forword with plex for remap while i personally dont have a huge issue with plexremap i can understand peoples concern for the game to move into full blown micro transaction territory which i dont think anyone wants your decision to get rid of everything seems a bit rash and or overkill but i imagine youve given it sufficient thought and i can respect someone who can follow through with their convictions instead of threats to leave the game to try and influence decision making ive never interacted with you but always felt you were a stand up player who did great things for the community through your events and csm work your presence will be missed good luck with wherever your path takes you and fly safe
can ihave your stuffalso thanks for representing the average eve player you did a pretty good job
if there was a official breakdown i would gladly have quoted it the probable 440 billions day are based on the mission reward payouts for bonus timer and base mission and the general rapport between those values for me and the mission bounties if the average mission runners do more vs faction missions where there arent bounties but only tags or drone missions than me the part of the pie generated by anomalies complexes and ratting could be higher while if a large percentage of missions runners have a low level of negotiation improbable the mission running part of the pie could be larger proportionally for someone with no negotiation skill the bounties have a larger impact than the mission rewardsso 440 bills is what i consider a reasonable guesstimate i doubt ccp will be capable of giving better data as the anomalies have deadspace rats like the missions non 00 exploration sites have a low impact while npc 00 ratting and exploration is subject to corp taxes and generally dominated by 00 alliances even if they dont pay sovereignty in those systems that are the reasons why i say  alliances get about 40 bil in taxes and not 44 billions 10 of 440 bills again a guesstimate but a reasonable one all inclusive it appear that about 23 of the sovereignty costs are covered by the taxes on rattinganomplexing alone and the character doing missions in high sec are taxed too and the corp get the isk the same dont forget thatthen there are the other 00 activities that generate wealth for the corp an the alliance so no i disagree with you a decently managed alliance has a lot of isk both liquid and in assets simply most of the alliances tend to downplay the value of the assets they own the titans and capitals used by the corp members have a value and unless they have been fully paid back by the user they should not be considered a property of the guy using it same thing for the towers modules stored minerals ecc ecc ecc saying alliances havent hundreds of billions of liquid isk available dont mean they arent richit simply mean they do the right thing and use the liquid isk to produce assets that will make them stronger
i dont believe that every sov holding alliance does this kind of thing i know for a fact a lot of them dont the numbers roll together carebear alliances living in safe napped space and pvp alliances who dont rat all day and instead lose ships you cant draw accurate conclusions based on the figures provided in fact i maintain that it shows a distinct split between sov 00 who have this huge isk sink and empirenpc regions who dont have that issue not all sov 00 alliances have corp funded capitals etc it isnt possible to draw conclusions along these lines without more info i disagree not all alliances who hold space are using it to make isk etc some hold it for strategic value and have to find the isk from somewhere elsewithout a better break down of these figures the conclusions are very speculative

i really really like the idea of using ammo to change the way hybrids work however i want to point out that base shield and armor dmg stats are not what you think they are they are only what your average dmg will be against nonmodified t1 hulls based on the amount of each of the dmg types you are using not the minimum amount of dmg you will do against either shield or armor in order to raise those base shield and base armor dmg stats you will need to change dmg types if that is what you are proposing i vehemently support this
looking at the hybred turret issue i decided to analyize the basic numbers of the turrets such as damage mod range capacitance use cost per shot etc and see if i could paint a detailed picture on what is wrong with the blasters i know youve moved into looking at changing the ammo but lets step back and take a looka few assumptions i am making if you refute these then this analysis is not for youwe are looking at all the t2 models the data for each has been pulled from the wikiprice per shot is the average cost for all the t1 ammo availablelaser price per shot is 0 iskshot assuming crystals dont break like faction ammo or t2we desire the range of blasters to be between the autocannons and pulse lasers in both falloff and optimal respectivelyrailguns should have closeto equivilent damage as a respective beam laserthere is an issue with the ammos current arrangementt2 turret analysis spreadsheetif you dont want to read the spreadsheet below are my conclusionsblaster optimal is doubled falling halfway between pulse laser optimal and autocannon optimalblaster falloff is increased by 36 again halfway between pulse lasers and autocannons falloff this leads total ranges for blasters to fall between pulse lasers and autocannonsrailgun damage mod is increased by varing degrees usually 48 modifier to get a damage closer but still weaker than beam lasersthe capacitance drain reduction on ammo is inconsistant and i changed it to reflect the laser crystal capacitance drain reductionhowever the biggest problem is cost per shot while hybreds appear to pay less per shot on average not a true average since i didnt have the time to weigh the averages based on market movement of each ammo type it is obvious that most hybred users choose antimatter the most expensive type this means that hybred users pay about the same as projectile users if not more due to the focus on a single ammo type which increases demand and thus prices and also has to pay with capacitance which takes power from other more vital systems such as ewar propulsion etc the ammo has no special effects compared to the others lasers can switch quickly but it takes 10 seconds to reload other turrets or change the ammo in there projectiles have tracking bonuses based on which type however there is no such bonuses for hybreds an alteration of the ammo is needed but what that alteration is needs testing suggestions include rate of fire alterations 5 falloff bonuses 510 or maybe a various selection of small bonuses that are different for each ammo type like tracking 5i hope these numbers helpedit made corrections to the spreadsheet
for the keres id propose higher dronebay and bandwidth 50 bay 25 bandwidth change the tackle boni to something not used already by ceptors dictors and recon add a bonus to ewar drones 5 or 75 bonus on their respective effectsfor all ewars i propose smaller sig radius standard targetting range of at least 60km ewar ships are back row ships not front row grunts reduced cost to produce bonus to cloaking devices like blackopsdont know if that would be out of whack though would imply an additional utility high slot
the keres and hyena have a tackling bonus this puts them in direct competition with inties for the keres remove the tackling bonus and instead give it better effect on the damps or better cap usage for them i dont know what to do about painters because painters are so full of fail the whole lineup needs a complete redorethink
the hyena could be a nice tackler antitackler just extend the webifier range bonus to 3040 currently 20 recons have 60 and reduce the signaturethere is no reason that ewarfrigates of any kind should be 60 larger than other frigates i would propose to cut that to 30
the compare tool is a useful ingame tool but its limited to ships that have variations and ships that you can drag into the window from your ship hangar that is ships you already ownsometimes the user will want to compare ships that dont have variations as one example the different versions of the iteron cannot be compared because the mark ii iv and v dont technically have variations so they can only be included on the compare tool if you already own such a ship and can drag it from your ship hangar into the compare toolas another example one cannot compare the myrmidon to the vexor and dominix without owning a myrmidon already because the myrmidon does not have any variationsproposal give all ship show info windows a variations tab even if the ship itself doesnt have any variationsalternate proposal add to the rightclick menu for inventory items including ships an add to compare tool option
shiftheaded approves of this proposal
this particular point is more difficult then you might think im fairly sure the actual application of damage is fairly far removed from the weapon firing effect as far as your client is concerned when you fire your client more or less blindly produces a turret firing effect that isnt actually tied to the damage the attack may cause or not cause and simply repeats this blind production of effects periodically at the rate at which your weapons fire this is easily noticable when you cancel your weapon firing sometimes your client produces an extra fireeffect when your turrets didnt actually fire and of course did no damage and actually continues to display firingeffects even when youre disconnectedim uncertain if this is the case with incoming damageeffects but i suspect it may be handled the same way seeing as how your ship getting hit and the damage being applieddisplayed often seems to be offsync as well and you continue to see incoming effects while disconnected as well this manner of handling is likely done to prevent any lag from being blatantly obvious effectively shunting the lag into a desync between effect and damage rather then having the time between the effectdamage seem to be inconsistant as well as probally saving a small bit of bandwidth in the processtldr theres no association between a weapons graphical effect and the affectdamage it has as far as your eve client is concerned

supported fleet command ships need upgraded these are t2 battlecruisers t1 battlecruisers shouldnt be owning them in stats and so forth t2 cost moret2 bcs require a  ton of skills they need to be better plain and simple

thissome people just want to get some sp so they can fly their titan soonernot supported
not supportedwhile i understand the redundant nature of this skill set they provide a valid mechanic to the over all game by providing both a path for more specialization in a specific area and ambiguity to how many skill points any one character might have
for playerslime me who have their learnings maxed its very small differencebut for those who have something like 43 for few years its not fair  they wasted so much sp arleady just because of laziness and now every noob will not loose sp because of thiswell i think such people doesnt care much about their sp anyway
honestly if there comes a time when sp can be bought or gained faster using money or isk i will not resub
wtf ccp
for the love of god no
so many good looking entries that look like they belong in the eve universe id like to know if ccp plans on introducing a new race to mesh with one of the noneve designs
not going to happen would cause too many legal issues from the 15 that made it to the semis never mind the pr onespick the best entry from the 15 incorporate that ship award the other prizesthen go through the full list of entries and see which other ships should also be included with any luck they can get a full racial seti would definately be interested in seeing a full list of the valid entries with the da scoring for each though

i really like the idea i considered using boosterssmugglingmaking them for a long time but it just didnt seem that worthwhile in their current state too costly for the benefits if any and not enough demand to sell for the amount of effortmay not be an entirely accurate viewpoint but it seems to be commonunder this proposal though i could definitely see myself using boosters just like a jumpclone overheating implants rigs etcas for the after effects im liking the idea of reduced learning makes a lot of sense too going cold turkey has a damn negative mental effecta kind of similar effect to using a jumpclone with no implants reduced attributes and all that
as someone who uses combat boosters on a regular basis there are a number of points here i disagree with some of your ideas are good but certainly not allproductioncombat boosters are currently difficult to produce this is mainly due to the raw materials being seeded poorly and a terrible investmenttimereturn ratio more access to the possibility of production in low sec is a good idea however denying 00 residents any and every opportunity to be self sufficient is bad therefore my point is simple reseed booster materials through both 00 and low sec with a focus on even distributionbooster consumption and penaltiesunder current game mechanics booster penalties are tied to the ship they are consumed in not the pilot this means boosters consumed in a place where the users can quickly switch ships results in no penalties at all this also means side affects are only associated with one scenario a pilot in space quickly takes boosters in an attempt to gain a combat advantagethe above scenario is exactly the time and place a penalty if any should be applied boosters can give a significant advantage in combat and there is immediate risk involved this is how it should remain alternatively the drawback to using boosters in station or at a pos is that it may run out before a fight actually occurs i have experienced this many timesthe op suggests that current side affects are a major reason why combat boosters are not used to put it bluntly this is untrue they are not used because of their costs they last for an hour or less and the best boosters can cost upwards of 50m each the skill books required to use them effectively are also prohibitively expensive for new players one in particular costing anywhere from 200m to 300mthe op then follows her reasoning to suggest ideas of addiction and longer negative effects associated with boosters this is one scenario where realism is not useful simply put it would not be fun there is enough in eve that is not fun already the current system gives you something immediately and penalizes immediately its fun there is risk it works the point negative side affects are good as they are if anything simply apply one or two of them not all 4 under worst case scenarios make the booster skills cheapermore boosters bettermore options is always a good thing however boosters related to mundane tasks such as mining or production seem just plain silly the point of boosters now is that they give players the opportunity to gain an advantage which may allow their internet spaceship to survive while their opponents does not it may work it may not and either way you had to spend isk on it it is this uncertainty which makes boosters interesting and difficult to use which is what i expect was the original intention if boosters were ever added which improved the success rate of lowno risk activities they would simply become another factor in the equations of profitability such a reliable boost would become required and standard this is not desirable even the op listed boosters becoming standard as a con in her original post the point boosters should continue to be something only useful in high risk situationsconclusion what is the damn point of my long responsereading this post the assumptions premises and conclusions provided concerned me first i question the experience of the original poster with boosters other then the production phase why is a csm delegate spending time on something they are inexperienced with shouldnt they be spending energy on other issues for which they are knowledgeable second some not all of this csm delegates conclusions are faulty based on poor premises and could make problems worse instead of fix them their ideas do not appear well thought outin this case i applaud your effort but not its resultmj
boosters need buffs but not like this smuggling should be worth it as well i think if ships designed to smuggle they have reduced chance of being scanned by npcs get them into highsec to use during missionsmining to increase dpsyield
so what happns if i die in the middle of war in my 500 million dollar ship my ship is suddenly out for grabs what is a cap pilot uses it what is a titan pilot dies would be awesome though
thisnot supported at all i use boosters for almost every one of my ships your proposal would make them mandatory to competehowever im all for making the gas clouds and bpcs easier to obtain in low sec
i know its not popular to introduce new skills i dont like them either but the core proposal would be better if theres a skill that shortens the detox time instead of making detox boosters the reason is simple  detox boosters will be always used why make them when you can add a new skillotherwise the core proposal is actually good supported
good idea also i would like to a better access to cosmos ladars gaz is the main problem when you live in alliance you have to deal with many red standings to go through other cosmos regions its too hard for an indy booster producer to get nebulaes access theres not enough cyto ladar available so make the ladar with random gazeso7
people dont stay forever in a corp usually but the enter some bpos which they owned themselfswell if there is an arguement or the ceo decides to kill the corp one will loose his bpo cause of the override to unlock the bposo just introduce a private lockdown where you place a bpo into the corphangar and only you can unlock it again
not supported in this form since it would be more logical to revamp the whole thing and allow players to start industrial jobs from their personal hangars instead of corp hangars if the player have appropriate roles ofc
well no problem to me would achieve the same thing so if you have a bpo in the privat hanger of the hq you can right click it and give production rights to the corp the bpo will be locked as it needs to stay at the same station but a simple withdraw corp rights unlocks it
corp theft doesnt need to be nerfed not supported
no it just is too quick and easy to skill it to be good other bcs need a lot more sps invested to make them good ie you not need to skill for t2 missiles to make them great other bcs weapons systems you should be t2 or youre just as well off in a blackbird being useful
im sure 90 of people who want drake nerfed have never actually flown them even in small 1520 gangs most of sub bs targets pop before your missiles reach it what to do shoot secondary thats splitting damage a highly undesirable phenomenon in a fleet what the hell for do you engage drakes at 75 km send cloaked covops at 5 km from them warp to him and see who wins or just have ceptors in a fleet who will orbit battlefield at 200 and warp primaried target to him in this case drakes will to 0 dps to you stop eft warrioring and understand that eft stats dont show real dps large amount of missile dps is wasted in the space without doing any damage at all missiles need time to hit their targets and higher damage at a range is compensation for that im not saying here that drakes suck but people who built passive drake in eft are now talking like its some i win button which its notby the way it would be a good thing to introduce missile disruptors together with missile enhancers
your post is not creative  its a rant because of the tactics that was most likely used against you with success first we see armor hacs are overpowered  nerf them then drakes are overpowered  nerf them if a fleet of 100 rifters was assembled and some good fc made it work you would cry about riftersalso 90 of your op was in form of a question thats not a well structured suggestion that shows how drakes are overpowered with detailed performance comparison with other same level battlecruisers a suggestion how to solve it and with included pros and cons of the changeon a more personal note in solo pvp a hurricane or even a cyclone can and will kill a drake if using the right tactics the drake is not overpoweredo
sending info on why somebody was banned ie what the supposedly did is not sending them how we find outsupported for openess and transparency
you have been banned for rmt abusing a glitch griefing noobs ect is fine
all npc bounties rather than pay directly into a characters account instead become a lootable credit note that spawns in a wreckthis credit note can then be converted to isk at an appropriate npc station that is hostile to the npc that the note came from possibly also player outpostscorporate tax would be taken at the conversion stageresult and purpose of this change would be to make eve more like other sandbox pvp mmorpgs that traditionally have pve produce gold which that can then be taken by force via pvp making pvppiracy more profitable currently its mostly just an isk sink activity in eve and pve more risky
god no please no not everas a 00 ratter i really do not want this to happen ever you have any idea how slow bscarriers are and then i would need to move those tags or whichever to the correct boring highsec space toonot supported
im not supporting this abortion of an idea first you are paid the bounty for destroying the hostile vessel it doesnt make sense for you to loot some rediculous credit notes from the wreck second it would make an already repetative activity even more boring for no good reason and force people to do huge amounts of unnecessary traveling horrible idea i dont get your pvp argument either pvp is profitable if you are good at it or hunt pve ships currently you can take stuff by force and a pve ship wont stand a chance against a pvp ship that kind of pvp will be always profitable and i dont see a reason to boost that in normal pvp most people will still lose money even after your change i also dont see how it would alter pve in any significant way to be more dangerous you already lose almost all engagements against pvp ships and pvpers will always try to kill you when they can it already is dangerous or perfectly safe and your idea doesnt alter that in a significant way it just makes pveing even more bring and cumbersome than it needs to be
this does not make sense either in character or as a game mechanic while i agree that piracy could do with a buff in principle i rarely yarr this wont work
killing ratters is not pvp it sjust killing a ratter
oh god it would be like doing tag missions all the timenot supported
no
then move to wormhole space and enjoy your game since this is a sandbox every player can choose how to play his game thus you have two options  sleepers and regular ratsnot supportededit forgot about drone regions that are available in known space if you dont want to live in wspace
supported for highsec missions since the loot nerf missionbears lose almost none of their potential isk to loot thieves except in missions against npc factions that drop tags this would essentially extend the tag system to all highsec npcs
to play devils advocate for a moment this could be implemented as looting something off the wreck that proves the rat was killed like say the pilots body deadspace overseers personal effects already work in this manner that would make more sense lorewisethat said not supported rat bounties should stay as they are

urban camo makes a tiny tiny bit of sense jungle camo desert camo who greenlighted these hideous concepts to begin with if you want camouflage for a starship make it a death black shroud with a few randomized sparklies if you want to show us its t2 faction or whatever then give us something super ornate and pretty to look at  for example anybody remember the scrollwork and detailing on the gold magnate
indeed didnt we tell them this and they didnt listen when they redid the navy mega
my ship cant be detected while i hide in that bushes over there because i have camo painted shipoh wait there are no bushes
lawl im sure ccp get a lot of reports of players accusing the other side of having an unfair advantage investigating something like that would be time consuming and theres no reason to allocate resources on the word of some players with a clear agenda and no proof
no no no i am not against the escalation solution but if the junior gm closes and continues to close petitions related to a problem then it is practically impossible to get in tuch with a senior gmi did not refuse nor did i suggest that people should refuse to use escalations andor csm to solve seemingly unsolvable problems you failed to understand the issue perhaps i am not being clear enough but if you think the issue is one that can be solved by escalations and csm then you are missing my pointhere is an example some guy is sitting in a system doing whatever he is keeping an eye on local maybe cause he once lost a ship by not doing sowith no one in local apart from himself a ship appears next to him lights a cyno and voilUFFFD he is deadnow from what i gather the gms and just about everyone else is content to drone mindlessly he can just fraps it for proof otherwise lol in effect people are telling this hypothetical person that he should run fraps and record each and every single second of game time just in case someone decides to breach the eula and abuse bugs or featuresthat is not realistic and it is a fair placement of the burden of proof  this is the problem i am trying to raise as an issuenow the blind csm fanboys might not get it but to them one can easily raise another issue related to their favorite cry of proof even if someone recorded fraps or a similar visual record and even if people took screenshots it is possible to manipulate such evidence so if ccp decided to accept evidence from other players as proof they risk becoming easily manipulated judgesand that is why i am suggesting something like an overhaul of the whole gmpetition process before rising volumes squeeze the last remnants of fair out of the rotting carcassagain mr venkul mul i am not interested in discussing the particulars of the alleged cheating i was not there sleepmode when they blew his ship up i was using the circumstances surrounding the petitionrefusal to raise an issue that i believe is universal and affect all types of petitions ccp have shifted the burden of proof on to the customers and increasingly make use of the close button to rid themselves of problems that require an actual effort to solve in the case of abecirkel the gm in question should have handled the complaint as a witness statement and added it to the already large pile of similar accusations made against this particular playernaturally the petition system as a while receives petitions that need to be ignored arguing that some of them should be closed without investigating due to their time consuming nature is not really a proper or intelligent suggestionif i spot something i know to be erroneous behaviour i am armed with a multitude of choices bug report petitions and community guides can help me establish what i am looking at and where i should go with itif a tcu is vulnerable when it should not be i can raise the issue and help a gm investigate by providing further information as needed if the gm simply refuses on the grounds that no proof was given other than a statement about a vulnerable tcu then the problem wont be investigated verified or cast aside nor will ccp get to gather further information instead they are likely to perpetuate a culture among their underling gms that such petitions can be ignored
by the way as far as ccp ignoring stuff on the basis of manipulating evidence goes i am pretty sure that only applies to things like reimbursing player ships if its to illustrate a bug or something their bug reports seem to readily accept and encourage supplying them with screenshot or video evidence whenever its relevent
mazzilliu as a csm i think you should let this one go to some of the other csms it doesnt matter how valid your points may be but you have a tag on you that places you on the exploiters team it would be professional to leave as fact is that you may not be 100 objectivepoint of this whole thing is that said person has been exploiting before banned for 3 months thats what i heard anyways he comes back online he uses the exact same exploit or at least doing whatever hes doing to do the same disapear from local and gms wont even check up on it by rules a person that has already been banned doesnt have that many rights in this game but it looks like this guy hasi know that there was no recorded proof but honestly after a guy has already exploited the game that many times it shouldnt be needed for us gamers to hunt him around eve trying to get proof it would have taken a gm two secons to spawn himself one system from him jump in see that hes ratting but not in local end of storyits just sad that some people hunt for holes in the game to exploit it to its fullest even more sad ccp doesnt fix said exploits or at least perma ban ppl that does usemake thembtw i asked to get my petitions escalated but i havent heard a single thing on my petitions since then it just went silent and times out
mazzilliu you just illustrated one of our points the faith in the system and especially the csmUFFFDs is seriously failing by your meddlingyou have just disqualified yourself by even posting since youre not unbiased you even try to ridicule our complaints you are supposed to be the player communitys championsbut by your actions you just prove one of our points 
perhaps if these witness accounts were more dependable and impartial they would be better regarded because frankly players have demonstrated as a whole that they cannot be trusted to remain a neutral commentator or whistle blower or divorce self interest from what may be a legitimate claim regarding actual bugs or exploits in short they madthis is aside from the track record ccp has thus far in dealing with supposed and real exploits the policy of silence and of punishing the whistle blower has only negative consequences for the game and its community
lawl abecirkel good one
tdlr those meanies in pl killed my macro raven now my but hurts bad
nnnnnnnooooooooooi will never forget the awesome stuff we did in iceland you should post that video where we protested microtransactions in front of parliament seriously funny stuff i am glad to have met you and it makes me sad that it might be the last time i see youyou should seriously consider keeping at least one character though just in case you change your mind over the months or years and decide you want to come back i mean the isk you get from selling your chars will do no good for you anyways
a lot and i mean a lot of empire people want to pew pew in lo they also want to be able to ratmission back up their sec status quicklymake agression security hits less onerous much less same with ship kills raise the hit for pod kills though lower the gcc some and make it more accuratethis alone will generate a lot more losuck activity
perfectly true but vuk position space holding alliance are poor is as much speculative has mine if an alliance hold space only for its strategic value there are 2 options1 it keep it because it protect its money making area and so arguably the alliance get a positive wallet for doing that2 the alliance get a positive return that is not linked to isk ie they are only interested in combat pvp and they dont care because they get their isk another way there is the third option they are incapable of doing 22 and continue to spend isk they cant afford to do somethink the dont like but then they arent a well managed alliance and will die fast honestly can you give me a reason to keep sovereignty in the 00 area if  you dont get isk ratting you dont build capitalssupercapitals you dont mineyou can do it for love of pvp but i dont see the need for sovereignty in that situation especially the costly stuff like cynojammer and cynobridges edityes they can be holding sovereignty hoping to get the positive isk inflow later as all the starting alliancescorporations do but using only the starting alliances as the metrics for alliance riches is like using drake pilots with a month in game as the metrics for level 4 mission runners
i initially wrote wall of text but then i realized its extremely inconsistent and would proly be boring to majority of you guys if there are people who are interested i am more then happy to organize the roundtable or podcast or whatever we found appropriate for the number of people who are willing to participate in the discussion especially cause there was so much stuff going behind the curtains of the new eden i think its finally time to start unveiling some of them anyway i will open a new thread for that back to the topic if put certain alliances aside where their income if coming mostly tru either hordes of macro pets or just pets or tru people dumping load of rl money into game via rmt andor gtcs white noise as current example we have alliances whose income is coming from eula and tos complied sourcesi am pretty sure that if someone mention rich 00 alliances  bob it now or morsus mihi will be the first 2 coming to your mind i am willing to share with you information that will easily beat any of your arguments about 00 being huge isk generator and 00 alliances being filthy rich to the point they are breaking the game anyway as i will be extremely busy in rl for the next couple of days i would appreciate if you guys will drop some ideas how we can organize the roundtable maybe for next weekend and if someone wants to step up and to help me directly with it i could even make them on regular basis maybe biweekly and i will make sure to invite other alliance leaders to participate as welledit sorry for grammarspelling mistakes i am in between the meetings
in real terms account sharing will only get you in trouble if it causes an issue that leads to a petition where ccp have to act someone skilling for you on occasion or even quietly borrowing the account for a session or whatever isnt going to automatically get you banned obviously this isnt an official statement
its a pragmatic one though look at the simple logistics of the situation while im sure ccp logs the ip addresses that people use to sign in so what someone with a dynamic ip or who logs on from the road on business trips or whatever isnt exactly going to catch a whack of the banhammer same for someone whose brother in a different city signs on and swaps skills while the person who owns the account is on deployment in iraq or visiting thai brothels or whatever and if someone is living in your home and using your account there is pretty much no way ccp will ever know unless of course someone does something really really stupid so the no account sharing rule is there to bust people who cause problems for ccp by sharing their account with people who then go and do bad stuffits also a tax on stupidity which is good
you can even discuss how to improve the petition process for issues that do not immediately fit standardized solutionsbefore discussing you may want to consider the qualifications and biases of each csm member and remove any conflicts of interest from the room
top thread to the topplease make pos less of a pita to use
i absolutely support this concord shouldnt give suicideers insurance it doesnt make sense im not antisuicidegank im not even procarebear this idea just makes too much sense not to support
signed ccp wise up and fix some old bugs which clearly this is
i say absolutely no while cosmetic only sounds innocent i have two concerns1 the first thing ccp mentioned after saying cosmetic only was remapping that is not cosmetic it allows faster training  derrrr2 once you open something like this up it mushrooms looks at taxes when the first tax hit am sure most people said something like oh its not too bad  its only a penny on the dollar and now look at taxesi already see people making additional plex for stuff suggestions such as painting our ships etc while that one is at least cosmetic only you know it wont stop theream sure many will disagree but am trying to look at the longterm as i care about the game
nobasically the problem with this on the part of ccp is that they are looking at this as money ccp is not generating enough money to develop content pay rent or buy pizza i think ccp should fix what is wrong with this game rather than trying to patch their money hole with crap like this the reason why ccp is not generating enough money to support operations is the player base is not growing sufficiently this is evident by the recent offers for second account activation at a discount for active players the current model is that new players give eve a try then quit weeks to months laterwhybecause there are sever things broke within eve for new players to get hooked gank in hi seclearning skills to learn skills faster is lame for new playersthe overall lack of trust in the community  scamsthe time it takes to train for anything decent to fly is prohibitively long to the average adhd youthbasically most of the rants on the new to eve forum that have been recycled over and over are a concern to the growth of the player base try giving in to some of the more protective aspects of the new players so they are here long enough to get hooked why ccp has done a good job of hooking the players that have the fortitude for investment over the long term the available market for others who have similar staying power is rapidly shrinking lets face it how many potential players do you know personally that are willing to spend 6 months learning how to fly a digital space ship into pvppve interactions one two thats the extent of people i know and i invited them to play to grow the player base yes they still play the game too do your part and help grow the player base so ccp wont need to resort to microtransactions to fund the pizza partiesotherwise ccp will be required to make changes to fund the basic operations of the companythese may include microtransactions low sp  gank proof 10 systems that new player start in and wh into the real eve after completing the tutorials increasing the monthly cost of the game bad idea change the initial skill set to include many of the learning skill already complete andor sell the game to a publisher that will not care about the community over profits etcccp has indicated that they need and are willing to do something to increase their revenue for profitsliabilities we need to do something as a community that helps maintain the player base so ccp is less stressed to execute a bad idea for every scamgankblob that causes a player to quit playing ccp is that much closer to making microtransactions a reality
i am totally supporting this i think the fourth bonus should be in relation to the fourth bonus on the heavy assault ship counterpartvagabond gets a bonus to max velocity so make the jaguar get a bonus to max velocitymunnin gets a bonus to tracking give the wolf a tracking bonus  it has no webishtar gets a bonus to drone damage and hitpoints give this to the ishkur you may think its overkill so maybe just the damage bonus i guessenyo i guess would get a bonus to mwd capacitorthe hawks current shield boosting bonus does not relate to the cerberus i would suggest giving the hawk a rof bonus like the cerbthe harpy is missing a bonus to shield resistancesthe retribution is missing a rof bonus and a midslot if it please ya the midslot i guess doesnt matter as much if ccp wont fix itthe vengeance is missing a rof bonusthis wont make them overpowered only better ships

oh yeah i support this

oh you were serious mah bad
like i said care to elaborate
i am not supporting this i dont fly gallente but ive been butted by them before blasters have high damage and low range thats how it is gallente get drones man the ishkur for example yes blaster may get kited by a jaguar but the drones will still do dps to a jaginty who orbits past 20k ishtar same ing thing if you want longer range on your guns so bad use railguns im sure hawk and vengeance pilots wish they had 5 light drones to field every ship has a problem every ship has strengths
i am sure that the rest of the gal frig lineup also wishes they had 5 drones i am also sure that the rest of the gal cruiser lineup wishes it had 125mb of bonused dronesor are you suggesting that we leave blasters alone and just give all gal boats large amounts of bonused drones
no im saying gallente are fine as it is if you dont like the enyo dont fly it simple as plenty of people use those ships with success
so then why did you try and justify gal boats being fine because of drone in the first place again
great proposal
defo supported man too many assault ships around not enough minihugginns
i support thisi love flying frigate hulls and ive always wanted to find some use for the skill points i have invested in eafs
this issue was passed 53 and will be presented to ccp
id like to thank deidre for spending a considerable amount of time with me refining the concept and clarifying some ambiguitiesthanks also to the people in this thread who supported and critiqued the ideaand finally props to ed from hr for taking the first steps towards improving his education
i like the second proposal more which means i like it in the first place supported
i like the second proposal too if this gets enough support ill raise it
i like this idea of a compare tool would make life a lot easieras long as ccp doesnt screw up the implementation which it almost invariably will
good idea supporting
both i support
support for the 2nd onei have something else in mind for the 1st proposal but i cant really explain it as i want to 
second proposal supported
i dont support this not only will it create more lag wont it but it is also unrealistic to have big long engine trails on a ship if i am wrong by all means reply to me so i may support this topic

tldr add a 75 range bonus to the legion offensive  covert reconfiguration to bring it on par with the 5 increase in rof or damage provided by other covert ops pilotsill admit it this is a whine for a buff but i think its warranted lets take a look at the various covert ops subsystems available to our tech3 pilotsloki 5 rof adds an extra 333 dps by turning 5 effective turrets into 666 no additional capacitor consumption from higher roftengu 5 rof see loki proteus 5 damage straight 5 increase turns 5 turrets into 625 again no additional capacitor consumptionlegion 10 capacitor use per level no affect on damage whatsoever 5 turrets  5 effective turretsyou could argue that the legions bonus would allow it to use higher grade crystals and do more damageexcept it ignores why people use lowergrade crystals in the first place rangegive the covert legion a second bonus in the style of an apocalypse to increase its optimal range it does not have to be as strong as the liquid crystal subsystem  even a 5 bonus would be enough to make us want to put lasers on our covert legions instead of the monstrosities that autocannons became during the projectile buffas a personal opinion i think it should receive a 75 bonus to stylistically mirror the apocalypse this would let the covert legion use xray where it previously used standard achieving a 25 damage increase  identical to the proteus and inferior to both the tengu and loki this tradeoff is of course only valid where the user can trade range for more damage  if the pilot is already using multifrequency theres not much to be done this is stylistically interesting balanced and differentiates the amarr covert ops from its competitorsif people feel that strongly that two bonuses isnt justified for a covert ops ship then simply swap the capacitor use bonus for a range bonus and stick us with the higher cap drain or provide a only a 5 range bonus and reduce the capacitor reduction bonus to 5 as well id just like them to remember that the tengu and loki get a 33 damage increase and they dont have to pay any capacitor to fire their guns and they have selectable damage types and that they either have superior tracking or ignore it entirelyhowever something must be done because the current state of affairs is ridiculous if minmatar pilots were dealing 7580 of their hybrid and laser brethren they wouldnt have been yelling on the forums about it theyd be storming iceland with 200mmvulcan autocannons crafted from chicken wire and duct tape but thats precisely what is happening with the legion covert subsystem and apparently its okay because its not a combat ship in that configurationfight for our freedom amarrian brethren throw off the shackles of our capacitor reduction bonuses revolt

amen one of the reasons i am leaning away from legion is lack of this balancing factor this would make it a contender again in my mind

how does 5 rof per level  5  333 increase in dps ignoring drones
the covops system on the legion really does need a little boost so yes
to those who claim that you dont have to train learning skills that instead of minmaxing you should just have funi would respond that you dont have to fit your ships correctly that you can just undock in a fail fit and let me pop you and just have funif you are the type of person who would rather win a pvp encounter than lose and you plan on playing eve longer than 6 months you must train your learning skills first to do otherwise is as stupid as getting into a fight with a failfitget rid of training skills and put the sp spent into a pool you can assign to other skills
i agreedo not forget that new players receive a 100 bonus to training up to 15 mil sp if you calculate a compensation for older players to spend points then this should be taken into account also most of us used this bonus to ramp up learning skills this means that i lost out on faster leaning of fun stuff 3 mil sp for the learning tree and 15 mil was at 100 bonus then the compensation should be 375 mil sp to spend on whatever we want 5 mil if you feel generous for the cost of the advanced books 3 mil sp for new players and remove the 100 bonus
welp not that ive used the software in nearly a decade but my degree was in cgi and yeah deviantart screwed up badlyvery saddening
1 this was a an epic failwhile browsing content i feared that there are way more than 15 designs that are worthy of winning and after i saw da semifinal list i was like wtf really there are max 2 designs that are ok others are some bullcrap that wont
holy mother of bad sportsmanship guysdesign i liked  i made didnt win so clearly the whole thing was rigged and the judges were idiots and we should go it overnot supported
absolutely 100 supported
summary of blogmore fluff and bullcrap apparently a simple logo on your ship could disqualify you and this was just one of her many fail misinterpretations of the contest rules so she gives a myriad of other reasons why all the cool ships were disqualified and the really crappy ones were chosen however after reviewing the crappy top 15 again i have seen that some dont follow her own strict misinterpreted set of contest rules fail the bottom line is they feel they know art better than us they chose a bunch of crap ships and now are coming up with lame excuses as to why its this way i guarantee you if ccp artists had been judging they would have chosen a top15 of nothing but the best best evelike ships best drawn ships best art everything deviantart sucks at judging plain and simple and i still feel that truly were extremely lazy in choosing the top15 and simply chosen out of the most recent submissions this danielle person writing these blogs is on such a high horse she needs to just admit they are way too incompetent to truly pick a top15 for such a great game as eve and that their sense of art for spaceships is wayy off and she needs to admit that ccp needs to take the whole contest over and pick a new top15 cus deviantart sure as heck cant do it right
signedsupportedrejudge it ccp
it needs to happen you want a pr disaster let any of the final fifteen make it into the game ive already stated publicly that id hunt these ships if ccp lets these 15 go through it flys in the face of everything theyve said concerning incarna over the past year and why theyre doing what theyre doing with incursion to boot there are so many entries that should be there and arent only 3 of the 15 are game worthy only 2 of them are able to be made if we do what you suggest you get two minmatar ships thats it and they arent a new type of ship either i voice my overall support for something being done it has to be drastic and it has to get das attentionthis was in das latest statement on the situation and that tells me all i need to know experts id be surprised to find if one judge even played and even on artistic grounds the 15 that were chosen were not even close to being the top 15 submitted speaking as someone whos debated this on gen discussion im ed generally and i hope ccp takes real action here there were several submissions one of which da has pulled down because of its comparison to the others that have been fully ignored for whatever reason despite their qualitynow i must take issue with one thing the  and vinegar being thrown at the artists in question one of the artists in question left da for good others are getting bombarded players who are doing this need to stop they created what they would want in the game there are technical and in some cases artistic reasons why they shouldnt be in the 15 but none of them show a lack of talent or some of the other things that have been thrown around i personally didnt put an entry in because i would have ran into the same problem as the peregrine which has been pulled down by da id have gone for more than 6 pictures and the time involved for me to make it was prohibitive there does need to be a change and these 15 chosen should have at least some compensation for the storm that has erupted on them it is a storm entirely of someone elses making i do protest the obvious ripoffs and i do protest the non racial ships but i will not make a personal attack on these artists and you shouldnt either as an artist everything we do is subjective it is entirely up to the person looking at it to determine what they believe we try our damnedest but in the end its the person who looks at it that makes the decision ccp stop this before it jumps off the tracks please do not force players to take extreme measures in the existence of one of these semifinalists in the game rejudge this contest yourselves and get a proper set of ships in game
supportedto the deviantart artistsi have enjoyed perusing your art there are many talented people of varying levels of skill displaying their art therei wish you all the best and hope you understand that most of the comments i and others have left are directed primarily at deviantart mangers judges and should not be taken as an attack on you the artiststo deviantart managementi will shortly be cancelling my account never to return this is my albeit small protest at what i consider to be an utter mockery of a contestthe judging of this contest was a joke not to mention an open insult to the artists themselves failure to accurately describe or clarify the rules was unprofessional failure to apply those rules equally is unforgivablethis entire competition has been a shining example of poor organisation suspicious judging and truly offensive public relationsto ccpi sincerely hope this experience has not damaged the possibility of similar competitions in the future there is a wealth of talented people who would love to see their dream ship added to the game and i feel eve could benefit greatly from this should you ccp decide to hold this type of competition again please consider hosting judging it internally so as to insure that both the organisers and judges are competent to make the necessary decisions as it appears that regardless of how professional the judges at da may be in this particular case i would in no way consider them competentpeace

dont know if any one else has brought this up but it would be nice if ccp would give us skill books to help with reload time cause there are skill books for lock time range rate but not reload which just kinda seems lop sided
dont fix whats not brokeni dont see the point in it to be honest
supportedlast september i started a thread here for some ideas to revamp the booster system not sure if op saw it but lots of similar ideasto those saying no you cant argue that boosters arent used enough just because you use them a lot doesnt mean they are used in the amount ccp desired upon implementation a more dynamic system than the current one addiction mechanics etc would help breathe life into boostersalso a lot of you may not like this but i personally believe that all booster related stuff should be moved to low sec except mykoserin keep that in high sec give boosters the boost they need and make the gasbpcs more available and you might see more than 1 of the eve population using them
not supported leave the taking and usage of boosters as is the penaltyreward for consuming boosters is perfectly fine
yes more drugs please
a topic says it allthose skills takes a lot of time to lvl v its not a problem but there is almos no point to do that except for some refineriesits just seems not rightmaybe a solution for this is to do something with refineries so only with all affecting v its will be no wastealso subsystem construction skills have a same problem afaik
simple solution to that and make mining more worthwhile downgrade the empire stations refinery efficiency from 50 to 33 i picked a random 33
or you could you know just not train them if you dont need them just because a skill exists doesnt mean you have to train it you know
exactly
someone has never lived out of a pos tower before
what this is madness
high skill reqs differen sub systems and an appropriate price tag would make it practical
one idea specialized exploration ship i dont like the t3 cruiser configs1 special high slot which takes a specialized module this module has codebreaker analyzer and salvager combined this ship would be the only ship that can fit the module cruiser or battlecruisersize hull comparable dps to those 6 hi slots 1 for specialized mod 1 probe launcher 4 weaponsfew mid and low 34 of both this ship should be made in a way so it doesnt do too well in pvpbonuses to salvage codebreaker and analyzer chance of success 5 per level trained
maybe we should fix the problems with the current t3 cruisers before introducing more potentially broken stuff although i would like to see more t3 ships frigatesdestroyers especially
the problem is the whole game needs to be fixed and ccps track record shows that in 5 years they might fix something that was broken 7 years agothey need to strike a balance between fixing issues and introducing new content seems like they are doing neither right now not at a decent pace anyway
well since the only real reason to train destroyers 5 right now is light interdictors or if you happen to be a destroyer enthusiast and that we have several dozen frigate hulls as it iswhy not t3 destroyers middle ground between frigates and cruisers price wiseperformance wise and a new reason to train destroyers 5 i have no idea as to bonuses skills etc but this seems reasonable to me
cool story broseriously i think a blend of t2 and t3 may get us there faster there are subsystem slots available in the ship fitting screen for every ship but not active why not allow t2 ships to be upgraded with t3 subsystems this can work similar to the rig slots but removable there would need to be a limit of the available space for subsystems to make sure its not too op like rigs this will allow for a massive content and customization increase in the game wo the need for new graphics or new ship types after that i will be crying for new ship types like everyone else
at one point they had t3 425mm railguns and i think 1400mm arty in the unpublished section of the db sisi not sure if that is still there but iirc it gave an increase to shield hp flat amount not and had ever so slightly different dmg or range base stats perhaps that was just to make the crystal ball gazers go crazy with speculation though v0vi agree that t3 frigs would be pretty dumb insofar as the market is already saturated with unused ships in that hull size if however they made all t2 frigs t3 in nature ditching all the current hulls it might be viablethough i imagine a lot of current producers would be ed about this
drake is better
we all know that there are many posts on how to fix the perceived problems with learning skills this is a different take on the issue specifically how to increase the attraction of the learning skills to players i propose that a new skill be introduced into the game that when trained provides unspent skill points to the player call it over achiever or something like that the way it would work is to have 5 10 15 20 and 25 of the skill points generated learning anything to be awarded to the player as unspent sp take for instance you want to lean forum trolling v which is 1000000 sp obviously an easy skill because everyone thinks they have it learnedif you have over achiever to level v then after learning forum trolling v you would be awarded 250000 unspent skill points the points would be calculated daily and awarded during downtime but only after completing the skill learning processthe oa skill should be hefty on learning 8x and cost massive isk to get prerequisitesall basic learning skills to vall advanced learning skills to ivlearning vthis may generate excitement in the learning skills once more for getting them up quickly and eliminate the groaning for elimination of the skill tree all together wo the oa skill the skill tree will become history fast from all the ing on the forums thoughts forum trolling v players
might as well support my own idea
at least its a new idea
i like it in so far as to say maybewhat about those who have 60 mil sp this is not going to mean a damn thing to themnot that they care or do they
im new to eve and hate the learning skill treei like this idea
there are good ways to get rid of learning skills remove them refund everyones sp increase base attributes by 10 or sothis isnt one of them it doesnt help players in any way to get over the tedious process of learning skills that only remove fun from the game even worse since you made it expensive it mainly helps alts and older players newer players dont get anything
the point is not to get rid of them and keep the game we know intact a blanket 10 to all players is not keeping with the core mechanics of the game system if isk is a problem then just lower it until its reasonable for newish playersno its not for the very new players but it makes learning more of a game mechanic and not a grind tech iii learning if you must have it described differently
the core mechanics of the game are you fly spaceships your character trains skills in real time to level out the playing field between the timerich and timepoor as far as character development goesawarding free sp for gaining sp is not any more or less in keeping with the game mechanics than removing the learning skills altogether
weve got an interesting problem here ccp has fundamentally declared player owned stations to be a corporationgrade asset however you cant do anything useful with a blueprint a private asset without tower to research it ini mean sure you could use those nasty npc stationseven gasp going to lowsec if prices got too high butthats not as efficienthrm maybe theres a cost to that efficiency ahh right  the difficulties that go into fueling defending and maintaining a player owned station from both outsiders and insiderstldr corp theft is fine i want more tears over stolen bpos in my login screen
lets think about this for a minyou could deny the loan to the corp and foster some power through need they need you to manufacturer items that only you have the bpo to get it done this inturn gives you power and sway in the corp directly dependent on the level and use of the bpo you dont need to be a douche about the bpo and use it like a tool that never works out in the end best advice is to do your best to manufacture the hell out of what the corp needs so they rely on you if you have a disagreement with some other corporate members at some point in the future the corp will take into account your usefulness in making a decision to settle the dispute if youre not a douche then the corp will favor a reasonable decision if you are a pita then you lose with no power come no responsibility keep the power close and use it well
proposal passed 750 with some items deleted of which some may be reraised as specific proposals
a good addition to the game would be the ability to trade a plex card for a new paint job on you ship i would suggest the followingone plex would equal 20 paint job points we will call this pj points for short sofrigate  1 pj pointsdestroyer  2cruiser  4battle cruiser  6battleship  10carrierdreadnought  20titansuppercarrier  50now the different paint jobs could have tiers you need to unlock to get to the better and better pjs so lets say a blood raiders pj would be like a tier 6 or something each tier requires a certain amount of pj points to be spent to unlock it
another topic about a microtransactions dont care 
microtransactions in this game shouldnt exist at all plex is okay because it turns into game time but using plex for anything else shouldnt happen
the issue isnt drakes its armor hac fleets and their overpowered logisticswith sig and speed tanking ahacs are immune to anything a sniper or rr bs fleet can do and will  them into the ground with a massive buffer tank ahacs are easily repped by overpowered guardians which are amazing cap stable and unjammable with some cap transfers and eccm the massive repping power of guardians bonuses of damnations and lokis the ahac fleet will destroy bs fleetsthis is where the drake comes in a fleet of drakes supported by scims basilisks and assorted ewar a large number of drakes is a viable counter to an ahac fleet heavy missiles will hit webbedtpd zealots sniper or rr bses will have no trouble shooting drakes and a large bs fleet would probably destroy drakes especially if they were fit for sniping as drakes wouldnt hit that far so why not use a sniper bs fleet to kill a drake blob because someone will then drop an ahac fleet on your bs fleet and destroy youits become a silly rockpaperscissors with drakesahacsbsdrakessolution nerf logistics  reduce base sensor strength and the bonuses applied to cap transfers

the drake is as overpowered for bc fleets as the vagabond is overpowered for hitandrun hacs as the sabre is for dictors as the rupture is for t1 cruisers as the maelstrom is for alphastriking as the vigil is for fast tackle

if you call that documentation then there are no problem in my dictionary thismean that much more than you are a rmter it is interesting how you are playing dumb about the difference between documentation on why ppl get banned and explanation on why ppl get banned the former require some kind of proof the latter simply a clear accusation this is an acceptable request the op isnt
i totally support this idea you dont have to give exact detail for what have done to make sure you worth a ban but you still have to give a basic reasonrmt macro etc so that people who clearly did not done anything wrong is able to clear their name however if ccp want to add another c infront of their name then there is notthing we could do about iti do agree that the op need to change the words slightly so that ccp wont get all fuzzy on the idea

this is the right of players
sov grinds are already boring enough no need to make the hp sinks a bigger waste of timei would support this if1 structures had 0 resistance without an enemy fleet present so an unopposed structure would be dead this would only be problematic during the first rf cycle of a structure when a surprise attack could rf something very quickly once a timer is up someone will have time to repair if people could cloak up caps in a safespot and get 80 resists it would be stupidly lame2 the bonus is not applied by ships cloaked docked or inside pos shields but uncloaked and in system perhaps lesser bonuses if the fleet is not on gridthis is an ok idea but will not encourage a badly outnumbered fleet to show up

well no what we know for a fact is that someone was exploiting whats suggested often as a rationalization is that a nonzero percentage of the sploiters targets were themselves cheating if folks really want to believe that the good white knight cheater was preying on the bad cheaters thats up to them but its not exactly a convincing argument
no what we have is conjecture by groups with their own agenda and interests many of whom arent acting altruistically by any stretch of the imagination or whom will never need proof because the accused has already been tarred and feathered by those they are conceptually speaking in bed with most people seem to take the view that bad people doing bad things to other people in eve is ok as long as all the bad people get punished in the end unfortunately there are rather a lot of bad people that have expended a lot of time and effort trying to look like good people and far more than that number whom are good people that couldnt tell the difference in the first placeccp can be the only body in this game that can be expected to run a proper investigation into an allegation of foul play but for an allegation to have any credibility that would warrant a time consuming investigation there has to be a degree of evidence supporting that there is actually something happening that shouldnt be if players can provide this they should frankly until an entire fleet of 500 starts being invisible in local the suggested problem is a minor one and looks to be limited to individuals that have grown too used to having an infallible unsleeping intel tool at their disposal that would in other games be considered cheating in and of itselffurther repeat occurrences seem to be in extremely limited circumstances effecting limited numbers of players for whom the inconvenience is minor the lack of ready repetition of this phenomenon does not lend support to its existencethis evidence must be impartial either in source of by nature hearsay spewed forth by people opposed in game to a another group accused of wrongdoings is understandably given short thriftwhen ccp does investigate and find no evidence there is any wrongdoing this rarely assuages any self righteous accusers in favor of a witch hunt they have already decided someone is guilty they do not need proof and are quite capable of inventing the most convoluted ans spurious claims to further their chosen fantasy
it have discovered that sometimes the addressbook is bugged and fails to register when pilots have logged off welcome to 2006 pretty sure this revelation doesnt warrant random people being banned for it though
is your claim really that the exploit was duplicated and then the exploit was rapidly patched because ccp didnt know that there was an exploit but only guessed that maybe there might have been one of course it was proven the fact that ccp patched it out of the game shows that there was something that had to be patched out of the game so it takes an entire 500 man fleet if i just follow you around and repeatedly gank you when local tell you youre alone youd be cool with that right and the game ccp themselves designed is now cheating in and of itself and because the proven exploit isnt used on a grand scale we should doubt it even exists at allyou do realize that as rationalizations go those arent very good no that is an absurdity it must be impartial in terms of source youve just creaetd a nifty loophole whereby evidence put forward by absolutely anybody in eve can now be discounted since nobody is totally impartial even objective evidence has to be relayed through a nonobjective source and any evidence is suspect anyways or can i photoshop you into a local chat spewing racial slurs and thatd be cool were left with a confirmed exploit that some folks now want to set standards of proof for which are herculean at best and impossible at worst this is not an effective manner in which to police a games structural integrity quite a different story than a mere addy glitch
and again after saying this kind of platitude you go disproving your words or showing that you are ignorant of the way you should act if the gm refuse to escalate and close the petition you can1 open a new petition with another gm and ask to escalate immediately citing the previous refusal as the reason2 contact directly internal affairs and present a petition against the specific gm for the refusal to escalate beside asking for a senior gm appeal on the starting petition getting in touch with a senior gm is a right the low level gm can say i think it would not be useful to reduce the burden of the senior gms but if requested he cant refuse his refusing would only give more credit to your favoritism accusation the moment you get old of a senior gm or internal affairs if you noticed i didnt say anything about the need of proof on your part even if adding further informations is always helpful i did speak about your apparent refusal to use the tools available to get the petition to someone that would check what can be checked in the logs you always end your posts in the same way there is a constipation we cant do nothing the same gm is always stonewalling our petition i should cry on the forum instead of contacting the proper authorities and that is exactly why people dont care for your message
its a problem if thats the expected path contact gm and ask them to look at the logs which show nothing because the logs are just a magic eight ball but still get stonewalled demand to move up the chain get stonewalled contact ia wait for an investigation etc that seems shall we say excessive
i sympathise with the op and of course everyone on the csm wants to have exploits reported and fixed as soon as possible the problem of course from the gms point of view is that everyone is an unreliable witness playing the devils advocate here the reporter may be lying he may be honestly mistaken the aggressor may be triggering the bug by pure accident and as far as he is concerned you were just afk and he walked right up to you or he might be a filthy exploiterso how is a gm supposed to figure out what is really going on given the limited amount of information available what tools can csm suggest ccp build to help make these decisionsthis is not a simple problem for example a database of complaints against particular characters could be abused by illintentioned complainers resulting in an innocent player being bannedit occurs to me that one thing that might help would be the muchrequested battlerecorder if it recorded the actual packets going to and from the client but even this would have to be turned on in order to catch the action or perhaps something that just logs the packets since the last session changebut even if things like this could be done there is a bangforbuck question  is it worth the time and effort to do this as opposed to devoting it to fixing other parts of the game arguably it might be a good bughunting tool
its strange to say atleast that this keep happening good though that these incidents with 1 or more ppl not showing in local local bug has been all around the eve universe should be a headsup and more to the gm but since it aint thats very strange and makes me kinda scared about where this is goinganyways im only left with 1 acc and thats cause i love the game  but this is going don the drain aswell hopefully the game will catch up again and show worthy of me playing it againgotta say that this is a thing to keep me away from it still
whats strange about it people have been bad at watching local and finding spys since 2003 now they have some big bad exploit to blame their failings on
proof or stfu
the conclusion to this seems pretty selfevident to me from usual experience playing a couple of years and reading csm subforums recently imnsho the majority of petitions with regards to halfway important issues are about as futile as addressing those with the current csm either way hardly any chance of success at bestotoh no reason for a maudlin mood once you realize this you can spend your time in better ways unless of course you do enjoy being trolled for your bothers
tbh i think that the eve community should demand a full investigation on cheatsthere have been a lot of conspiracy theories about the sphere and its functionality for example there have been reports of entire fleets not appearing in local thanks to the sphere were these lies was all the the sphere stuff invented by pl just to flame other players making them saying haxxxxorrzz and laugh i like to think that those sorrounding the power of the sphere are probably just rumors spread by stupid people but those are very spread ones and scaring

notldr good game ccp too bad your killing it alreadyi will most likely be cancelling my subscriptions on incursiun anyways if plex for remaps is implementedi have played bfh and atlantica online and i swore to myself to never accept that crap again not a single dayi know there are already plex for isk and that only works because the isk price is so low 15 only buys 2 average pvp ships and thus you dont really feel a difference between good isk grinders and payers noone pays the 50 to outfit a real pimp ship and if some people do it doesnt affect the rest of us that much because there are only so few of them especially so few of them actually using those ships to pvpso it doesnt matter wether new items would be only of cosmetic natureif they are sellable for isk what i suppose they will they will increase the prize of plex even if you cant buy them for plex but for normal money because than less people will buy plex to get isk but those new items that will and can only lead to a better toisk conversion rate better as in more isk per  thus making it a more viable choice to do what will of course mean that pimpedbyactualmoneyships will have more impact on everydayeve what easily might add up to a point where you will have to pay to stay at the topand while i have no intentions or skills to even get to the top i will not keep paying a single  for a game where great success comes by more rl wealthif i wanted i would still be playing bfhand exactly this will happen with plex for remap it will greatly further the demand for plex which is capped at 1 per monthaccount currently duhand no you cant have my stuff i will keep playing till my isk for plex run out and then i will finally be free again actually that is probably a good thing about plex for remapbut i am sure ccp knows that they even have hired at least one exbfh devwhat is probably happening here is that ccp realises they wont be able to keep getting more subscriptions and thus now reached the point where there concern is no longer to make eve better and bigger and thus earn more money from more players but to begin milking those that are thereits quite a surprise that the very first iteration of this offers an ingameadvantage though i would have expected cosmetic things first then waiting till the new income from that shrinks then add minor advantages give up on those that wont accept that and wait again for everyone to stop buying it followed by less subtle advantages again letting a part of the players go and again milking those that stay and so onactually that is the way most mmos will go once you begin to offer ingame advantages there is no turning back as you will already have lost a number of subscribersi know i sound bitter yet this is the end of eve
noi didnt think they were serious about thisplex for remaps alone is enough to quitediti know noone reads the whole thread and quoting first page is even more uselessbut you are wrong what this changes is the demand right now ccp gets no of subscribers15 everymonth no more no lessallowing plex to be used for anything but game time drives up their prize in isk and thus give people who pay more than 15 a month a bigger advantage than what they get today

besides the fact that they already have 4 bonuses even if we wanted them to have 5 your suggestions dont do squat for balance within the class nor keep things balanced between afs and other classes3kmsab to 5kmsmwd jags wont be balanced350dps ishkurs wont be balanced230dps hawks wont be balancednot to mention you dont give meaningful bonuses to the enyo harpy veng or wolf once you take the major boosts the 3 top afs geti assumed you had actually thought about all this and were just having a laugh because of your last line read trolling like i said mah bad
no assault frigates only get 3 bonuses at the moment i was suggesting the fourth bonus that this topic is proposing anyway maybe my suggestions wouldnt balance the class but i was just giving suggestions for a fourth bonus of the assault ships in relation to the heavy assault ships didnt give a meaningful bonus for the enyo couldnt think of any deimos gets a bonus to mwd cap use so i suggested that for the enyothe sac gets a bonus to missile rof so the veng should too nothe cerberus gets a bonus to missile rof so the hawk should too noim not sure about the wolfs bonus because it was just something from the top of my head but the munnin gets a bonus to tracking as well as two dmg bonuses and a range bonus so figured it made sense
the frigates that af are based on have 10 slots 433 rifter for example af give one more slot to them for a total of 11 slots 443 jag or 524 wolf that actually strips a mid and makes you do a double take if youre used to the rifter experienceall of the af should get an extra slot  make it mid or low 444 jag and 534 wolf give the ships their missing frigate bonus  tracking bonus in the case of the wolf and jag donenow this will obsolete the destroyer class but af and destroyers were competing for the same niche anyways considering how broken destroyers are nothing should be balanced around them anyways
saying this over and over does not make it true nor does someone makeing a thread saying this make it trueif you want to have a boost af thread fine but lets not do it under the false pretense that they are missing the t2 4th bonusfixdand this
eas ships get t2 resists  and its not mentioned as a bonus most t2 ships get the increased resistances wo it being mentioned the af were among the first t2 ships and were experimental i wouldnt mind interceptors getting the t2 resistances to be honestill also make the point that most t2 frigates have been redone  and get a role bonus when all is said and done this is not something where the wheel has to be reinvented slap on an extra mid or low for all af the retribution would have two mids then enyo and wolf three ect slap on the missing frigate bonus make the role bonus the t2 resists  and keep the speed and agility the same  thats more then a fair tradeoff
supported bring back the sniper harpy
you must all be stupid t2 resists arent a fourth bonus the vagabond gets t2 resists as well as a fourth bonus quit being heads assault ships are missing a fourth bonus give it to them interceptors are missing a fourth bonus too the role bonus which gives a 80 reduction in propulsion jamming operation cost is absolutely not a bonus recon ships get 4 bonuses as well as a role bonus quit bullting
afs need some love big time fully supported
if a bonus is not a bonus then what is the definition of a bonus againit seems to me that the only reason why you dont want to consider a role bonus as a bonus is that some ships get 4 regular bonuses and 2 bonuses from roles having a 6 bonus t2 ship several 5 bonus t2 ships and some 4 bonus t2 ships implies that perhaps ccp doesnt beleive that all t2 ships should have the same number of bonuseswhich undermines the geif af the t2 4th bonus argument plain and simple the extra resists an af gets over and above the other t2 ships of its class is the 4th bonus which is why i advocate for ccp putting it back into the description so people dont get confused the eafs also get a higher base resist than other t2 ships and therefore it can be argued have more than 4 bonuses which is fine because not all t2 ships needget the same quantity of bonuses to be balancedme awaits the incoming hahahaha i trollolololol u poast
gold jacket green jacket who gives a happy gilmorei dont care how many bonuses we say af have  the bottom line is that they dont quite work frigates with one or two mids struggle or just plain dont work ships that cost 18 million isk but pop when a cruiser looks their way dont work ships that struggle to track other ships their own class dont work ive plopped down my idea ccp needs to get that  sorted
man the bottom line for me is that the jaguar should be more than 200ms faster than the vagabond the vagabond and the cynabal relate to eachother almost identically so too should the jaguar and dramiel im not saying make the jag as good as the dramiel in every way im just saying make it faster right now it is not fast enough for its reputation as a kitemobile the jag is a minivaga give it some more speed not a lot a littlethe wolf is a gunboat give it a tracking bonusthats the way i see it no need to give both the jag and wolf a tracking bonus
even the enyo gets a drone and has a way better tank than the ishkur brah thorax has more drones than almost every battlecruiser save gallente ones obvs  so stfu thats why i tried to justify them because of drone i didnt mean only ishkur and ishtar the thorax makes up for the lack of drones with dps and tank as does the enyo look im right ok
your not good with consistancy are you
first only drone gallente boats are good ishkur vexor ishtar myrm domi  they have bonuses for drones ishkur has just big drone bandwidth even thorax with his 50m bw is a bad ship vexor has very good chances to defeat thoraxsecond dedicated blaster boats are not good comparing with appropriate tier ship of other races excellent solution ccp please close this thread blaster problem is solved
ive attempted to go through most of the 19 pages here i had an idea and wanted to make sure it hadnt been voiced before i threw it out there first a definition wrecking hits  they do up to 300 of normal damage on a target they depend on a lot of different factors to happen transversal velocity weapon damage type vs target resistances tracking ect double or triple the chance that railguns or blasters get a wrecking hit give blasters a slight tracking boost  say 10 that doesnt look like much but it would increase the chance of a critical hit and give more damage potential this would give hybrids a racial flavor youre wrapping a projectile in a field of some sort and throwing it down range at insane speeds you can visualize such an object going in one end of a ship and out the other it increases damage that hybrids currently can do but it isnt guaranteed  over time youd get higher dps at the same time youre not extending range or making hybrids more lazorlike in order to compete with other races  youre unique
not really wrecking hits happen at 1 chance every shoot and dont affected by transversal or damage typesresistancesbeyond the normal calculations that would only increase damage by 24 in a peek dps situation a bit more in situations you deal less however it is not even close to create a noticeable effect in the end10 tracking is basically a useless change for blasters it would be like adding 1 falloff to acs no it would not
i think part of the problem is that people dont know where hybred turrets should stand in the larger picture everyone has different ideas should they sit somewhere between lasers and projectiles in terms of the range bonuses where should they sit with their ammo and how does one tackle their cost per shotthe comparison i did earlier showed that blasters had about 15 times the optiminal range of the autocannons and 15 times the falloff of the pulse lasers the worst of both worlds in terms of range this does need to be changed and i suggest the midpoint between autocannons and pulse lasers 2x increase in optiminal and a 36 increase in falloff i think this would handle a majority of complaints but it still leaves the issue of cost per shot and their ammo
i threw double or triple out there to simply flesh out the idea if it is a 1 chance for a wrecking hit  what about increasing the chance ten fold to 10 for hybrids and leave the tracking increase as debatable
i am good with consistancies the thorax does have more drones than almost every bc yet it does have a lack of drones when you compare it to say a vexor yet it does make up for this with a huge tank moderatedapplebabe
there was no blaster problem to begin with the ishkur gets drones the enyo gets another turret slot and more tank pick one you nub the vexor gets dronesthe thorax gets a better tank and drones
that would be a 20 dps increase that sounds a lot however even with this you are left with the issues created by qr in general i dont see any real reason to use one without the ability to pin down a target at point blank and hold it perfectly in place for any kind of medium or large blaster ship once you catch it
all of you are forgetting how much cap lasers consume if you guys want a blaster boost your gonna have to increase the cap consumption also
after the cap bonus it is mostly equal also you need far more cap to move the hulls around with the mwd in my experience cap need is actually higher for most gallente hulls under real combat conditions
are you saying the mwds consume more cap when their used with a gallente hull
no but there is a serious difference in the need of mwding around with a optimal of 4511km compared to 1545km in most combat situations

lets take a few examples suppose you cut your cycle time in half a 50 reduction that means youre getting out twice as many shots in the in the same time you double your dpswhat if you cut your cycle time to a third thats a 67 reduction and it triples your dpsnotice the pattern if you get an x percent reduction you get a 11x increase in dps this is why rof is preferred over raw damage increase provided you can pay for it in reload time or capacitor use

the cost of localfirst off thank you for spending the time to examine my proposal as it stands local performs a multitude of tasks and simply works with that said this idea is purely a mechanism to increase the depth of the game and by no means is it a necessity    i propose that null sec systems that do not have an alliance paying the bill to maintain sovereignty lose the attribute of local in said system unclaimed systems will not show players in local unless they choose to send a text transmissionwhy the compromisewith this feature pvpers can get the taste of wh space while carebears can retain the security that comes from having local as an intel source it makes sense to not have local in a system that is not being maintained by an alliance hence the idea of lawless spacedetails a system will lose the local feature if an alliance fails to pay the sov bill removes tcus or if sbus are put in place to contest the sovereignty claim note the actual moment when the local feature is added or removed from a system happens during dtthank you for reading this idea and i look forward to the fruitful feedbackhiero
going to have to say no on this one it is your fault for not playing more by agreeing to the subscription ccp has sold you 30 days to play the game how you play it is up to you
i think the sov system should punish people even further for being dumb enough to participate in the sov warfare grind there should be 12 reinforcement cycles and each structure should have 5x more ehp and randomly aoe jam everyone every 2 minutes this way only the most dedicated will get land to control
i know your trying to troll and doing the worst possible way at it butthis actually is not a bad idea the only way it would work is if all assets and players were moved into low sec then all player made stations removed from the game all done over downtime throw in a new sov system that the csm has not tainted with their idiotic ideas and it would do very well
i assume this is a troll thread since it has to do with sov and was authord by a pl memberbut i agree sov needs work so 1 anyhow

as it stands right now the drake is all that and a bag of chips it can have a great tank great damage great speed great agility and great lock range did i mention it can do all of that and still be able to tackle well it can while many have this assumption that several things need to be done to bring it in line with other tier 2 battle cruisers the answer is very simple only one change needs to be made to balance it reduce the drakes power grid and lock range by 15thats it by doing so a pilot will have to choose between what tributes he wants to be great at so if heshe wanted a good tank good and good damage they can still do that but they will need to use an afterburner instead of a mwd want speed and damage no problem you will just have to sacrifice some tankserious questions and comments and thumbs up welcome the rest can  off
supporting of course another example isyou can still hit 85kms with your hml heavy missile launcher you will just need to use a middle or low slot to extend your lock range
nothe drake is just skirting the powergrid line already needing high skills to fit you can not make a ham drake wo awu already compared to all other teir 2 bc which can be fit with tech 2 weapon and tank at engineering and electronics 45so what you want is to remove the ability to fly one is what your saying because no one will be able to fit it for etheir job your fix will break the one good ship for caldari completely i will support this when they nerf all the other battlecruisers fittingalso how did you lose a dramiel to a badger
while i always think your comments and ideas are always well thought out and in tune with things in this case you could not be more wrongjust because a good portion of a races ships need balancing in no way warrants one ship to be incredibly op over powered i am currently researching the other ships and will present a fix to them when they are readythis business with people thinking i can fly a badger or a dramiel is just silly i love lasers last time i checked caldari and minmitar did not use them although some ships that have split weapons of lasers and misslesprojectile could prove to be effective if the ship had bonuses for both might get me to cross train
lame troll is lame also your topic has been extensively discussed here already
i have to dissagreewith all the nerfing that had gone around its become unfair to the players to nerf them periodstop nerfing ships cause some whiny punk cant fly it proper or someone else flies it better geezzzzzzseriously work on new ships and stop messing the ones that are out already to the point that they suck example vagabonds before they got nerfed they were awesome now theyre just overprices wastes of training
first it is not a troll second that thread is all over the place with no clear idea my thread offers a simple and elegant solution to the problem at hand thirdly back to oranges argument about the tight fit yes it is a really tight fit but that really tight fit gives you everything no other ship gives you great tank damage manuverabiliy lock range and tacklego ahead name one ill waitdidnt think so
hurricane harbinger vegabond zealot armegeddon apoc abbadon tempest typhoon maelstrom nighthawk slepnir absolutionyour powergrid idea will gimp it to much it will die to easily every harbinger hurricane and even myrmidon so now caldari has no good pvp ships great job like you said there are plenty of ideas yours is the worst so far
im sorry i cant agree with thisjust because the drake happens to be be fotm does not mean its op
2 years is hardly flavor of the monthalso lol at those ships listedthe drake is the most used ship three times as much as the hurricane which is second most it is used so much it is more than the ships that came in fifth thru second combinedfotm flavor of the month my ass
and a very large portion of the people who play eve are caldari combine that with thae large number who train them for pve and a healthy dose of name another good tech 1 caldari ship and you get drake numbersalso a lot of people support or would accept a drake rebalence they just happen to hate your idea no one wants that many fitting problems or any other ship to need a rcu at max skillbut hey to test it i put seven ham iis and a mwd i on a max skill drake with 15 powergrid removedengineering ii it went over this is before any kind of tank or dmg mod congrats your drake can not tank or deal dps and that is at max skill so basically  anyone newish player who tries to fly one and you wonder why your the only one who supports your own postsdo some research before posting
your doing it wrong so you are mad because a noob would not be able to do all those things great at the same time sorry to break you the news but a noob should not be able todrone the ballistic control for a rcu reactor control unit and you still get all that epic tank tackle speed agility etc you are just doing a bit less damageyou should use eft eve fitting tool program there is some formulas you are missing and this tool is amazing to help people out
and again drake is fine caldari has their benefits as all othersdrake was already nerfed before release 7 missile slots instead of 8nerf it again and we will have another bc popular as ferox which needs a boost btw but noone caresbtw most of my fittings for this ship requires 5 cpu implant with all v of course
if anything the drake needs an ecm bonus and more midslots
every tier 2 battle cruiser was nerfed a bit before the release i also am wondering what kind of fittings you use requires a 5 implant
well not such a bad idea drake has a good medslots so why not fit all of them in ecm and some armor tankapms in low  its a low priority target so you can jam quite a long time before they sees wtf 
ordinary damage cheap t2 fitting both pvp and pve i dint fly this ship a long ago already but its a nice one 
this and which fc wants to have all race bcs in fleet drakes attract drakes
a proper cane fit will kick a drakes ass its got nearly as good a tank a hell of allot more gank with acs
on the scale of op the drake isnt as bad as the rifter cynabal or dramiel in their respective classes and thus shouldnt be addressed until those are not supported
does this guy realize that the drake is the only tier 2 bc that has to have an pdu to have a good fit edit or a 5 pg implant it would still be a good ship if it had to switch out for a rcu but that would be retarted
a fine this to thati fly gallente and even i dont see why the drake should be nerved but buffing blasters a bit well now were talking
dude chill eat more fiberas to the op drake is fine leave it alonenext
this thread deserves a more serious responsethe changes ccp made to the game mechanics in dominion have resulted in a trend toward smaller sig ships in 00 fleet combatthis leaves alliances with choices on what bcc fleets to fly the most common fleets can either be summed up as1 drake fleet with vulturetengu bonuses and scimitar logistics2 after burning armor hac fleet with damnationloki bonuses and guardian logistics only one of the ships that fits either of these setups is avaliable to low sp pilots hence the drake has become the king of the 00 fleet fightif ccp mess with the drake they are messing with a symptom not the cause other options include nerf logistics nerf sig raduis bonuses buff damage of large turrets against smaller targets all of those options would involve a level of committment and foresight that ccp have shown time and time again they lack
while i agree that a paint show would be great there needs to be a way to keep it from getting out of hand using a system like the one i suggested involving microtransactions will do such a thing
the fact that youre accusing hersh of trolling makes you look like a child who cant accept that its been told its wrong if theres anyone on the forums that wont troll you its hersch yes you were two members off not a giant deal  until you make it into one by whinging on about the correction like a five year oldthere are also those of us who are tired of reading this proposal every couple of months by people who are absolutely convinced that their version of it is absolutely right like you i fall into this second category but i will also not troll you  despite my urge to open this post with an initial verbal slapif you want people to take you seriously stop being an idiot
have the colors only remain client side your raven will look pretty yellow or carebear pink to you but to everyone else it is just a normal raven
that at least is guaranteed not to add network lag it might add rendering lag but that would be you own fault at that point
if youve got money you dont need donate it to ccp instead of suggesting that new features cost a premium to everyonewhat kind of get out of hand are you talking about  too many poor people get shiny thingspaint job idea is nice not really a priority but customisable ships  win
waste of time thats your fault buddy i use eve gate all the time also it is getting better your statement is like me saying they should not fix blasters because i dont use them so what about when you do want to use eve gate oh let me guess then they can fix it your selfish buddyobviously supporting
id support this and i disagree with the space issues drake brought up for one reason ccp is already storing the data requiredthink about it a killboard needs to know the following informationthe characters involved the ships invovled the items dropped the isk values etc etc etcccp already stored all this information because they provide it to other kbs via the api so for ccp to proviude a kill board would not require any more real database space they even store the kill mails somehow so the queries to pull the data already exist in large partin reality all this would require is an official ui integration into eve gate which seems like low hanging fruit to me
it might actually give me a reason to use evegatethis might make it too easy to find everyones killsfind out who all is in a corp for a war dec
dont give a damn about evegate but a uniform source for kills would be appreciated even if it has not frontend visualisation but for sync only
ive often wanted an option to stay online but let people know that im afk or tell them what time they can expect me back i imagine it must have been brought up before perhaps some standard options such as you see on msn away afk busy or preferably something where you can leave a customized message like back at 1600 eve time prompted by them starting a conversation with you or sending you a mailmaybe im just speaking for myself in which case ill just keep on walking but i would find it very useful
well i dont think it is necessary but if something like that will be in game i will use it
not hard to find panyway i want the same 
ah epic i dont really pay much attention to the csm topics etc if im honest but i am glad to see its on the agenda d
there are plenty of other containers that can be put in freighters and smaller simply put this would be a waste of development time
why do you need to move them you can buy them in every npc station in the game afaik so at what point would you need to move them somewhere
to about any player build outpost in 00 as you cant get them there 
if memory serves there is a blueprint buy it and use it its cheap
i find it increasingly frustrating that the majority of the best corp names and tickers are taken by alts dating back 7 years in some cases a lot of those accounts are no doubt inactive owners have possibly or probably left the game with only 5 characters allowed in a corporation ticker it is near impossible to come up with something thats attractive and original i have two possible solutions one is to have a cap maybe 345 years where if no one is active within that corporation the name is reset to something like corporation00001 and so on the other possible solution would be to allow a 6th character to the corp ticker allowing for a whole new batch of words one other annoying thing to point out as well if a corporation is closed down the corporation name can be used again but not the ticker  does this have to bea similar topic could be started for character names but really you are far less limited than you are with corporations and in particular corporation tickers
i would support the idea of expanding the corp ticker a character or two
i hate the fact that as a csm you are pushing for changes to boosters have you asked any of the major people in the booster trade how drug sales are going and whats wronge with it have you been working in the booster trade since release day like i have have you moved a bil or 2 of boosters into jita for sales cause your corp just got bought out have you personally delivered drugs to a new client who wanted fast service to npc low sec or npc 00 system i personally have many problems with whats going on with boosters but i have been working with them for a long time you changes will take all the work out of them and make them nothing more than a piece of trit i do not support your idea i do not support your changes i do not support you being csmif you want to learn about the problems with the booster trade talk to anyone who has been doing this long term and not for a month and cant figure it out themselves
imo you forgot the most important boost for drugs reduce the chance of having them confiscated by customsmany 00 dwellers are already regular drug users empire just needs a nudge
hey guys as many of you know theres just no end to the scams and faultyfraudulent contracts that can be found in game i purpose that it be make a petitional offense that if you scam blatantly on contracts that you can get fined by ccp and the items in question be returned to the rightful owner whether it be isk or otherwise ei mods plex etcthis is not for the whinny pansies that i see everyday in game or myself as i actually sort the really from the fraudulent contracts before buying but for ccps consumers which if they stop playing this game will cause ccp to stop producing updates tofor this game and the servers being shut downlet me make this clear im saying this is as bad as if not worse than isk selling for real cash and is actually more damaging in the long runso as stated ccp please take time to find a solution to this travesty that is characters like industrial mining
show us on the doll where the bad man touched youccps already nerfing contract scamming with the advent of faction ships n stuff being sold on the market
quitely disguising epic tears does not make them any less qqgood work industrial miningoh and i hear in wow you get your stuff back maybe eve is a little too hard for you the rest of us are fine
im sorry but no this is the sandbox learn from your mistakes and learn to read the fine print
no eve has something special the other games do not it punishes stupidity and carelessness scammed people and rewards intelligence and meticulous planing scammer how about returning to wow i hear that scamming is petitionable there
excuse me sirmadam but i am now the rightful owner of the 420000000 isk in question i have a contract here that you presonally signed clearly saying that you have received one unit of raven for it
i know but at least there must be some reason to train 30 refineries is too little for thatoh whell who cares
try training something youll actually use occasionally
aleeady done that its not just because my industry alt only those skills left to train its about a whole thingthere is hundreds of combat pinots skills that have a reason to lvl v how long they take its another question and a lot of industry skills doesnt have that reason that isnt look right
just make it that you need to go to the system to know who is the owner and the development levelssmall alliances will have a small chance to stablish themselves in 00 unnoticed
no  big alliances needs someone to pvp with
dont think this will solve your problem the information can be easily metad by spamming out scout alts and logging the information also it doesnt make much sense that you wouldnt know who claimed sov since the fees are paid to concordi think fixing the stupid as  sov mechanics are more important and have a much better chance to give new people an actual foothold
i know it will not be a definitive solution but could work againts lazy alliances that dont patrol their dominionsits fine for me if they actively scout their systems instead of using free intelin relation with the concord issue from a roleplaying point of view i like to think that what is paid for sovereignty is for bribes so
i have been thinking over the past few days about random stargates that act almost like a wormhole each region has a starportal that when used like a normal stargate will transport you to a random regionsystem anywhere in the nullsec eve universe i think it could be great for both solo and small roaming gangs while not having a great impact on anyone else while there would be a large increase in suicide roams thats also fun to defend against and yes random means random there is no way to know where you will end up solo ppl will go to different locations gangs will jump together when fcboss jumps them thoughts ideas
i dont understand why mining ships cannot fit ladar gas harvesters and dont even have bonuss to themmining in a bc just seems wrongany mining ship should have enough bonuss to outmine a battlecruiserships should have bonuss to what they were designed forotherwise the next thing you know  we will all be missioning in hulks doing the angel extraveganza
ore  gasas for what seems wrong  if it works its not wrong no matter what it seems like
most fleet dictors fit double bubble this usually means fitting a coprocessor and two sphere launchers i really dont see a need for launching more bubbles than that
they can already be destroyed by smartbombs so go ahead and fit one to your interdictor if its that much of an issue otherwise its a balances feature as it is and as other people say you should have to commit to dropping one
if i have to sit in coffin mode in my hictor you have to sulk in your little 2 minute hellbubble too
everyone uses double click to move and align to targets changing this would break fleet combat just set orbit to your cans and it will work fine if you dont believe me get on sisi and do it there
optional would be great sometimes when i am spamming ctrlclick for a lock i do not want to move closer to the ship
this i like the double click to move in some instance in others its a pita
to all the idiots saying no because it would ruin the game to not have the ability to do thisthe op said optional as in an option
supported of course spamming ctrlclick to target multiple enemies means you mend up moving towards them if your clicks are too close together in time no really ctrlclick this target then the next one too quickly and the game thinks you doubleclicked the second targetwhen this happens while i am flying a speed tanked sniper boat things get messy very quickly
yes so much pleasei was going to make a proposal about this but have the option of remapping the command so for example you could have shift  click or any other combination of a button plus clickalso with the revamped shortcuts coming its the perfect time to do thisas for why i would like the option of changing it from a double click my last two mouse have a very sensitive click which means sometimes when ive jumped into a 00 system which is bubbled my ship has started to move when ive rotated the camera to see which objects to align tocans to avoidarea to cloak to this usually ends in a frustrating deathand its all because of thisfor those of you who live by double click thats fine but lets keep it optional
yeah i really love the bug where double clicking in another d3d app is picked up by eve and makes your ship move this needs to be an option
cromo effect now  double dee
im wondering that myself her ideas are certainly stupid enough
so you lost some fights simple solution is to get more friends watch enemy movements plan out when to strike them and when to run i think you will find high sec war decs to be very fun and worth your time
nice attempt at a troll but too obvious
i always thought this should be changed myself
so instead of trying to discern between stabber and stabber fleet issue you would rather have to try and sort out republic fleet stabberrepublic fleet firetailrepublic fleet tempestrepublic fleet typhoonrepublic fleet scythecome back when you have thought this through all the wayediti wouldnt mind seeing it changed just for the sake of consistency but the if the op thinks this will help his overview issues hes smoking something
sigh another person not doing their research this idea has been brought up i dont know how many times just get the most recent thread and build on that no reason to keep spamming the same idea over and over
all this would do is make this new ship the standard for mining and make hulks and such obsolete your introducing one ship and eliminating the need for 36 others sorry but it is just unintuitive
the idea has merit maybe the subsystem has a drawback like rigs that lowers the ehp of the ship when fitted
just rename the hanger
the players should be the ones dictating law enforcement in 00 not npc characters
while this has some merit i dont think it should keep you from showing up on the directional scanner maybe from being scanned down

as fawka wrot above the original petition was closed timed out waiting to be escalated this is not an uncommon occurrence with issues that confuse junior gms that is the point i am trying to makeactually we killed what looked like a ratting bsi can also see a few members of the pandemic legion damage control team throwing a few less than useful remarks aroundzenthral staichon chooses to lawl at the whole thing wize but not postworthy perhapsexactly why a gm should investigate andor escalate when we ask for it he should not ignore the petition it is possible to work around the problem if four or five people removeadd someone they are very likely to get a proper result  welcome to 2003 see how that workshow eloquent dear fellow as pointed out earlier it might be a good idea if the some of the potentially biased representative yield the floor on this one since you are reluctant to do so allow me to point out that we agree we do need proof we need gms to take petitions seriouslyevidence can come from many sources and when determining validity ccp might elevate some of it to proof repeatedly screaming proof like a rabid chihuahua makes you look like a waste of votes imoback on the topic i still think we may need a petition process overhaul as we grew larger and a tiered sorting was implemented i am arguing that some of the more complex issues slip through for reasons that are not validinstead of placing the burden of proof on the witnesspetitioner i suggest we keep the right to deliver evidence with both the players and the gms but leave the proving it part to the investigators and their superiors
that is a bit of a generalisation some of the readers appear to grasp the issue you choose not to try to read my post above it may clear up some things as i have attempted to be more clear on the difference between evidence and proof and how it relates to petitions in generalif you are commenting on the example i provided about the person we shot then you are missing the point for that particular issue fawka not me is handling the petitions and any escalations his latest reply was that a petition timed out as pointed out he would need to keep refreshing it while waiting to hear from a senior gm he did not and that may have been a mistake i trust a new petition has been createdallowing active petitions to automatically time out is problematic once they contain a please escalate from the petitioner or a needs investigating from a gm the petition system should perhaps disable the time out function entirely now that is a tangible suggestioni can see you also invoked the goes to cry on forums part that is in no way useful since you yourself choose to make the point on a forum by assigning the modifier cry you reduce the signal to noise ratio of this forum and help make a case for reintroducing permanent forum bans kindly refrain from wasting 1s and 0s like that in the future
trust but verify sure someone who reports someone using a local hack could be lying however that provides you a name if a gm follows that name around on the assumption that gms can observe in secrecy which i figure is a pretty safe one then theyll either not see the behavior again or theyll see the hack in action themselves they dont need to trust the evidence submitted to them unequivocally but rather the need to trust it just enough to get some firsthand observations to verify it one way or the other moving into speculative territory it should be too terribly difficult to automate a system to periodically check up on people on the suspect list to see if theyre showing up in local macroratters can see people in local why cant ccps gm toolkit 
theres also an easy solution to people filing frivolous claims people found making them can be liable to various forms of gm sanction themselves
stop overreacting the game will still be fun even after microtransactions take a deep breath and chill
wow i admire a man of principle good luck 
fixed my post to make more sensethere is no mention of eve being less fun and from what was seen in iceland the opposite will be truedue to my stance on microtransactions as the character tamber i can not in good conscience purchase plex while the effort i put into the game returns a high emotional reward and i get to meet some cool people with the coming changes to the payment model and the way that i personally play this is nolonger enough for me nor do i wish to continue paying cash for the amount of work and effort that i put into the game and the communitywhile i am completely aware of the benefits and pitfalls of plex along with the logic for and arguments against microtransactions  ive made my descision based on how i currenly play the game and how i roleplay my charactersi will probably return because this is a inging great game with an awesome community but my playstyle and expectations will be different and ill be playing a different character with a alternate end goal  all tailored to this new payment model tamber
i will probably return because this is a inging great game with an awesome community but my playstyle and expectations will be different and ill be playing a different character with a alternate end goal  all tailored to this new payment model tamberawesome dude thats what i mean just take the game the way it is or will be and let it roll you have done enough free work support and promotion for ccps game i learned years ago never to lift a finger for a game company again unless im getting paid for itgrats you won eve seriously
your trolls are the reason why you are irrelevant to me the moment i see you are willing to discuss maturely with me anything you want i would be happy to engage you in constructive discussion till thenalso i love how people allow themselves to insult others while being hidden behind their avatars and modems if you are able to come i would love to meet you on the fanfest next year
holy crap real life threat from care bear queen to guy who types green i officially claim this thread is now awsome
eve is a video game the core concept is to have fun most people who try this game have no fun and quit ccp wants a heck of a lot more people to play eve so they are going to have to unclench the sphincters lighten up in a big way and make the game one hell of alot more fun they know they have a winner with the multipayer after they solve blob warfaremassive unmovable alliances and lag but oh man the pve and timesinks are just so tedious and awfulremaps faster skill training etc etc etc who knows whats comingare going to happen its only a matter of time and the player base will rise because of itccp wants money more than anything if they were so worried about the integrity of the game they never would of introduced gtc for plex i bet they make more money from that than subscriptionsyes im drinking
do you think its possible to include this in decembers meeting
still need fix
hell noall new features should be part of the game not bought with plex or real life dollars new features should enrich the game not enrich ccp while killing immersion
no

nobut id actually would like to see cosmetic only implemented microtransaction so ccp can take idiots money ability to blow up said cosmetics would be nice too but real  potential is in selling skill points remap lol theyre testing us unique modulesships etc it would be too tempting for ccp slippery rope yes definitelybtw props to you tamber for commiting to this

noits a slippery slope i was almost willing to go with cosmetic but someone here posted about team fortress 2 a game i loved in the past now selling hats that make you imune to headshots how the hell does that benifit the gaming community its like seling a module that makes you immune to neuts active pvp tengus anyoneive had 2 accounts now both active for over 2 years thats over 750 ive paid to play this game seriosly if the 4oddmillion per month isnt enough charge me an extra 1 youll get more outa me that way than with micro transactons1 extra a month wont make me quit eve 5 once for anything will

i totally agree that the frigsdessies t1 or t2 with insufficient mids do struggle in general purpose fights in the best case scenarios they wind up only being choiceworthy in very niche circumstances this could do with some workas for cruisers i am not really convinced they are as bad as you make them out to be i flew ishkurs for a long time everything from the std fit to total bizarroland fits and overall it performed exactly where a balanced af should granted the ishkur is one of the top afs with the jag and wolf and not all afs will be able to do the same the most pressing problem that cruisers present to afs imo is that so many cruisers are fitting specifically to counter afs and faction friggies now i cant come up with a good argument for why a ship that diesgets chased off when the other ship is specifically setup to kill it needs a boost it seems to me that asking to boost the ship to the point where it doesnt get killedchased off by competent pilots is really asking for someing op by definition if you have a good argument then by all means share thoughps you get no sympathy on the tracking thing if your talking about jags and wolfs they always track as good if not better than my blasters
i know that some assault frigs tend to have issues the vengeance has the potential to be an awesome little assault frig and im in love with the idea of that ship not to mention its looks but the low dps factor does tend to be a buzz kill theres an amaar armor tanking missile boat hac which is an awesome combination if we could just fix rockets a little or raise the bonus for the vengeance it would help as for a 4th bonus yes that makes sense since most other tech 2 ships have that

did you play eve gallente drone ships have more tank than gallente blaster ships because drone ships do not spend low slots for damage modstry to play more than free 14 days
oh right i forgot about the huge tank thats possible on the rax 1600 plate  3x trimarks 4tw right oh wait but now you cant fit the medium guns you get bonuses to thats ok cuz you fit small blasters amirite i think this sufficiently sums up your working knowledge
iirc blasters use the same amount of capsec as lasers because laser boats get that 10lvl bonusalso lol troll fights hjlaskdjfa and neener

of course lolsnature of the beast 
my opinion of coursenew eden and real life should be as far separated as possiblei know we need to pay subscriptions and plex makes that a more fluid process but any other connections to the real world and the real dollar need to be avoided at all costsi vote no and not just because the principle doesnt sit well with me ive seen many forms of microtransactions come and go throughout the years in my other mmos and most of the time it hurt or outright killed the game given enough time
i dont see anything wrong with it its not like their gonna let you remap sp for plex not supported

please do not discuss existence moderation
danger epeen in danger this topic is full of retards
supportedplex for remap is a very very very very very very very very bad idea
whats all the panic aboutwe can allready buy plexes and sell them ingame for iskthat allready gives a bigger advantage than a neural remap which can be done for free once a year anyways
you are absolutely right ima change my vote down these s are acting like its some sort of sp remap
proposali propose that concord takes a holiday for 24hours once a year every yearprosthis is an awesome ideacons24hours is so little time
thunderdome
strangely compelling
could be fun with a supply of frigates at hand
space dunkin donuts run o
wtfits no concord in lolsecor someone thinks that carebears and haulers will undock this day
concord on strike people would actually ask for more
h3ll yeah
and then too once a year every year too during absence in high sec eventually they move to low sec  so new  low skill player would not be 100 ed
make it 23 hours even concord need to rest at downtime 
this has been asked for before and the same answer will make it through today  no if you want to experience life without concord leave highsecurity space and quit trying to force your game style on others because you think it would be comicaltldr no
my guess is ccp would not want to go to the programming effort to reduce pvp combat if all the pvp ships are in high sec looking for pve ships then combat in their former haunts will go down while the minuscule number of pve pilots who would undock on that day would not make up for it it would be quite annoying if that was the day when your spouseparentsboss was out of town and it was your rare opportunity for some significant eve time but if you have a flexible eve schedule it would have zero impact on you and it would be an interesting experiment ps there are already two scheduled every year do you expect much concord activity for the day after the new expansion hits especially the next one with the new graphicscharacter engine
this post is serious
very well worded better than i could have said it
1 internetsedit i quoted the wrong person
thered be more people than there is in lowsec currently thats for sure
thisonly noobs would undock this day you really want noobs tears this much 
you must be new to this game
to be honest im tired of the local debate 1 on your idea but im gonna spell it out for everyone elselocals primary use is an intel tool to find eeryone in system even cloaked playersremoving local helps pirates just as much as carebears its not one sided if pirates cant see the carebears the carebears cant see the piratesmacros cant insta see nuetrals and hide in pos if there is no local to see nuetralsyes it will lead to mass spam of the dscan buts its not like nobody uses it nowsov warfare stuff not being able to instatly know what thier enemy force size is is a good thingtheres a few others but ill leave it at thatedit checked the box
just as insane as removing carebares from the local channel but forcing any player who have podded anyone in the past 6 months to remain in localeither make local an obtainable channel in nulsec or not at all
it is easy to write this topic off as a dead horse but i truly believe that this compromise would be well received by the majority of evewhy do this  the logic behind taking local from unclaimed systems simply makes sense carebears cant complain because they dont deserve to grind isk in such a system if they are to cheep to pay the cheep bill and thus retain local this feature will be a small but unbelievably refreshing improvement to 00 small gang warfare it will bring back the excitement and uncertainty when traversing 00 spacedoing this for the wrong reason pushing the issue in hopes of ending 00 macro ratters will never be accepted by ccp simply because it is only going to affect a small amount of violators compared to the thousands of macro miners in empire and thus not worth ccps timelook at this idea with the mindset that its sole purpose is to rejuvenate and intensify the average pvppve pilots experience because no matter who you are we are all carebears in one form or another  hiero
agreed
hey thats my idea  i just cba to start a thread about it as others had already mentioned such a way of handling local in 00well this gets my vote whatsoever
a reasonable compromise i suppose
if the sphere still works ccp needs to remove local entirely and sooner rather than later
tired of the debatestill 1 for a decent compromise
tbh i like the idea even though iUFFFDd just say to extend it for claimed systems that sovholders can decide who can use local and who canUFFFDtwell itUFFFDs not like they are too cheap itUFFFDs more like someone putting up a tcu atracting the powerful neighbours that kill it just 4 funi consider macro mining inefficient while rattingbots can be seen in every second system in some regions of 00 space some russian alliance i am not going to call by itUFFFDs name is actually providing active support for the bot users amongst their rentersdisabling local for nonsov holders or disabling it in unclaimed space at all would surely  off those bot s

it used to be difficult to move large numbers through multiple regions so as to hold spaceattack spacenow days anyone set blue to a coalition can jumpbridge over half of eve in a few jumps this allows for massive numbers to stagnate 00 being able to control pretty much whatever they likei think if eve wants to remain a sandbox game where individual players can still have significant impact on the outcome of the game then these massive numbers need to find it harder to move to wherever they want whenever they want on the drop of a hatoptions1 make it so that only alliances owning jumpbridges can pass through them2 limit the amount of fuel the bridge can carry severely perhaps enough so that only one freighter or cap can pass through it and say 10 bs or something like that the best way in my eyes to do this isnt to just limit the amount of fuel you can put into the jb but also make it so that more fuel is needed to jump things through so that it requires serious logistics to gather fuel at poses if people want it to be so easy to move giant gangs through jbs3 remove them from the game
even ccp devs dislike that you can travel so quickly
this ive seen my share of people jump bridging to get away from a roaming gang only to be gathered with 50 or so of their blues 10 systems later
heres my personal suggestiononly one jump bridge can be anchored per constellation so moving through a whole region would require about half of the jumps to be made through normal gates
in the old days these ships were underused thus didnt cause any problem for this game now days it is common to see 2030 logistic ships in the same gang lots of the time you end up with 2 gangs both having upwards of 20 logistics shipsthis has made pvp extremely boring and relatively unrisky compared to what it used to be i imagine missions alsoi propose one of a few things1 logistics can no longer rep one another only other nonlogistic class ships 2 introduction of a new t2 bs logistics make it relatively expencive but able to fit large reps then draw back the bonuses to powergrid for the logistics ships  medium reps still give plenty of reps though so this needs more thought you can even leave logi t3s as they are considering their price3 remove them from the game
mr miniginwe the other players of eve would like to thank you for taking the time to formulate your ideas into a post and present them to usregrettably we are unable to accept your idea at the present time because frankly we enjoy not getting blown up constantlyhowever i can assure you that should our position on that change we will gladly reconsider your proposalyours in fellowship
sorry but this proposal is bad
in fairness most fights these days are a simple who has more logistics equation its not the endgame of pvp but it plays a huge role in pvp i think the problem stems more from bombers and the lack of a possible long range platform for bs and the drake issue more than anything else though if ccp were to fix probing fix drakes and fix the ability of bombers to easily  long range setups more easily than cr setups i think the logistics issue would go awayi still think light dictors bubbles need to be looked at as well heavy dictors have an actual defined limitation to their bubble if the heavy interdictor dies or gets neuted or gets out ranged its bubble becomes useless light dictors die and their bubble still projects itself for up to 2 minutes this makes no sense as it affects warp ins and the ability of fleets to escape
or people could stop fit lr fleet bs in glass cannon mode most cr fleet bs survive because they actually fit some bufferand since your drake comment i am quite sure you are just trolling and dont understand i think it is rather balanced they die faster but their bubble can last a bit after they died hics are harder to kill but their bubble is gone instantly
more strategies not more nerfs
nofor one making use of logistics requires skill and organization yeah it keeps people alive thats sorta the point but it has a significant cost and can go horribly wrongfor another logistics lessening the value of dps heightens the value of alpha balancing it with the much vaunted dps and allowing for a broader range of strategies where before there was no real question weather you preferred to have 40 apocs or 40 tempests the alpha of the latter enabling it to eliminate portions of the logistics chain in a volley promote a broader mix of strategies to counter logistics

agree
agreed
seriously just make another one during the year some time definatly worth it everyone enjoys them etc etc maybe make one as a corporation tournament that could be pretty bad ass dont even need to do the whole iceland weekend thing just do it online polzplzpzlzpklsoklspokpzlzplzplzpzlz
we discusses this with ccp unofficial and the issue is that organizing a tournament proper one is extremely costly esp in manpower i am sure everyone would like to see more tournaments but at then its all up to the point of finding a good balance of quality vs quantity
kind bump
this reply is brought to you by a relatively bad piloti am an amarr toon cross trained in caldari i have a decent distribution in skills totaling a fair amount of sp i recently fit out a drake to much satisfaction yes the solid tank and the solid dps is nice but it does still use missiles so when it gets right down to it a different bc would be a better choice imo in a fleet than a drake yet it still has its use and could still serve as a benefit the drake is such a popular ship for this reason it is easily in reach for newer pilots and can be put to use in many different situations in eve does this make it op maybe it could be that a jack of all trades of this type was not intended i for one do not believe this and after taking the ferox for a spin i think ccp felt bad for caldari thats just my two cents and i will not be supporting this support or the similar one just below it the drake is fine the way it is takes a lot of skill to completely max out as it should but also can be fit decently at a lower spin short leave my drake alone or make the ferox less of a failboat
choose between tank and utilitythe drake can fit a lse and 2x invuln and still fit a disruptor and webwhat other ship can fit a point web 3x damage mods and still have more than 80k ehp
you do realize that a cane can fit 2 damage mods tackle dual nuet tank and cap booster or dual web and still not have a pg implant rightedit and have really good dps and also the drake is one of only good pvp caldari ships

eve used to be a game where different ship classes served different roles within fleets ceptors acted as tackle cruiser classes acted as support killers battle ships acted as the bulk firepowerbut as eve has progressed diversity has left fleets the old swarms of frigates have been replaced by much smaller swarms of hics and dictors and fleets have become single entity compilations rather than diverse there used to be a balance to roles that is no longer filled now we see fleets comprising of only hacs and logistics or only battle cruisers and logistics or only battleships and logistics and even the dictors are slowly being phased out because its easy to sit at 0 and hold points on primary targets id like to see eve return to a game where generic 1 ship type fleets are replaced with more balanced needs in fleets again we have 6 or 7 tiers of ships in game atm and the game is hardly finding a use for a mixture of tiers any more less not classes within those teirsbefore the rabble rabble starts saying that a few arazus or a few rapiers in a fleet makes it diverse is in no way an acceptable counter argument to what eve was in the past in terms of mixed platform combatexamples of lack of balance between tiers are the ability to fit a 1600 plate on a cruiser class ship and boost its ehp by 34x what its base is the equal range issue of cr bs vs armor hacs with the exception of the apoc omni platform drake fleet thats good at killing everything the inability for frigates to have any significant impact on fights at all the huge disparity between destroyers and bc filling roles the abilities of carriers to field both fighters and unending waves of smaller drones while also remote repairing etc the fact that signitures on ships make no sense the fact that slot layouts on ships make no sense the fact that drones are overreachingly spread across 4 races when they werent meant to be
am i aggreeing with northern coalition edit spelling my typing is off today
i just want to be able to click the corp tab and select afk some of us including myself have a tendency to walk away from the computer for a long period of time or even go to work with the client still logged in its more of the hard core eve players that do it a lot of times we just want to keep tabs on things when around the house some of us just like to stay logged intheres reasons that may or not be obvious for a feature like this to not be usable in local chat but it would be useful in corp chatit would be nice to be able to turn the flag on and off by right clicking the tab but a corp member came up with the idea of either a logo coming up or your name turning yellow after 30 minutes in the chat list also when you typed again it would automatically clear or your could manually turn it off again resetting the timeras of now the only thing we can do is add afk to our bios but that is to cumbersomei just came into this problem again today where i stay logged in at work and confused the crap out of a few people in my corp i was going to start a new thread but posted here insteadhopefully ccp is listening and has an idea for thisi do however like the fact that there is no auto logout and dont want that to change
not all stations have manufacturing slots
allow individual players to have hangar divisions this will solve almost all of the problems that station containers are used to solvejust let us organization freaks organize already
the solution here is to ensure all stations have at least one manufacturing slot even if its heavily gimped speedwise or restricted to only build station warehouses
one of the number one reasons long range bs platforms do not work in this game anymore is the threat of bombers ccp explicity implemented bombers as a means of deblobing people yet the game tools still lack any appropriate way to deblob a fleet without some very elementary mechanicsits time for ccp to implement fleet formation warping to enable fcs the ability to warp fleets in a more scattered pattern to help prevent the use of bombers and dictor bubbles on a 0 meter landing its absolutely obsured that its been talked about for over 4 years and not been implementedgive us the ability to fleet warp in patterns that act defensively to enable better warp in and on grid warping tacticstypes of formation possibilitiesthe scattered ball fleet warps in at random ranges of 030 or 050 from a center point in a ball shaped patternthe line draw fleet warps in on a singular path at 030 or 050 from a centerpoint wing dictation each wing commander sets his pattern based on fleet options and the fc sets warp in ranges for each centerpoint of the wing commanders ie for 3 wings each wing sets their pattern and the fc chooses a warp in range for each from 0100focused warp same as todays mechanic where the fleet lands within a tight sphere on a singular pointv formation ducks do it so why cant we v formation keeps the fleet on the same plane based on warp in angle but delivers them in a v shaped patterntackle formation similar to the wing dictation but without actually setting wings up individually the fleet gets warped in a set ranges based on ship class ie cruisersfrigatesbc etc
or you could just sort your fleet into approapriate wingssquads by shiptype and delegate to them howwhere to warp on grid but this would of course require far more skill than most 00 fleet peons are capable of why engage a bit of grey matter when theres a chance you can get the game to do it for you
unfortunately i have to agree with lark divide your fleet up and have them warp in based on a fixed position like a cloaked ship or two
and if you had a clue how warping mechanics work atm youd realize that even if you warped from 050 90 of the ships would still be vulnerable to bombs and blobbed very close together the point is to deblob fleets not to use some  mechanic work around to try and implement what ccp has failed to do thus farsupportedyou warp a fleet in at 0100 4 out of the 7 options are 030 bombers can bomb everything within that range you lose 55 of your fleet you warp in at 0 50 and 100 now at any given point 13 of your fleet is vulnerable to bombs and bubbles and everything else at each of those pointsfleet formation prevents single point warp ins and focused effects it actually scatters the fleet with out wonky warp ins and if dictor bubbles are on grid a bubble fleet warp in would only affect a small group of your fleet not the entire fleet bc it warped in on that linei didnt say there werent work arounds in fact i explicitly said there were but that theyre terrible and juvenile for a complex game like eve formation warping adds effect and tactic to the game that currently isnt there
tbhthe sniperbs platform still worksafter that point the ops post just started to run together like spilt milk and emo tearsso no agreeing with whats already been posted in disapproval
the dollar bill and the 100 dollar bill are green yall dont worry about the differencesthats how educated your comments or larks comments were
you know fleets of the size youre talking about should be able to provide more than one cov ops alt for warp ins or assuming you dont have a wing of bombers decloak on you immeadiately you can then delegate squadswings to scatter in different directions to break up your battle ballall it requires is a little bit of lateral thinking
yes guys lets get a hammer and a screw driver and a cork and puncture the keg rather than just buy a tapyoure making the very argument i made for why we should have them its a pathetic system atm that could use some serious improvement why youre against improving a terrible system atm is beyond my comprehension
while larks response is good in theory it falls down practically1 combat tends to be fairly fast paced where a few seconds can make the difference between tackling the enemy fleet and watching it warp out the additional time needed for multiple warpins can kill a critical move2 fleet organisation still ing sucks in larger fleets once a wing hits full capacity a wing commander has no control to move people around into appropriate positions or even into different wings the fleet window frequently doesnt update properly or shows you as in the wrong wing of course theres still no way to tell if your squad leaderwc is even in the same system as you and most importantly there is no way to control which wing new fleet members join this can result in the wrong ships being under the wrong wing commander therefore preventing the right people from recieving the warpins and bonuses they should haveany warp system based on fleet ranking needs these issues resolved first3 cloaked friendly covops have no mechanic to know where they are relative to each other on grid at any given time this is a massive margin for error where pilots assume they are x distance but turn out to be y distance apart or worse yet various on grid effects such as pos shields and bubbles can result in wildly different results when warping to 2 different points and this can change with only seconds notice4 capitals even a moderate capital fleet needs many many warpins to eliminate crazy delayed collision effects this is compounded by last years siegetriage changes that ensure once a cap starts rolling it wont stop for a long long timesupported because the current mechanics are entirely inadequate however there should be some pratical ways toa still keep bombers relevant perhaps by limiting the size of subcapital formationsb create custom flying dong formations everyone wants to be in a giant dong
no im against dumbing down the game and catering to the lowest common denominator which is exactly what this is formations were hinted at years ago as were many other things pulling off a good bombing run is pretty hard to do especially with some of the numbers youre pulling out of thin air having seen assorted bomber wings in action there is a huge skill gap between different groups and its all down to individual skill from the pilots themselves scouts and fc if you want to have maximum effect and not lose 50 of your bombers on each run if you want to avoid getting bombed by someone who is engaging their brain enough to be able to pull it off then engage your brain and work for it instead of just pushing buttan and having your fleet land on grid in extended linein other posts you complain about rebalancing shiptypes so fleets are more diverse they can be diverse you just have to get a grip of your pilots and recruit guys who are capable of thinking for themselves instead of aligning warping locking and facerolling f1f8 current fleet setups only came about because its easier to coordinate 50 100 200 of one type of vessel under one fc again settling to the lowest common denominatoredit ill admit that fleets need a lot of work but formations are low on my personal priority list
the tracking bonus from such formations would obliterate hac gangs as well once again allowing battleship gangs to rule the universe
took me awhile to get my corp tickergallente trade uniongtu was takeni tried a few others ended up with gltu wasnt that bad but the corp with the ticker gtu has been dead for atleast 3 years1 on the corp name and 2 on the ticker
yes
the dead and inactive dont need corp tickers
actually im all for freeing up old tickers used by closed corporationsand ccp stated they wanted people to login when mentioning upkeep costs for stores in incarna so why not for corporations and tickers 
if no one in a corporation is active for a year or two i dont see any reason why not take their name and ticker yes they might miraculously come back at some point but active paying customers should be a priority afterall if even one of them had stayed active they would have been in no risk of losing either the name or the tickerwith character names i feel the time before a name reset should be much longer if it even should be possible character names are much more important since they are tied to an individual character history and identity basicly names that havent been used since eve started should only now start to become available again i wonder should ccp announce when new names have become available and give a list of those names or just clear the names at random times and not notify in any way not notifying in any way might be best so camping and ransoming names doesnt become a miniprofession
i think the corporations should be reset after a given time i had an alt who had a corp for a while then decided to shut it down a player who had not logged in for 6 months suddenly became the sole member of a corp whose name i later wanted to recreatefor character name clearing i could see that characters and their accounts that have both been inactive for 6 or more months and that have less than 2 million sp should also be deleted freeing the way for people to claim the name of trial characters that decided against subscribing and suchall in all supported
in the old days there were no minigin posts and the suggestion forums were a happy place full of laughing children who danced and laughed and played with gumdrop smiles all year long now it is a wasteland of terrible green text and poorly thoughtout ideasthis has made the forums boring and unpleasanti propose one of a few things1 an instant ban for use of limegreen tags2 a support group to help prevent terrible posting as a user of goonfleet dot com i know a thing or two about horrible posters and would be happy to share this wisdom to improve the community at large3 just remove him from the game
nerf tau ceti goonswarm federationim sensing hostility because nc cant nap we form voltron
who needs voltron when we form
in the old days goonswarm wasnt around and i mean i distinctly remember a lack of laughing children until you guys got on the scene so like lets not play a blame game or anything
my name is daitengu and i support this messageminigin goonswarm has been around in one iteration or another since the game came out
i guess you guys just tri tri and tri again thenhmmmmmmm s
i did not even know you could post green text it seems yet again those of poor posting backrounds are trying to ruin the since of balance of the eve online community forums that goonswarm brings it would be nice to at least have some sort of rep system so as to at least allow good posters to choose between the bad threads and good threads before diving into them at least this way we can save the minds of our quality eve online posters
ok bart how did the mass testing go can you fit all of the nc into one system yet
no but we can make a giant circlejerk in minecraft now and become relevant like voltron 
im kind of surprised you still think i ever wanted to be relevant in your eyes or for that matter anyone hereit is too easy to comment on the irony of this relevance statement so often used against me and alliances i am in in a thread titled nerf minigin in which you have posted twice already  and linked a photo where you appear somewhat obsessed by making a scene out of well me blushes im shy around crowds and such but i guess it wasnt obvious enough to deter you from doing soi guess ill go back to my irrelevant alliance and be my regular irrelevant self and in such a case as this is true i would still be content

ive got many issues with the watchlist1 you can only remove 1 entry from the watchlist at a time 2 sometimes the watchlist stops to function which means in order to repopulate it you have to rejoin fleet watchlist cannot be refreshed 3 the watchlist looks like something which wasnt created together with the current ui it feels like some kind of stopgap solution to usability problems in the the overview in other words it feels like the lp store as in totally underdeveloped 4 10 people only
1 hold ctrl or shift to select multiple entries and right click on one of them to remove all at once2 clicking the contacts tab does refresh the list to some extent it will certainly add any new contacts that have come online however there seems to be some issue with clients missing the offline notice for some contacts and having them remain online until you restart the client id bug report it but its been around forever and is hard to reproduce at will4 what i have hundreds in mine
hes obviously talking about the fleet watchlist for which none of your comments are trueyet another thing with the same name as other features confusing everyone cosmos anyone plex
supportedespecially because of
more than 10 people would be great
the capabilites of the alliance to manage itself through ingame tools is far too primitive and restrictive directors which are under the control of corporations and not necessarily alliance leadership have way to much power not the mention the capabilities of an executor are has useful as they should bealong with the obvious in bring alliance tools uptodate with at least corporation tools and providing the ability to have actual alliance own and managed assets ie allinace wallets and hangarsit would be nice if an alliance type government can be setup the basic ways im seeing right now are to allow a republic dictatorship or federation or a constitutional mixture of the threethe republic would allow for each corporation to appointelect 12 or more as directed by the constitution who vote on giving out roles allocating money changeapplying taxes declaring wars etc a republic implies that all stations and certain pos such as jb poss are under the name of the alliance and not the corp and are managed by those with the proper alliance roles also wallets and taxes would go to an alliance entity not managed held by any one corporation this is possibly the least effective from an executive point of view but means that a single person with cannot destroy an alliance in minutes unless of course it was voted to give himher that power accepting and kicking corporations would be handled by either a vote or alliance rolesa dictatorship puts all that above mention powers in the full control of the executor leadership all assets wallets taxes go to the executor corporation and all alliance rolesstationsposs are managed by the executor ceodirectors this is possibly the most effecient alliance government as everything can be managed by a single persons and no votes are required it also means that the executor has unlimited powers to exercise accepting and kicking corporations would be handled by the executor ceodirectorsa federation would mean that everything is put into the powers of the corporations there are no alliance assets wallets stationspos etc the only thing that defines the corporations is the fact they share the same alliance flag this is similar to how the alliance system is now everything is built on trust between the corporations if it happens that all the jbsstationscyno jammers were own by the same corporation and that corporation leaves well we saw what happened with bob and goonswarm accepting and kicking corporations would be handled by a vote of the corporations
anyone with multiple characters knows the pain of sharing items and information across multiple characters you have to go through a contract system designed with many options with fees and various scamlimiting measures want to send a ship to an alt well enjoy clicking through a dozen confirmation windows before being told the crystals are damaged and you cant do it anywayso why not define your alts ingame just define your main character to create you group it can then invite your alts to join characters can only join one alt group and the only way to leave it is to transfer the character joining the group allows access to assets on all other characters now you want to send that ship over just right click it and deliver to the appropriate character the system could also potentially be used to share evemails  so if you dont have a beefy pc you can still keep watch for important messages from one client instead of several what about bookmark collections right click them with a sensible limit and copy them to an alt characteraccounts that expire continue to be a part of the group but cannot use any of the integration features so you cant benefit from keeping an account unsubbed they regain full use once subscribed again
xttz for csm
this is a good idea and dont get me wrong you are an idiot but i can see this being a good addition some day however dont you think csms and ccp can use their time better looking at real problems with the gamei mean ignore the fact that you are perfectly fine with this game becoming more and more boring and tedious even for yourself so long as you continue winning under some bizzare definition there are things which more time should be devoted to than this
the current ingame mechanic to address this issue is called player corporation it works remarkably well though you are limited to exchanging goods through the corporate hangar in stations
this mechanic is based on needing specific roles so yes there is an ingame mechanic for this just 90 of players cant use it
not so neccesary featurecontracts trade give money is a quick actionswell anyway why so complicated group chars  and here it is ane char can use the assets of all another its all on station and in standard assets window nothing tells that its not belonging to current character well maybe some tiny icon on the item
just nobesides i dread to figure out what scammers could achieve with such a tool in their hands
i support this little bee
noso lets say mara and i want to be able to freely trade items between ourselves whats to stop me from letting her put me in her alt group now i can simply deliver to her and were shuttling things across accounts with no paperwork involvedthe only way i would support this is if it was only available to the other characters on the same account that would at least make the lives of some people easier and it would prevent my primary object of easily sharing goods across multiple players without going through the normal methods
i disagree with the initial proposal and most of the subsequent proposals as wellas a member of new edens oldest and most wellknown smuggling cartel i have to say the most pressing issue with boosters right now is not production not sideeffects and not customsplease please fix contracting issues with contraband it makes no sense that i can openly sell 100 units of strong blue pill on the market in jita but one single unit of standard blue pill cannot be contracted in a backwater 01 systemas for gameplay mechanics of boosters themselvesboosters having delayed sideeffects is not the way to go though i can see what you are trying to accomplish delaying side effects until after the booster is finished will lead to long periods of waiting out penalties while bouncing from safespot to safespot or docked in stationa better way to combine a penaltyfree period with boosters would be to have a short grace period upon injection the rushwhere the bonus is applied immediately but not the sideeffecteg standard exile injections might give 60 seconds of penaltyfree time upon injection and the remaining 2959 minutes of time will be subject to full penalties this gives users a distinct reason to hold off injecting until they are in combat yet allows more riskaverse pilots to inject early see what effects they get and then decide if they want to engage or notthis sort of mechanic also allows for the possible addition of skills to extend the initial rush period or tweaking rush periods by booster strengthadding more boosters needs to be carefully considered and evaluated with caution there are currently 16 booster regions producing 8 varieties of boosters in 4 strengths adding additional boosters will either require adding more booster regions and thus changing the balance of regional value or adding new blueprints and reactions to the existing regions thus diluting the supply of existing boosters to feed production of the new types neither of which is a particularly good solutionon a more socialoriented level i would like to note that the single biggest issue in getting more pilots to use boosters in my experience is not related in any way to any of the gameplay mechanics surrounding them it is simply that many pilots do not know they exist boosters are the dirty secret of eve no one talks about them few people know where to get them or who to contact and fewer people know how to interpret attributes tab and the sideeffects listing correctlybefore you go about making changes to booster mechanics you should look into changing peoples knowledge of boostersfrak
boosters needa boost
what boosters really need is cheap legal versions that can easily find their way into the hands of carebears in high sec think of it like this when a drug deal wants to get someone hooked they give them cheaply priced decent quality stuff
if you really want to develop drug addiction in eve introduce the attribute enhancers that already are in the database imagine how many people that would sell their own mothers to to keep going on 10 perception boosters that only last 8h each
the player base should police their owntake out contract 2 with a merc corp and get your epeen backccp is strapped for cash as it is to pay for more people to carebare contracts for the community
ill let you in on a huge secret there is a solution already ccp implemented it on day one of eve if you want to know what it is just send 250mil isk to me and i will mail you with the answer that has eluded so many people for years
welli just thinking what if a compression with rorqual will require lvl v skills1 its a capital ship so its not so long to train compared to other skills and again combat capital ships and not all of processings so needed for one person2 its will be very cool to have a perfect rorqual so leave lvl 4 to diggers and let one most competent miner do his work

goodluck  the way its going id be making sure my passport is in order  you got some holiday time tucked up your sleeve you could be on the next plane out
and why is that a reason to step down from the csmthe players trusted you to have a good impact on the csm and to get their voice through you to ccpalso  dont you think you could achive more and fight better against the worst of the microtransaction ideas when you still are csm member and not stepped downand what the heck have microtransactions to do with your wonderful events look at hats for eve for example why wouldnt be that any worse or less fun with microtransactions why would your wonderful soe events be worsei can see why you say that microtransactions and plex are bad but i dont get it why you would be that badly affectedanyway sorry to see you quitting best of luck in your future and thanks for all the wonderful events
im confused you dont want to pay to play and you dont want to play to pay
what the hell are microtransactions are they just litteraly what they sound like or is it something worse
good for you nice to see someone standby their principals i did the same when cohcov decided to do the same now look at the state they are in what i think a lot of people dont understand is rmt is a slippery slope today its the remap but what if tomorrow i can plex for sp or a titan i will personally watch this carefully and when it starts to get into that nickel  dime nonsense so many other mmos with subs  rmt try to do i will also walkthe biggest problem with the no mt argument i can already do these things in eve i can rmt a ton of plexs sell them and buy a character the equivalent of plex for sp imo or buy that titan its not spelled out to the player base but that system exists today and has for a long time i personally feel that the entire mmo genre will eventually be hurt as players will get tired of player advantages do to personal prosperity and burnt out on companies reaching into their pockets for every little pit of content its a greed that is not exclusive to mmos look at the growing dlc marketonce again i wish you well tamber and thank you for taking a stand its one i am not ready to take yet but respect your decision
microtransactions are the current fotm in game pricing 20subscriptionhtml a game company eliminating the 15month subscription fee and seeing a 500 increase in revenue got the attention of competitorsdust 514 was announced to be f2p free to play without a subscription income and ingame advertising not yet common  the revenue comes from selling virtual itemsbenefits troll this is more accessible than eves model of subscribe and train learning skills for two months  on a practical matter eve has been on the micro transaction side for quite a while you can buy characters with whatever skill points your budget allows plex to isk to purchasing whatever celestial steed i mean ship or module you need currently anyone running l1s or mining purely for the 100khour and not enjoyment are doing so because they value their time at less than a half cent per hour similarly as a new player your budget determines how much you mitigate the learning skills of eve stick with the 3 implants you got in your first hour or eventually have 5seconomist may think about the inflation and will the isk faucets and sinks balance out but it is hard to see even ccp getting the faucetsink wrong to the extend to have much impact on the size of the eve economyon an emotional level some really do not like the idea ccp proposing eliminating the middleman ie selling you skills directly instead of selling you plex that you convert into isk and use to buy a toon  raised the visibility of money for ingame advantage ccp was naive if they did not expect pushback many games that remain subscription based eg ww do not allow you to use real money to buy ingame advantage and even have limits on what advantages you can transfer ingame eve online has gotten past that quite a while ago which imho ymmv is a good thing perhaps because eves older customer base is more familiar with employment and moneyaddendum after writing the above it turns out champion online has gone f2p so funding games from microtransactions is a trend which is different than saying it is a good idea of course but over time it may change customers perceptions of microtransactions

the secret is not to sit back and watch carefully the secret is to get involved and make sure the csm is echoing your sentiment into ccps ears at every possible occasion ccp we already have as much mt as makes sense in this gameon the one hand we have lotro which significantly increased its shortterm income by going f2p with all content being bought after the player starts adventuring on the other hand we have dd online which fell on its face due to all content being bought after the player starts adventuringeve online already has microtransactions  you can buy anything in the game with real money buy plex trade for isk use isk to buy stuff you wantthe players need champions in the csm to keep the no neural remaps no sp for isk opinion in ccps faces players quitting the game over this issue only means that the antimt voice gets diluted
claiming the reason you wont deal with me is trolling while you deal daily with alliances such as goonswarm and test make me believe your issue isnt that im trying to troll you which i assure you i am not but with the fact that you dont want to answer the questions im askingthese are questions such as what do you think are the biggest problems with this game atm and what ideas do you have about ways of solving these problems and have you made an attempt to put these ideas forward during your many trips to icelandif of course you dont have answers to these then its fine you can continue pretending that the reason you wont talk to me is because im a troll if you have good answers to these you shouldnt have a problem talking to me or any other trollsbtw saying the reason your opinions have more weight than i do because you got to iceland irl yearly and i dont are pretty terrible reasons ill tell you the reasons i havnt gone thus far i just turned 21 this year i dont have 4000 dollars to spend flying from australia to iceland so that i can spend 3 days trying to get gms there to wake up and realise whats going on with this game when you should be doing that as your duty to this communityi guess being able to just order your countless minions to vote for you in an election they dont actually care about gets you that great sense of hummility where you just ignore the community you are meant to be working for
biggest reason a large 00 alliance has isk problems is either the leadership is spending it on their own supercaps account subs etc or even worse rmting tech moon profits
minigin for csm next year
lol youre pretty much spot on with this one hooyah six day shore leave
make an assembly post and suggest it
recommended revisionin light of the csm minutes and response from ccp i would like to add a revision to this to accommendate the newer players under the scc insurance envelope new players would be immune to scc suppression new players would be defined as players under the 16m skillpoint point already defined as the point in which new players stop getting their 100 skill bonus this is so it can not only provide a window of understanding but also be directly tied to the in game event marker in a capsuleers life also in the insurance tutorial an additional page will be added to the end to denote scc suppression and that its immunity ends at 16m skillpointsscc suppression would be defined as scc a division of concord would not pay players basic insurance when the insurance is due to be paid when the ship loss is due to that of concord police action this means that should you insure your ship you would get the difference between uninsured and insured amountsreasoning even experienced players can find themselves in an instance where attacking a target unauthorized by concord in high security space happens while this reasoning can lead to scc paying some insurance to those who still insist upon suicide ganking it would remove the profit being balanced out for such actions by insurance alone so in essence it accommodates the chances of eve with the legitimate but unauthorized by concord attacking of players in high security space and does not punish the act of buying insurance
1 not as easy as preventing yourself from being a stupid victim2 so if your bank gets robbed and u get shot do u expect the swat team to show up in 20 seconds when theyre miles away too and how did they get to the vault so easily since u didnt take enough precautions sounds like insurance fraud to me great comparison to real life from a science fiction game u got therein that case like ppl said void insurance entirelylow sec 00 high sec pirate low sec pirate everywhere everyone no real insurance company would exist to lose more money than they gain especially if they still have to pay out even if no insurance was purchased and since ure not partial to either side theres your sensible solution

to be honest youre right fix insurance or get rid of it
supported i am new player in eve  i was killed last night in jita in a coercer pod also with no fit and no cargohold i saw my killer was usual gank profile 10 security how the hell he can be in 09 system  i know now but at first i was very surprise then i began to study gank system to understand  and i was very surprise to see than there is absolutly no penality to gank people in hight sec they kill each other before concord to loot there ships they have ship assurance  i call that an exploit definitly lol in that case its useless to call that hight sec  better to put all systems like 00 lol i seriously want to stop playing eve not only for that loose 1 month work for my basics implants but because i can imagine later working hard to buy nice stuff to be destroy without reason in hight sec by a random gank its more than annoying  its only useless no thank you
seems to be alot of these troll stories appearing if this isnt a troll then you didnt get blown up by a normal suicide ganker but an idiot
no i was collateral killed by smartbomb
i support that insurance is canceled if you are killed by concord you are doing a criminal act and being reimbursed for it isnt that kinda weird it makes me think the insurance company is kinda evil promoting such acts and looking at it as a real company this person insures a ship for 10m the person knows its going to be blow up in a little bit and they go out and suicide gank someone the company pays the person 60m to replace their ship and do it again seems like a major loss in profit for the insurance company i think a real company would put in a claus like it the insured item is lost or destroyed in a crimanal act that is corrected by concord then the contract is canceled and insurence for the the item is not paid to owner
no
noalso there are still loads of people out there who have no idea this is going on and i talked to a few people yesterday who were all shocked and felt betrayed by ccpim even strongly against cosmetics because its one short step away too easy for them to one day just decide ok whatever also i want nipples and a giant  on my head for free
nomt are terrible
nosince cosmetic only seems to hold some sort of weird other meaning in devlandic i dont say it often but this would be the death of eve as it is and the death of eve as a worthwhile game for years of playing might stil be fun for stints of a couple months between other game releases iso the other way roundagain ccp you astound me by suggesting something so wrong on such a basic level
nonot another maple story online please
no
no
no
noeve should stay epic for ppl who love this game and not become a microtrans  like other mmos
nobeing able to remap is usefull true and mybe we make decision that we shouldnt of on planing our yearly remap and skills but thats the way eve is you have to think ahead and plan if you take away one of the core eliments where this phlosophy is ingrained you lessening the game as a wholeand as for micro transactions for clolors hats and clothes i say a big no if people want those items let us players build them
no with my 3 accounts
no i like the game the way it is
initially i thought about cosmetics only were doable but knowing how ccp works id prefer to leave that door closed sono
no thank you
couldnt care lessactually what i would like to see is a 8 lazor fraction battleship you can only buy with plex
no
noif subscription goes away cosmetic only
no
no
ive seen this thing microtransactions being discussed but have yet to see an explanation for what it is i must be searchig in the wrong places link explaining it please
no itll change the atmosphere of eve entirely and its a slippery slope

quit being stoopid this topic is about blasters not about boosting gallente top speed and the loadout i posted was showing that the deimos can do damage at 25k with blasters the same way a vaga can with ac and another fit i could post with the thorax could do more damage at 25k with blasters than a stabber with ac why dont you realize that im right about blasters and that the deimos speed and agility have nothing to do with this topic yes i said a deimos can do whatever a vaga can do but i didnt mean speedwise obviously i just meant what i proved that it can deal lots of damge at 25k with blasterslook im rightedit  also your vaga loadout sacrifices a lse for an invuln just so you can fit 425mm ac and try and get as much dps as my deimos loadout i also notice you fit a dc instead of a nano which anyone whos played this game before should that a a saltworthy vaga pilot would choose a nano over dc2 unless you really want the ehp which in this case you do to try and win the argumentedit  2  look im not saying that gallente are a perfect pvp race im just saying that if you really need to boost something it definatly is not blasters
no you said a deimos can do what a vaga does which is hit from falloff whilst kiting she said thats idiotic i personally would love to see this thorax fitalso saying stoopid that way certainly makes you look clever
i know i said a deimos can do what a vaga does and i know i meant hit from falloff whilst kiting and i know she said thats idiotic i also know shes idiotic because the fit i just posted can kite just fine all you have to do is show up and be a little faster than your target and with that much damage the fight will be over before he even has a chance of reaching you not to mention the bonus to mwd cap use the deimos and thorax get which enables them to run their mwds far longer than a vagaheres the thorax fit its got 440 dps 21k ehp goes 1400 ms and does 230 dps pat 25k thorax stabbaraxmagnetic field stabilizer iitracking enhancer iitracking enhancer iitracking enhancer iidamage control iiyt8 overcharged hydrocarbon i microwarpdrivewarp disruptor iilarge shield extender iiheavy ion blaster ii null mheavy ion blaster ii null mheavy ion blaster ii null mheavy ion blaster ii null mheavy ion blaster ii null mmedium antiem screen reinforcer imedium core defence field extender imedium core defence field extender ihammerhead ii x5an alternative is a nano instead of dcu but preferance
like i said gallente are fine because of drones no need to fix blasters unless you want to specifially to fly the enyo which is a good little ship regardless
no they arent because drones arent as flexible for damage selection as missiles as useful for large fleet battles and longrange engagements as lasers projectiles or lolhybrids and heavy dps variants are only useful in the same engagement envelope as autocannons or lolblasters and even then are likely to be quickly destroyed in order to negate incoming dpsin other words like the other two gallente weapons systems they are mediocre at best
outside of the box fixesincrease the damage bonus that a magnetic field stabilizer bestows theres no reason heat sinks gyros and mfs all have to be equal this plays to tank or gank tooreduce the fitting requirements for blasters a sawedoff shotgun is alot easier to carry then the ghostbusters plasma packremove the penalties for rigs dealing with active armor tankingincrease the chance of critical hits when using blasters noone jumped at this idea though soafter those i would look at tracking before adjusting ranges and such
just compared mega pulse to heavy neutraon and the neutron takes up 400 less pg and only uses up like 7 more cpu than mega pulses so yeah i guess a sawed off shotgun is easier to carry
alright it seems you people want to kee arguing even though you are so wrong its stupidto those of you wanting a blaster fix i pose this questionwould you rather fly a cerberus over a deimosishtaranswer that question
i would definitely fly a cerberus over a deimos and the ishtar is slightly irrelevant to this question as we are talking about hybrids and although ishtars can and do use hybrids they arent used as a primary weapon system
thats goofy man
is it the races in terms of powergrid for each ship class are ranked amarr  minmatar  gallente  caldarithat 400 pg is not as significant as it sounds and of course theres the whole 300 more range for 9 less dps thing going for pulse lasers
your strawman is bad and u should feel bad
for pvp if i had the skills i would rather fly the cerb over diemost and ishtarthe diemost is called that for a reason they die the most and are not that useful when alivesentry drones are not useable for sniper hac fleets reason you are active aligned out and thus you lose your drones when you warp or die because you chose not to active aligne out also heavies are to slow for close range hac fleets and lose them each time you warp out so after about 5 minutes of fighting you will be out of yor main damage dealing drones and the op just started in null sec you cant dock at hostile stations to replenish your drones you have to take it firstpve ishtar all the way for guristas though you arnt using hybrids just a civy auto cannon or something like that for aggropsgallente gun boat problems is two fold poor ship powergrid for example and a poor weapon systempssi dont think i ever seen a hostile eagleanother hybrid boateditwell prefering the cerb would be for sheild hac fleets if i cant chose one of the miniamarr hacs but for ahac i would go with the diemost only because it can mount a slightly better tank though compaired to the zealotmuninn it is epic failedit2i dont fly hacs but i flown with and fought against them for quite a while now and most hac fleets are zealots with a few muninnsvaga thrown in with a varying amount of logi ships guardianscimi depending on fleet type
vagabond do the same damage at 25 km with faction ammo but if vagabond load long range ammo too as deimos in your fit it will do more than x15 damagecomparing pure turret damage in dps graph it is about 200dps deimos vs 330dps vagabond90 web was nerfed nano was nerfed it was important condition for successful blaster usage  fast approaching and holding target after many changes blasters were not revised it is time to adjust blasters to new eve combat environment last projectile boost was awesome it is time to revise hybrid weaponps take a look on small gangs s in lowsec compare percentage of minmataramarrdrakesgallente

lmao at the pervert agreed but i would like to get a stippersex slave on my ship xd id be like chode from tripping the rift but not really
you have to remember that even tho you dont see it there is kids playing this game and there is parents that have kids playing this game so nudity is not an option even tho i would support the more realistic appearance lol
well their parents shouldnt let their kids play this game then
not talking about playing and the parent thing i ment like if a kid accidentally sees it also a few year ago ccp said they arent going to keep this a family type game so no nudity
it looks cool too
eh guy you are crazy to use again laser on the amarr ship its better to use now artillery omen artillery no problem capa and fitting and nice dpsharbinger artillery the sameand the best of the best is apocalypse artillery no problem with the tanking you have enough capa you make hudge alphanow they are only one weapons to use artillery for all you have only bonus with this weapons 
maller needs love too
would like a drone bay and a laser damage bonus on the maller that would be nice
omen base stats are fine but please for the love of god give it more fitting room50 more cpu and pwg would barely bring it in line with other t1 cruisersalso fix the harbs 7th turret
deffinetly supported
hes right the omen is ty right now when comparing it to stabber caracal vexor it just doesnt bring anything new to the table right now anything the omen can do the caracal does better except being a shield nano  but neither of them are meant for that anyway fix that omen
just needs more fitting room
omen has needed a boost for so long its unreal supported
this is quite ridiculous it is almost impossible to fly the omen without electronics 5 engineering 5 weapon upgrades 5 advanced weapon upgrades 4 and energy grid upgrades 4  nevermind fitting the essential t2 guns to this ship for access to scorch ammoexplain to me precisely how many pilots will still be seriously interested in flying the omen at the point where they have all those skills the only viable loadouts for this ship are nano setups because nano modules dont use fitting resources thats gotta stop

wtf ccp
i use that argument for actual attempts to force a play style not for a single day event using it here just makes it and you seem silly not wanting to possibly lose a single day of playing is fine but really pathetic that you cant see the possible fun in such a thing and are so averse to it
why not make a module for your ship that requires alot powergrid and cpu that makes you not show up in local unless you talk in it then to fix just warp out then jump out then jump back in and as a counter have a sov upgrade that can disable this
interesting ideahowever sbu spam will become more popular it would encourage people to spam sbus in random systems and more blob fleets will be assembled for taking down undefended sbus that are placed there for the sole purpose of removing local a form of griefing that means less true pvp more blobs more boring generic take down the sbu fleets and much less funit also might lead to overpopulating certain areas of space with limited sov infrastructure that is inhabited with mainly carebearsanother downside would be megaalliance disbanding for any reason including spies and disagreements in the leadership or losing the sov war catch region right now it would take some time to rebuild infrastructure there and removing local from unclaimed systems would not helpjust my thoughtso
hi yes hello
another couple of suggestions limit the number of activations per minhour cooldown timer  can allow small gangs or solo travelers to move quickly still if this was indeed intended and slows down with larger numbers make it similar to wormholes in that you need less mass to go through it or something so people need to offline mwdsplates or just have it so that they have to offline those things anyway  dont really like this one but just throwing it out there
jumbbridge spam is really getting ridiculous specially as anyone with standings can use them it should really be limited to alliance members owning jumpbridge just like cyno generators
break the jump bridges entirely cynos and jump drives can go too i miss good oldfashioned freighterrun logistics trips through 00 jump clones those also should go
not supportedi like jump bridges they are already ridiculous expensive with the new sov costs and often out of fuel without being able to refuel to most usersthere is no need to limit the freedom of using theminstead make the universe bigger we need more systems
more systems wouldnt help much if you can just curb stomp as easily as you can do atm because you can still cut down 5060jumps trips to 45 jump bridgesthats one of the reason why wormhole space isnt connected via gates or that you cant cyno jump to it to prevent the blob just to run over you and then jump home again taking a wh space setup requires a bit more effort and planning
with bigger i mean biggerso big that even you cant reach all places with a few jumpcheck the real universe this is really bigeve universe is pathetic small
that would lead me to the idea of lowering the cycle time of repers which would lead to more microing for the logi pilot as he now cant just turn his reps on he has to time the cycles and small ships could get alphaed a lot easier shifting logis more into the endgame battleship fleets
let me be clear on what the issue here is because people are being naieve in my eyes the issue is how cost effective logistics are and the spike in use of them if you are an fc as i was and you have a choice to order a bunch of people to join your gang in snipers or logistics the likelihood that you would ask them for logistics is growing eventually we will get to the stage where aif you are solo pvping  not that you would but assume you are you will almost certainly have to bust through logistics to kill anythingbif you are fighting a gang all it will ever come down to is how many logistics i have and wether they are asleep at the keyboard or notlet me reference this to nanoage play im sure many of you remember the outcry to nerf them because they were unkillable the reason this nerf was unjustified in my eyes was that there were easy counters to it and the actual piloting required and ounce of skill  decision makingthe weight of logistics ships pretty much get rid of any of this wether it be small gang or large further the counters are relatively outlandish and are difficult  almost impossible to pull off against a gang that isnt consisted entirely of people who have no idea whats going onnow i understand why people dont want this idea to go through because you all use logistics ships very heavily now well let me remind you before they were fotm we were running gangs with dual logis and up when we had the numbers and the results were undeniably awesome but in all my time flying with them i noticed something it was much easier than nanostuff far more cost efficeent the hardest thing in the entire setup was counting dps and counting tank then factoring in friggin ecm drones which also deserve a nerf  hi would you like to spend 20k to be invincible forever so dont get me wrong i get the reluctance to want this change but you are all going to have to make a choice now do you want this game to get easier do you want it to be all based on numbers do you not want to be able to make decisions in your fights that have more influence than just ill bring a logistics shipbecause we are heading there we are going to get to a stage where fights will get beyond boring and when we get there there will be no one to blame because the game is exactly what we wanted it to be ps i actually do kinda like the idea of lowering cycle time on the reps even if they buff the rep amount to compensate a little just because then it would actually require a bit more decision making but again its mostly with the force trying to crack logis which will usually be both groups but still i like that it would lead to more decision making
wtfsome words ewar neutralizers bombs alpha make sencet2 bs with triage module 
so tell me did you work out these perfect counters via your 11 kills and 9 losses
how does his ammount of losses and kills make his points less valid those are good counters and there are more tactics that can be employed very succesfully its not like logis are answer for all they can be countered even without altering fleet composition
his point isnt less valid it is just wrong and he would know this if he had experiance of itneuts and ewar are virtually useless against logi gangs for reasons so obvious i wont even bother statingsmartbombs are not effective at all because they require your adversary to be remarkably aweful i mean sure it works but you cant just rely on your opponents being bad and thus the counter is made  and perhaps most telling is that he ignored bombsbombers which have been used somewhat effectively in the past however again its so easy to not get bombedthe fact that logis have such small sig radius and usualy do well to keep their radial high means that alphaing them isnt nearly as simple as you are claimingyes it can work and i have employed the use of tps as well as alpha ships to crack logi gangs before but even with tps alpha ships and even ewar trying to harass it is still far far too easy for the weight of logis to hold their tanks for long enough that they dont lose many before they can retreat or whateverwhat this tells me is that most people want eve to move further down the easymode path i cant say this is good because i personaly want to see eve go back to being a dangerous risky game thats a lot of fun in my eyes this risk adverse more survival based game see rigshp buffetc is far less exciting and challenging than it used to bewas invisioned to be by ccp you arnt safe in eve but i guess i was the naieve one to believe that players wouldnt let ccp make this game more and more mainstreme and boring without so much as a whimperand you all think its microtransactions that will ruin eve what on earth are you trying to preserve now anywayim not used to being wrong 
the idea isnt as badas these people are saying
your fixes of the problem are too dramatic and cause more problems like the not letting logistic ships repair each other the opposing fleet would then target logistic ships first then pick off the resti think the problem you brought up is there just your solutions are bad here are my solutions i suggest solution 2 over solution 1my solution one add a very very small diminishing return for the number of ships reping a single ship not the number of modules pros the logistics would not be as strong and fights would go alittle faster and having a large ammount of logistic ships would begin to cause less and less effect on the battlecons the load on the server would increase causing more lag and logistic ship players and tons of pvp players will whine to ccpmy solution one result not suggested too much lag in pvp right nowmy solution two make it so that having a logistics module fitted to your ship would slightly reduce the amount of repairs you get this will cause less people to have their pvp ships and 1 logistic item for support of others but have the logistic specific ships almost negate this effectpros a great fall in the number of reps due to the fall in ships that have a single reper attached to their ship while not making logistics a huge targetcons slightly more lag but not much and again more whine also causes the ships that use a single reper to be less efficient at pvpmy solution two better than one but still needs work but i would say its doable also the problem gets fixed with little hit to normal gameplay
i like the stacking penalty idea glad you posted it i think it would maintain logis effectiveness particularly as a force multiplier esp in small gangs but will definatly curb those hour long fights where the only casualties are cosmetic
how about a weapon superchargera top slot module that swaps dps for alphawhen activated weapons do 4x damage but have a 5 times longer rofweapon must be activated before it starts building up power and fires at the end of the cycle to prevent its abuse in a precharged mode in suicide gank situationsbuild up cycle can be cancelled and weapons fire if the supercharger is clicked off
hmm like the idea but that would  the non buffered ships too much too much of a super weapon against smaller ship also look up the new doomsday set up your idea is already in effect only usable by titans tho
change cap transfer cycles to work like shield transfers instead of armor transfers cap deposited at start of cycle instead of end neuts will devestate cap transfer chains more easily leading people to increase use the somewhat less rep effective logi models done
its called artillery
im keen on a new type of ew that lowers the effectiveness of remote reps  cap transfer so it wont be as simple as ohh x is taking damage everyone rep himanyway ill support because since the alliance tourny almost everyone flies a logi and tbh this game for the longest time has been numbers  skill
i do so love these i fail at eve ccp save me proposals i remember an ahax fleet i was in over the summer where our logi wing was absolutely devastated in short order when our enemy turned out to be fitting short range weapons painters and webs on their battlecruisers or another fight where our logis were barely effective because the enemy brought a lot of scorpions to the fight or another where they were hugely alphaheavy and our logi chain simply couldnt keep up with the incoming alpha and by the time someone broadcast and we got them locked up and got a rep cycle on them they were probably dead but obviously ccp needs to intervene

what the  were they thinking
you should let them know if microtransactions go through they dont have the money excuse and as for manpower im sure the community is more than willing to step in and help out just in watching things from the starcraft community there are streams going practically every night and casters doing things for free etc etc im almost certain there are people in eve willing to help out in such ways
yeah t3s need to be able to mine too
i support the ideabut i agree that it needs to have less returns compared to the hulk so that hulk miners like me wont feel frustrated think about it it takes a lot of training time and isk to be able to fly a hulk let alone the modules and crystalsmaybe with a t3 exhumer it could offer some defenses that the hulk doesnt offer what the hulk lacks in defenses it makes up for it in yield with a t3 exhumer what it lacks in mining yield it could make up for it in warp strength like the skiff along with better resistance or maybe even able to use electronic counter measures
well support ofc but i would say it should be able to outmine a hulkwhy 1 itUFFFDs tech iii  tech iii is supposed to be better than t22 losing a tiii ship comes with losing sp that makes it more expensive to lose onefurther i would suppose it has a lesser cargohold than a hulk to avoid that new ship being misused as a ganksafe afk empire haulermaybe a warpstrength of about 3 and the possibility for a nullifier sub to give it a chancefor some reasons mining barges are usually primaries probably because they donUFFFDt shoot back  i suppose itUFFFDs a thing like ppl with small es that own big gunsthen iUFFFDd propose it has some real bonus on gas cloud harvesting not like that 15 secondscycle you get with a 100m implant in your headlast point would be that it should have either a good sensor strength so it would be hard to scan down or it should have a cruiserlike aligntime ships descriptionsoon after the mysterious and dangerous wormhole space was discovered people began to build ships from salvage part from that strange ancient species called the sleeper drones while these drones were at first considered to be perfect fighter drones it took some time until bougale baille highest level ore agent could get his hands on some of these sleeper salvage parts he quickly discovered that sleeper drones had some way superior mining and processing facilities inbuilt probably with the purpose of replicating and replacing damaged drones and he began to reverse engineer that technologyfollowing the earlier constructions of sleeperbased ships he began developing the insert new hull name here creating a master piece of mining equipment
supportedall good ideas i would like to have something better then the hulk smaller configurable faster specialized for dangerous places sort of a small killer mining bargelots of skills needed also very expensive but somehow better then the old tech ii hulk something what you would expect from a tech iii ship
i support a t3 exhumer how the hell are the sleepers getting the stuff to build more ships that we are blowing up
dear evei am a big fan of the assault ships and i am glad that the fourth bonus has been submitted as a priority but i would like to share my idea of what some of the fourth bonusses should bejaguar  the jaguar is a great ship but when you look at the stats of a vagabond compared to a cynabal they are quite similar the cynabal being superior in most areas i think that the same should be said about the jaguar when you compare it to a dramiel now i love the current bonuses the jaguar gets and the slot arrangement and everything but one thing stands out  the speed the jaguar while fast isnt that fast with a microwarpdive equipped the jaguar only goes 200ms faster than the vagabond my idea is to nerf the base speed of the jaguar and for the fourth bonus give it a bonus to max velocity again im not trying to make it as fast as a dramiel i am just saying that instead of going 2600ms with a microwarpdrive somewhere in the region of 3100  3200 ms would be a better dealishkur  the ishkur is almost perfect as it is but the ishtar gets a bonus to drone hitpoints and damage i think that would be a little bit overkill on the ishkur so a simple bonus to drone damage no hitpoints would be optimalwolf  the wolf is a devastating gunboat my idea for the wolf is to give a tracking speed bonus the rest of the assault ships i am not sure about but these are my ideas for these three assault ships
if youve got a better idea shout it out please also supported
the last thing the jaguar needs is more speed
nope the first thing the jaguar needs is more speed
wheres the support wheres the fire
i love the wolf if it got a tracking bonus id be pretty damn happy id say flip the optimal falloff bonus between the wolf jaguar as well a 300 dps wolf w 12km of falloff or a 240 dps wolf w 18km of falloff is close to op
there is already a thread about thisa link to that thread can be found in the hot topics of the assembly hallplease do not post multiple topics of the same subject and keep all suggestions to the original thread
my jag does 4167ms before any speed implants or gang boostsno change necessaryum no nuff said if you arent tracking then you should l2flygreat so you boost the 3 ships that are already best in class and offer no suggestions for the ships that are broken in the class n1not supportededit k trolled
looks like someone agrees with you
greetingsi fully agree and understand why a wreck can be freely salvaged by anyone without being aggressed to the wreck owner however what i have never managed to fully understand is why a wreck belongs to the mission owner if anyone else kills that npc i just dont understand the mechanics of this and furthermore i cannot see how it fits into the game  it does not make sense to me anywayi would like to propose this be reverted to its original position whereby the person who destroyed the ship is marked as its owneri know this is probably asking alot but if you dont ask you dont getmany thankskro
they see me krollinthe hatin
i may be wrong but the last time i ran a mission in a mixed corp fleet the wrecks were tied back to the corp of the fleet member that got the final blow on the npc not the person who started the missionhas that been changedor am i misunderstanding what youre saying
i did someone elses fw mission the other nightthey had bugged out and were not even in localall the wrecks i created belonged to themnot sure when it changed or even if it was a bug
maybe its a fw feature never seen that before  interesting
the mission runner is tasked with the objective if there exists an item that has to be acquired then it is the mission runner who must get it assigning ownership to them makes sense from this standpoint imo if a 3rd party comes into the mission like a ninja or a ransomergriefer they can destroy the objective drop target and swipe it wo any penalty if ownership isnt tied to the mission runner who accepted the mission the mission runner is then left to attack the ninja and be concorded for their attempt to reclaim their objective or face having to pay a ransom to get back their objectivedoing what you ask just makes this griefingransoming a riskless pursuit for the grieferransomer not that a pve ship has much chance to stand up to a pvp ship in the first place but there is no reason i see to make it even safer for themnot supported
supported
oops
regardless of whether the requirement is stupid or not it is still the requirement and until that requirement changes i cant support the ideadont misunderstand me  i like the idea  i think it would certainly help add flavor to the game you could even make it cost a few  to cover the time to review them and thin out the bulk submission idiotsbut unless ccps process for doing so changes its unfeasible so i cant support it let me know if you get confirmation that ccp is willing to change their process and ill change my vote in a heartbeat hint hint csm
its the end game just not how you wanted it as things stand super capitals are the most powerful weapons systems in eve the only counter to a large number of super capital ships is another large group of super capital ships super capitals beat everything this is not a good state for the game to be in as it drives every player towards flying these ships in the end there is no path of gameplay beyond that of supercapitals nor any alternative to how they affect the areas of gameplay they are active in super capitals desperately need to be brought back into the balanced fold before they ruin the gamefollowing the discussion generated by the thread supercapitals are broken and i have no idea how to fix them within that venue and in others several fixes for the imbalances caused by super capital class ships in 00 warfare have been proposed collected here are some of the various possibilities justifications for their inclusion and any potential problems many of these fixes will only be effective when applied in tandemgeneral capital ship related changesadd subsystem targetting to super capital class vesselsthis change would be the most effective means of balancing super capital class vessels subsystems would be seperately targettable components of super capital class weapons with independent hit point bars as well as signature radiuses by disabling any given subsystem through depletion of hit points the associated system of the ship ceases to function if the engines are targetted the ship would be immobilized and unable to warp if the jump drive is targetted the ship would be unable to jump out of system by hitting the drone bay more drones would not be able to be launched by repairing these different subsystems possibly through the use of scripts on capital repair modules lost capabilities can be restored to the damaged ship this is by far the most complex change proposed and would require implementation as an expansion feature the ultimate intent of this change is to make supercarriers vulnerable to crippling by cruiser sized and smaller vessels thus restoring the validity of using smaller ship support fleets in large scale capital driven combatjump driver timersas things stand once a jump drive is activated any capital class ship will begin a very rapid trip to their destination this makes it very easy to perform hot drop style attacks with supercarriers and titans and makes it very difficult for either side of an engagement to exercise a response to the new developments on the field not surprisingly capitals are a very popular weapon for surprise attacks but they are being utilized to the point of absurdity it is not unheard of for a single tackled mining barge to be hot dropped by a fleet of carriers anxious for a kill to change this all capitals would require a charge up time before they actually tunnel their way into the next solar system for a carrier or a super carrier this would take from one to two minutes from the pressing of jump to arrival for titans and jump freighters these timers should probably be in the range of two minutes or moreas an interesting and optional corollary to this suggestion if a super capital were to be tackled during this deployment time damage could be incurred for the energy discharge of the aborted jump the closer the targetted ship was to jumping the more damage it takes this would undermine unsupported super capital operations but could be compensated for by using more super capitals in conjunction unless implemented alongside other changes
supercarrier related changesincrease the signature radius of fighter bombers by 35 to 70 metersthe intent of this change is to make fighter bombers a more viable target for a support fleet by increasing their signature radius the time to target acquisition decreases turret tracking improves and missiles strike for greater damage it is possible that this would simply increase the proliferation of drakes and armor hac gangs in 00 fleets if this change is not implemented in conjunction with othersdecrease fighter bomber speedthis change serves similar function to the increase in signature radius in allowing turrets and missiles to strike these drones more effectively more importantly this change increases the time required for a new target to be attacked by a wing of fighter bombers reducing their effectiveness in fleet combatdecrease fighter bomber damage outputby reducing the overall effectiveness of fighter bombers as a weapons system they become less of a swiss army knife tool against capital targets however this changes affects could be reverted simly by deploying a greater number of supercapitals to the field as a result this is a lower priority change to implement and should only be done in conjunction with othersmake fighter bombers ineffective against sovereignty structuressovereignty warfare is a grind to lessen that grind firepower and fleet sizes have been growing larger and larger while hit point bars continue to grow in tandem to prevent the struggle from ending too soon this is an unsustainable game design technique and a new strategy is needed to this end fighter bombers should not be an effective weapons platform against sovereignty structures as things stand supercarriers are too much of a swiss army knife removing the anti structure effectiveness of fighter bombers will discourage the deployment of these ships en masse when a more powerful antistructure weapon is available to the fleet to prevent migration to titans this change would need to be implemented in conjunction with a reduction in titan turret damage output discussed latertitan related changesreduce titan turret damage output to sieged dreadnought levelsat present titans provide superior firepower as well as superior disengagement options when compared to dreadnought class ships in conjunction with fighter bombers this has rendered the dreadnought all but irrelevent in serious sovereignty warfare and risks marginalizing the class completely in the future as super capital volumes continue to increase to help prevent this the damage output of titans usign their turrets should not exceed 4000 dps the intent is to revalidate the existance of the dreadnought as a weapons platform in sovereignty warfarereduce titan turret trackingat present the tracking abilities of titans are sufficient to be viable against mobile support fleets including armor hac gangs at their usual enagement ranges by reducing the tracking of these turrets smaller ships that are smart enough to keep their mobility up will not be able to be blasted right off the field by an alpha strike from a titans turrets with the intent of forcing fleets fielding titans to utilize them in conjunction with a support fleet oriented more towards small scale ship to ship combat this goal would be much more readily attained when implemented along side subsystem targetting
the targeting idea is not something i like you basically want to completely render the ship useless too op imhoi do agree with some sort of delay on jumping but this should be across all capital shipsthe new changes to fighter bombers already lowers the damage output to sub capital class ships i dont agree to your changefighterbombers already die quite quickly if a gang is organised and can focus fire again i dont agree to your changelets face it a simple jump delay would be the best bet
add a jump portal timer to all ship classessimilar to the aforementioned jump drive timer the jump portal timer would create a buffer between initiating titan portal travel and arrival on the field for small ships such as frigates this timer would have no effect on their deployment cruisers could arrive 5 to 10 seconds later and battlecruisers and battleships follow suit in 10 to 15 seconds carriers super carriers other titans freighters jump freighters and other future capital class ships would require a minute or more to utilize the jump portal identical to their jump drive time requirementsadd tracking to the titan doomsday deviceas things stand the titan doomsday can hit any target it can lock onto as a result it often is used on frivolous targets and can allow the ship to be deployed without proper support with tracking as a factor the doomsday will not be able to be used against any given target such as an interdictor effectively while retaining the weapons intended use against carriers and other capital shipsnoncapital ship changesreduce or remove the effectiveness of massed bombs against small targetssupport fleets especially on heavily loaded nodes tend to suffer tremendously against a well orchestrated bombing run these bombs are effective against all ship classes en mass to make support fleets viable massed bombs need to be all but useless against targets smaller than destroyers and only modestly effective against cruisers an explosion velocity penalty modifier would probably provide sufficient change but i do not know what numbers or other modifications might be necessary to make these weapons work properly an insufficiently orchestrated change may allow for pilots to simply overcompensate for reduced effectiveness with increased numbers so this change should be made with consideration of this in mind
moved to assembly hall by request
and to make sure you dont get the wrong idea this is not one of those increase the number of systems proposalseve travel should imo take longer why well minigin explained that nice and as aditional bonus not in green herenow here comes a bit more extended proposalconventional travelthis is not really a problem there are only two things i would change decrease bs warp speed to 2 aus to make them significantly slower than cruisers also as requested quite often make the acceleration curve depend on the top warp speed right now the distance and the time you spend acceleratingdeaccelerating during the warp is always equal it wouldnt be really strange if your acceleration is two times larger if your max warp speed is two times larger the end result is then if your warp speed is two times larger you just end up at your destination two times faster ignoring alligning might mean that some ships with very high warp speeds need to be toned down a bitslightly related to conventional travel make extra empire connections with deep 00 regions the goal here is to make the ability to blob everything you see harder not to make logistics a giant pita also just more gate connections arround choke points to compensate for higher importance of gate traveljump clonesyou can go from one side of the universe to the other side with the press of a button every 24 hours that is just too often if your alliance decided to fight at the other side of the universe you shouldnt just jc back to defend your own space and still be able to 24 hours later join the fighting at other side againyet at the same time you dont want to stop people pvping because they dont want to use their expensive implants solution make the jc timer distance dependant random numbers make short range jumps give you a jc timer of 8 hours in station for example significantly less than 24 at least however if you decide to jc from bottom of the map to top of the map you get a timer of several days medical clonesi dont see them as much of an issue but then i am too greedy to selfdestruct my pod possible solution to remove ability to set medical clone to another station than your current station not sure though feedback welcome
jump drives and titan bridgesone of the main issues these allow for so much faster travel than conventional travel that it just doesnt make sense they were ever introduced in their current form cruisers travel slower than frigates battleships slower than cruisers  ooh why not introduce giant super caps that travels much faster than battleships some random ideas first decrease their jump range or as alternative increase distances and then make constellation distances significantly larger while distances between regions becomes enormous ammount larger range between systems within a constelation can stay the same this way you prefer not to move them multiple regions without a good reason making jump fuel more expensive or more required is imo a bad idea as you mainly hurt the scrub with his carrier and not the supercapital fleets aditionally give capitals possibly a warm up for their jump drive honestly kinda unrelated to this proposal is an anti hotdrop thingie and certainly a much longer cool down period 10 minutes so you can jump dreads to destination siege kill jump back but you cannot jump to midpoint dock undock jump dock undock jump be 4 regions further in a couple of minutes important note jfs should be largely unaffected so short cool down period and improved jump range if distances are increased while i would enjoy that logistics becomes a challenge and not right mouse button jump i am afraid if you make it too much a challenge you just get terribly boring corp ops for escorting freighters combined with waste lands of stuff that is too far for logistics to bother however more locally produces goods would be nice instead of importing everything from jitajump bridgesthese of course also need to be mentioned again we got the issue that these are also important for the general logistics needs of random scrub in random alliance i dont want to make their live in 00 so tedious they go back to high sec they will also be hit by the range increase between systems you can also decrease their fuel capacity so it becomes more of a logistics issue for large fleets to have enough fuel major problem you can just keep the fuel in the nearby pos in a canhangar stuff like increasing fuel consumption if multiple activations in certain time frame is possible but becomes too complicated imo and just limitting number of activations like 10minute is an option but kinda restrictive what definately should happen imo is an increase in resistances of jbs while severely decreasing their ehp so they become much easier to incap while also easy to rep up afterwards something else that has been proposed before is just removing them completely from poss especially possible since dominion with a special upgrade required for bridges for my part you just even show them on the overview just like a gate however if you do that combined with ehp decrease i would make them incap when shields are down combined with fairly high shield recharge so they start functioning automatically again after a while only alliance members is too restrictive imo and when busy they should make jump bridges but also pos shield access standing related to get mostly rid of the pos pw crap
well thought out ill give you the thumbs up but i disagree and think that alliance only use of things like jbs and titans is not too restrictive it is only because we have gotten so used to cheating the system with out of ally alts and blues that it seems harsh if we take it awaybut realistically why should someone with standings be able to use an jb not owned by their alliance where is the logic behind that if they want to use the same jbs they should be in the same alliance the benefits should be directly related to what your alliance holds not what your friends alliances holdyou should have the choice get the benefits of being in said alliance or not you decide this having everything is getting old and i think its about time someone started making a fuss
although afk cloaker is reasonable nerf it is still the only way to populate null space
i can get behind adjustments of these things
one point i would add is limiting the instant intel if you would need to check systems more carefully to find hostilesvictims you cant just rush through 50 systems in one night as you might miss all kills
make the warp travel more capacitor consuming agree with warp speed adjustment for ships
i agree with minigins post more than the op i think jump bridges both on poss and titans should be limited to the alliance those things belong to i also disagree with the jump clone aspect not many people utilize them in an effective way of crossing across space to fight it very rarely happens that way but furthermore with all the different types of implants in the game its nice to be able to be in a clone that matches the situation whether its slaves or snakes personally i would like to see a reduction in the timer if anything
euhm that is included in the proposal if you just use it for changing implants the timer can be much shortermy problem with limitting stuff to alliance only is that it is an artificial limit that limits the sandbox and that it pretty much forces smaller entities to merge with larger ones
consequences do not limit the sandbox it makes your decisions actually worth making
maybe if you have lots of free time to play eve these ideas might make sensebut if you only have a few hours each night then these proposals are ridiculoustravel allready takes up to much of my game time for my liking
i agree to the change in warp speed increasing and decreasing change kinda weird to me the only time the max warp speed actually affects the warp time right now is when doing a very long warp but those are very rare for me also i would suggest having multiple types of jcs with the types depending on skills and standings the basic version would require only low skills and the same 80 standings but the jump timer for them would be greater and as you increase standings and skills you get access to the better jump clones which have better clone jump reset timersi also think the number of highsec systems should be increased high sec is getting to crowded about a year back the systems i frequent adveraged at about 15 players but not they adverage about at 60 players
1 having reduced travel speed would make it much harder to hold larger chunks of space i am quite sure the number of people who would do 6hours trips to get from deklein to lets say geminate just to help defending there and then going back for 6hourspeople might do that once or twice and then start ignoring such ops2 that said  it might shrinkbreak up the larger blocks over time and you get more regional conflicts and especially room for others to take3 and suddenly you might see more regional conflicts with just 300400 in local at most and not 12001300 and you might see more redneutral people close by so you dont have to travel 2030jumps through blue space to find any
yep exactly eve just needs to be more boring than it is now
that is only when you feel the need to travel 5 regions every day up and down to fight someone the entire idea is that that is too boring so you dont gather an entire coalition spanning 10 regions to fight a single alliance for general travel in a region not much would change biggest change would most likely be jump bridges but the vast majority in eve manage to do their travelling needs without them i think you will handle it if they are a bit worse also the only ships actually becoming slower for normal travel ie gates would be bs all other ships would either stay the same or become faster every ship with a warp speed above 3 aus would actually travel faster in this proposal
supported sounds like a great idea i think it would add a bit more realism to the game or at least make it a bit more like what i think space combat should be like
this also supporting

from my experience in using the drake i have found these to be false 1 even tho a drake can hit a target with its missiles speedy targets and smaller targets dont get enough damage hit on them by the missiles to do enough damage to fix that you would need a web and a target painter wooh there went some passive tank 2 another weakness is that drakes are very specified ships most ships allow you to do a varity of things like gas harvesting mining guards or even light logistics drakes cant do that becuase they have no turret slots and their cap is almost none existent you have to use missiles and a good tank 3 another thing the dps upgrades for a drake require medium low and rig slots for medium you will be using a web target painter for low you will be using bcus and the rigs various missile rigs now your down 2 medium a few low and your rig slots so now your tank is weaker than other bss also in pvp it is almost a requirement to use a mwd so there go another medium slot when flying a drake a player must first chose if they want weak tank but high dps low dps and high tank or somewhere in the middle from the description you gave you mixed your experience with a tanking drake and a dps drake i say the drake is perfectly balanced the way it is even with the current power grid and cpu if i fit a full tank i cant fit all the missile launchers causing the damage to fall yes i know in can fix the missle launcher situation but i dont feel like training 30 days just to do it
oh my god rick you are my hero can i join your corp cause you know how to fit a ham drake i dont think anyone knows how to fit a ham drake properly and you just have ambient awesomeness im in total and utter awe of you can i have your babiespoint being someone said you cant have good dpstankmed neuttackle on a drake all i did was throw a fit together in a flash to prove that you canedit top tip if you are only gonna fit a small neut use a small nos instead that way when you are being neuted you can keep your tackle on small neuts are pretty weak
1 op please do tell which caldari ship would be viable for solo pvp if you take a drake out of the picture2 you have never flown a drake in your pvp career so this post is saying nerf ships that i dont use so i can kill them more easily3 hurricane or cyclone can chew a drake easily in 1vs1 fight you would certainly like the drake nerf since you are mainly a minmatar pilot4 armor hacs can obliterate drake fleets already5 for a decent drake fit you already need kmb25 implant even with maxed out skills the alternative to that fit is another one that requires powergrid implant
definately supportedlook at my name
next time dont put your cat on the keyboard when you get to that part of the process
while at it make it also show whether the character has been traded or not
i think this should be a seperate proposal tbh and i would support it in a heartbeat maybe a trade history tab on the character that lists all the dates that character has changed accounts you dont even need to show me the from or to  i really dont care just give me a list of dates
you make it then xi dont really know how the character trade works along with how people get their intel looking for when joining a specific corp which is the reason this popped into my headi only know that scammers could use it to repair their reputation if they have money too much 
name change documentation is so hard to fill outsurely theyve expedited the process since the dmv came alongsupported
i agree i would be happy if i could just chose a pattern and a colors for the pattern some costumablility is needed in this subject although the factionpirate paints should be reserved for only faction ships to deterr an increase in scams
supported id like to personalize my ships and a few options that add virtually zero lag would be finebut i recommend that the option for a hot pink thorax not be included even if it is named fun when vibrating
yes supported
why not
ive been thinking about this for a while and everyone i talk to agrees the null sec need a form of defense besides players also having a defence upgrade for your null sec systems would control how much protection you can getidea one have a deployable gun that can be deployed on stations belts or gates that it like the t2 version of the pos guns the number of guns would be restricted on your defense upgrade but each cosmic item would have its max number of turrets it can have on it like a station can have 8 max a gate can have 6 max and a belt can only have 1 or 2 but the total number possible in a system would be pretty low and would increase with defense upgrades these guns would have a slow locking speed and a reaction speed how fact they react to a ship entering their systemthe reaction speed would let ships cloak when they enter a system idea two have a hireable npc group that will assist your solar system this npc group could be either pirates that the alliance or corporation have high standings in or a set of automated ships that the alliance or corporation builds they work kinda like fighters and fighter bombers the defense fleets reaction time would again be slow and the number and size of the ships in the response fleet would be totally dependent on the defense upgrade of the system and only be able to respond to one instance at a time the defenses proposed above can be set to attack based on corporation or alliance standings also the defense level will be hard to get and raise so only the very serious null groups would get a large defense while other systems would have very little defense
idea one stationary guns are so laughably easy to disable that theyd never see any useidea two mercenaries
poss have guns a good alliance can build a defense fleet in minutes
definitely dont agree with this one would be another hit to solosmall warfare encourage larger gangs again increase lag and make an already hard to take system even harder if anything these systems need to be easier to take because apart from the a land grab 00 space changes hands very very rarely
if you can defend your space then you dont deserve to have itnot supported
i mean the idea to be easily laughable the defense fleet is ment for a small group harassment or noob killer and a good alliance lol thats just what they say to encourage you they actually hide in there station until the 1 red goes away yes its a pvp alliance seem kinda wimpy to me i really should have called it a defense fleet more like a weak half hearted police fleet
idea oneit will not make any difference in sov warfare because guns would be taken down the first but it will discourage attack gangs not fleets to go to a station for a casual fight this would represent the further nerf of small scale pvp and boost blob warfare which is always badidea twoplease dont mix pvp and pvenot supported

this forum is englishonly
considering the content of his post he might be native english speaker but a very drunk one
that is as true today as it was before excluding various types of fotmsi wouldnt phrase it like that fleet compositions and tactics tend to converge on a few types that have been found to work well but this evolves over time driven by game changes and the necessity to find counters to common fleet types and tacticsanother factor is that most alliances have standardized fits often coupling ship replacement programs with the requirement to use those official fits which of course makes fleets less heterogeneous fcs like you also play a role by how strictly you enforce the ship types that were called for regardless how useful a handful of other types would be well frigate sized ships have too little buffer the be used together with the common logistics based fleets also it seems today almost everybody has enough isk to fly bss and t2 shipshm apart from those main fleet components i always see cloakies for scoutingwarpins tacklers ecm boats for breaking up logistic chains command ships for bonuses and still quite a bit of antisupportsomething that i have missed in fact are nonsuper capitals involved in fleet fights which can be attributed mostly to the new doomsday once everybody does that people will rediscover sniper fleetsfiring up eft and checking a few popular cruisers the factor seems to sit roughly at 2x also the fitting requirements are such that the sacrifices you make to fit a 1600 plate are well balanced imotwo very different ship types have more or less similar range soi agree the drake is overpowered or rather too versatile but you cant say that aloud hereagreed but its hard to come up with a proposal that wouldnt require major rebalancingdestroyers suck and buffingbalancing them is a much easier task than frigates has been discussed to death in ah multiple timesi dont see a problem their offensive power was nerfed already what else do you want to take awayyou lost me therewell then why dont you write an actual proposal that we can discuss
yup
you could have it where you enter a time until you expect to be back then when somone in a chat non local says like checkstatus worvand it would say sorry he is afk and is expecting to return to his senses in 32 minutes for the roleplaying puroses the message would only be displayed to the person who wrote the check status command
supported think its a good idea
i agree but also limit the number of billboards a corporation can use and make the names of the cans either shorter or generic to anyone outside of their alliance to quit any further container advertisers
not supported gallente are probably the best pvp race stupid idea
even though blasters are somewhat limited and capacitor can not always but can be an issue im against this just because you do not use a rep bonus does not mean noone else doesthe rep bonus means gallente ships are probably the best solo pvp nonnano ships in eve if you train your capacitor skills up enough cap really is not much of an issueit would be nice to not have such a large cap penalty for mwd but i feel losing one of the other bonuses is too big a price
i agree with das goon my station warehouses are not cutting it
containers are there let them be moved no need for adding fing hangar divisions no need for adding manufacturing slots
i support having repackaged station cans smaller and ship carry ablerealistic view point its like having a giant box that takes up a lot of space when fully assembled but when repackaged its takes up alot less space due to there being less empty space in it kinda like shipping a shelf or buying moving boxes they are packaged to save room and fit in someones careve use point being able to repackage a station can and carry it arround with you wont be that much use in high sec but in low and null it would help out alot
some in fact all of the alternate formations he mentions cannot be created by standard mechanics or at least not in a fashion thats applicable in a real combat situationlines v formation even a chosen diameter sphere formation would all add to fleet combat  you could not do these by any workable mechanic and the benefits are negligible compared to the cost in time and effortif they were added as an option they would allow fleets to do new interesting things  theyd create variability in the manner in which 2 fleets collide at the moment there are two optionsblob  where the fleet is fleetwarped to a distance and lands as a clusteroptimal line  where each pilot warps to an ideal in a direct line between the source location and the target locationwhilst i dont think this is jump up and do it now stuff its a very cool idea and i think it would add to fleet combat mechanicsimagine if you could choose from the option sets given a fleet in homeworld for example would that not be visually stunning allow for new styles of combat and fit in wonderfully with the concept of eveeditmy suggested modifications to the ideadrop the tackle one  that actually reduces tactical options by suggesting an obvious default obvious in quotes because it actually might not apply much of the timemake the distances an option for the fc and allow them to choose from a better set than current at the very least every 10km from 0m to 100km
anyone who thinks bombing is hard either hasnt done it or hasnt ever seen it properly done this in no way removes armor hacs and in no way dumbs down fleets youre only looking at one side of this both sides benefit and can create new and interesting tactics this doesnt dumb down the game it adds more elements of diversity and difficulty to it the things that make good fcs good and bad fcs bad arent in any way related to warp ins at least not in any significant manner in eve honestly off the top of my head i can think of a counter maneuver to every single type of warp in up there and not only can i counter it i can totally exploit a fleet who chooses to use any of those options if youre telling me that the fcs youve flown under for years are going to improve or diminish simply by this change then youve definitely flown under the wrong people
this
yes i agree with adding a warp in design like have it so that the battleships warp in in the middle and the smaller ships further out one thing that would help is adding a customizing tool like use the way you control through scanning but you just add warp in zones or spots the warp in setting would be set by the highest ranking fleet member and when enabled the fleet warps as one group which means that the frigates would get up to warp speed but wait for the other ships to get up to warp speed then go to warp as a group in countless space related items the ships go to warp together and come out in a certain formation also as a restriction on customizing the fleet warp in design if you have 3 bs slots and like 10 frigate slots then that design can only be used in a fleet that has up to but not over 3 bss no bccruser no slots for them and in there and up to but not over 10 frigates
while you do have a point if ducks can do it why cant we
no to reusing too confusing for historical purposes and would cause a conflict with griefwatch and suchyes to adding another character or two

its realy not a bad ideal though much better bounse for pvp if i say so myself it could even be the number 1 level 5 mission ship with that bounse hehe but i do belive that all or most of the level 5s or in low sec or below now too alse making it a good bounse for both pvp and pvm bring us one more step closer to merging pvp and pvm
sounds like someone just lost there shiny marauder to a mission invader
so give a pve ship a massive boost in a pvp scenarionot supported
dont have adv weapon upgrades 5 dont have any interest in the ship the way it is now i dont do high sec warfare and thats why i want this ship to change so i can actually maraud with a marauder not training for it till something changes or i decide to get a siege moduleby calling a ship a pve ship you have utterly failed at eve onlinewhen you say that this ship can only do one thing you really are exactly the kind of narrow minded buffoons that i hatesupporting my own thread no more trolls please
given all marauders have an active tanking bonus cap should be vulnerable otherwise you would need to hold and damage it until it went through all the cap boosters and that is assuming the marauder wouldnt fit the utility highs with nos which would increase that time even more combined with the dmg potential it might have killed your whole gang before it ran out of cap boostersall that said  not supported
if you are looking to pvp in it then the neut bonus wont save you once someone chucks out ecm drones your going to get jammed alot of the time giving whoever is shooting you plenty of time to whittle down your only just better than the tech 1 bs buffer

i would like you to bring up a proposal i made in ah of posting regulations and making them similar to caod regulations ie posting with your main or a non alt character to stop the endless bs threads made by people like emo tj and chromo effectedit linkage
i just found your clever wordplay amusing if you want to call that player out you should just do it im sure he wont mind
the problem these are business decisions and no matter how loud and how many voices they hear they will probably view it as the vocal minority even in the face of a mass exit they would probably place the decline on something else other then their golden goose reading mynxees report on the last meeting i think its safe to assume csm is already in their face over the matter tambers resignation just elevated itas for lotr going f2p its way to early to start throwing a party over the numbers they just reported this is an mmo continuity is everything going to wait to call that a success story we also have champions moving to f2p cryptic style lol so that will also be interesting to watch over time if ccp wants to push out more plex purchases why dont they do something really different they have a store with physical goods why not allow me to buy something in it for plexs instead of these virtual gimmicks allow someone to actually buy physical goods using virtual money or items such as a plex do something different and unique that sets you apart from the rest of the industry
do not worry the full seated csms are all over this and me leaving will have no bearing in the overall strength of the antimoremicrotransaction movement as there is not one csm who isnt against adding more of them to gametamber
wonderful
to be more precise the csm is unanimously against microtransactions that have real ingame benefits like plex for remaps however microtransactions for vanity items or services like character portraits is an entirely different thingi think that when the october meeting report comes out rsn this will be made entirely clear
no i want backwards vectors just to  off the bittervets
bump
yes i am right cause its insurance for all or no one and i fixed it for u
noi dislike this idea enough that i actually logged into the forums which i almost never do to post against it plex is bad enough and especially dont allow people to buy only items doubly so if theyre accountbound
a resounding no
im going to do something i rarely do here  which is be serious on the forumsccp if you do decide to go ahead with microtransactions  and theyre anything but cosmetic  youll successfully do what years upon years of drama radical changes and other companies couldnt doyoull kill eve flat out many of us have put time into this game into characters corporations and friends that have been with us through all of it but we wont support a system which supports the outofgame wealth of players to better their experiencesome of us work for a living and we work hard  especially in this day and economic situation yet were still willing to pay you for the pleasure of eve most of us on multiple accountsplease dont ruin thatits a no vote from me as well chaps
nothis has been the only mmo ive played since the day i discovered itthat ccp has taken this next step without regard to its playerbase is no surprise to me i had a feeling that ccp had sold its soul to the dark side when it teamed up with microsoft for dust on a side note i will more then likely stop playing my self and play more fps and hey i hear they are patching new vegas again
no its a terrible idea and a huge step in the wrong direction
no

wtf are you thinking sims in space microtransactions no
a thousand times no
no
that will be a big fat noccp is already well ahead in the mmo lead and there is no reason why they should adopt practices from inferior companiesproducts
no
no
no  from the player base as well as from the developer point of view it makes no sense if ccp wants to introduce unique items it can do so and already did in the past by ingame events where player have to put some effort into it to get it
cosmetic only paying extra for a little bit of extra comfort is fine by me  but it should neither be required or strongly suggested
ccps monthly subs are already 2040 more than other mmos this may be because of the introduction of shops or microtransactions in those games but the idiots suggesting i would rather they increased my subs than bring in extra stuff i can pay for can take a jump off a very high cliffits already difficult enough to play eve with 1 account increasing subs is a stupid idea please do not put this in ccps headnow cutting subs by 50 introducing the shop with attribute adjustmentslearning implant purchasecosmetics for plexrl iskiesgo right ahead modulesships which give clear advantages ingame no though
cosmetic only as long as it gives no advantage ingame i dont careit will probably make plexs more useful and thus increasing its price but guess what its a tradable good and price increasedecrease is normalive no more sympathy for someone who wont be able to buy a plex for his 3rd account than i have for the miner who lost his hulk to griefers

oh man you guys have no clue i was just at ccps head office and they have this super dramiel i think its called a machariet yes with a t anyway it has the same play style as the dramiel but with double the shields structure and damage bonus and you can only get it by directly converting plex into it it is so uberedit do not get me started on the vindicator mk ii carrierlevel level tank with no mods double the web range and a bigger damage bonus omfg it has effectively 16 guns and trades for 3 plexno
no
no
not only no but hell noooo
cosmeticthere is not reason to have no option at all there is almost no detriment to cosmetic changes for plex  plex prices will go up but who caresthose saying no are butthurt or scared that this will turn into pay2winonlineeven if you can pay to get a super dramiel you would pay with a plex which is about 360mil which is easily acquired through current game mechanics

if no boost ever comes is it not reasonable to simply cut their cost in half im looking at 17m hyena hulls the eaf i wanted to fly and considering the total number of active eafs in game that is beyond ridiculous id fly an underpowered roleconfused ship if it were half the price i mean im just saying eitheror
the problem with the hyena is that it is simply does not do anything well its bonuses cry out for a mwd if you look at the recommended skills you can see that artillery and armor tanking are recommended for it the hyena can go as slow at 2550ms if you slap a 400mm plate on it or as fast as 3300ms if you shield tank it the latter has a massive 286m signature radius w mwd on 4800 ehp is what you can get w the 400mm plate 3k ehp is pretty standard against cruisers and larger ships  absolutely no problem tracking it none anyone who has remotely trained gunnery will kill you while laughingagainst frigates you have no firepower to speak of 88 dps is the most i could configure for at the speed frigates move  by the time you slap webs on an incoming adversary theyve closed the last 10km to put a scramble on you  and youre mwd fitted caw caw bang  im dead i have eas trained to lvl 5 i spent alot of time on sissi trying to work out fits that would work trust me the ship is worthless and i dont care how cheap it is  5 seconds on the battlefield is not enough
it would be nice to see more of these flying around1

it always baffles me that people havent figured out how to fit the keres properly its already a very useful little ship its a mini arazu that can tackle any non sensor boostered sub capital not including recons with immunity to being locked back hint small cap injectorhowever in general i support this proposal
id buy that for a dollar
indeed the omen has some serious fitting problems even the omen navy issue has problems with fitting a boost in powergrid and cpu is definitely need for the omen and the omen navy issue the zealot is fine infact the omen navy issue should have around a similar fitting as the zealot
supported the omen is a ship i have never even thought about flying pvp in because of its awful fitting abilities
fix all nontier3 cruisers pleasecaracal nice range too bad everyone will just warp out before your missiles hitomen could survive barely in the nano age now its just ughhhstabber no real hp frigate dps not fast enough anymore not to mention people will just shut off your your mwd and then no real hp turns into a wreckthorax used to be good at what it does get to 0 range dps hope other guy dies before you do i havent seen any in a very long time though so i dunno if it still works
the omen is not a dmg bonused laser boat its a dps bonused laser boat check the stats  it gets a rate of fire bonus no range bonus which would allow you to use shorter range crystals no damage bonus no tracking bonus it also gets more drones than the zealot or omen both these features point to it being a great pve boat obviously not designed for pvpyoull have the same trouble trying to fit t2 short range weaponry on any t1 hull while still squeezing in damage mods tank and tackle something has to give  you cant have one hull capable of fielding awesome dps and being tackle and tankomen navy issue zealot or harbinger will let you fit all that junk onto one hull
youll have the same trouble trying to fit t2 short range weaponry on any t1 hull while still squeezing in damage mods tank and tackle something has to give  you cant have one hull capable of fielding awesome dps and being tackle and tankomen navy issue zealot or harbinger will let you fit all that junk onto one hulllike the rupture moa caracal stabber vexor thorax but not really cause they can all fit tackle tank t2 short range guns
there are a lot of t1 cruisers from other races that dont absolutely suck just because of horribly gimped fittings it is not too much to ask for fmp1600 or hpl800 to fit on an omen it would still be significantly worse than a rupture for example and i wouldnt hesitate to engage it in a vexor arbitrator or thoraxliang

i dont know if this has been posted before but i was thinking it would be really great if one could set or change your skill queue on eve gate that makes it way easier to not waste skill time if you dont have am eve pc near bythe skill list is already there it just need to be made interactivewhat do you think any ideas to that matter

100 with you on that onemy eve pc crashed just last week and now i have to get a new one if it wasnt that my friend is an eve player i would have not been able to update my skill queue i would also suggest a live chat room integrated with eve online to speak with friends who are playing eve this would be awesome cause sometimes im extremely bored at work
i suppose its already on their to do list for eve gate as it seems obvious but well if they have forgotten

yes please the sovgrind is mind numbing and boring it kills the soul there is a place for siege warfare but grinding through a load of timers is just bad gameplay
not supportedthere will be no sov mechanic you will be happy with if it remains this easy to stick a billion people in a system whenever you wantyour problem isnt with sov its with jbsstandings
so we need to vote that ccp is doing their job if i dont vote what are they doing then  working on other games yes i want them start working and doing their job fix that and all what is broken in this game if you care about it
well grinding with massive fleets through a wall of hp isnt that funnywhat about a module on a ship that can take over sovlets say every reinforce cycle the firewalls of the ihubs and outpost are down for 30 minutes or so rebooting during that time somebody has to go there and activate the hacking module for 15 minutes and upload a programm to start the next rf cycle to finaly conquer the computer systems of the ihubto initiate the first rf cycle they have to stay and hack there for 30 minutes and the owning alliance gets a warning so no sov can be stolen when nobody watches and small gangs can provoke a responsemain problem would be massive lag so that not all hacking ships can be destroyed in the timeframeanother smaller problem could also be small ships that ran around and start hacking so you get a lot of warnings but nothing is contested but well space has to be denfended or you dont deserve it
sov seems fine to me now they way its gained and lost one thing i would like to see implemented though is a the creation of a coalition just like you would do an alliance instead of alliances messing around with standings and making chat rooms etc also with complete managemnt tool where the coatiltion executor alliancecorp can have control idk what else but yea
again i must ask why the winners have control and the losers go back to high sec just because you are horrible at winning 00 does not mean you get to run to the judges and have the rules changed to suit your play styleyou lost time to move on ehh why dont you sleep with a dev about it oh wai

i dont think anyone is suggesting that we make eve slower just make it slower for enourmous numbers to move places far away
what a surprise yet again youre unable to deal with a basic game mechanic and ccp must save you heres a suggestion if theres a jump bridge network thats letting your enemies run rings around you funny that the people who are complaining are always those who cant get their own network set up or enough allies to make a large one workwhy dont you try shooting it i know revolutionary concept but your enemys jb network can be get this incapacitated i know those pos modules are strangely enough able to be shot at and theyre not magic and invulnerable whod a thunk it and naturally a large force of allied groups that wants to move a lot of people somewhere cant possibly use titans and cynos or maybe they can but ccp should probably save you from that too any other valid game mechanics giving you problems i heard that ccp is even thinking about adding something to the game called jump clones so that an entire enemy force could simply jump clone over to where they want to be yes even across the entire map we need to stop them before they do that as it will obviously totally ruin eve keep up the good work and post in a brighter green if you can all the most compelling arguments either use bright colors or if theyre a good argument all caps if theyre really a good argument they can use all caps and bold at the same time perhaps you can raise your game to the level where you post in all caps bolded underlined bright colors then the only thing left for you to do would be to add italics and your arguments would be unbeatable
you created a monster
i wasnt going to agree with you and i really dont want to but i see that text and i just cant help myself
assuming that lag is currently ccp biggest problem i would have thought that they already would have changed jump bridges as stated earlier the simple solutions arejump bridges only allow alliance members to jumpmake it so only 1015 activation are allowed per minute this should reduce load on the server give a negative effect for those ships jumping through over the activation allotment such as inability to lock jump through bridges or warp for 510 minuteslarge coalition gangs should be moved by titans not via jump bridgeshopefully changes in jump bridges will increase gate travel which will allow for servers to better cope with large gangs save a jump bridge ride a gatecorps
is it a surprise to anyone the tickers of the people claiming its perfectly valid to be able to move 1000 guys accross half of eve in 10 minsand if you have read the other thread people have already suggested and i agree with titan bridges only being alliance use alsoplease explain to me what is so unreasonable about this proposal why cant it be up to the alliance you reside in to arange its own transportwhy should this exist
no seriously everybody else who wants to deal with an enemy jb network and is competent can shoot them but you need ccp to rescue you because you are just so damn awesome of course and total unexpcted from a troll such as yourself weve got some ad homnem fallacies amidst the whiny for ccp to save you while meanwhile everybody else who wants an enemy jb network shut down will ya know form up a fleet rather than forum warrioring and begging ccp to save them from anybody who can hold space or gasp cooperate with their neighbors
its a good thing that jbs are 1 not on heavily defended posses  no wait2 not enabeling massive and fast responce times to any attack on them  no wait3 when shot actually die  no wait4 not ridiculously easy to repair  no wait5 not cheep enough to have hundreds friggin everywhere so that killing a few of them isnt that much of a problem  no waitexplain to me why you think it is unreasonable that the benefits you derive from holding space should be directly proportionate to the amount of space you actually hold and i might consider your argument not a mear please dont change this i really like exploiting it
yet again your argument is about how powerless you say you are and how much you need ccp to save you you cant incap mods you cant reinforce towers you cant kill your enemies when they try to rep things you definitely cant destroy those jb towers you certainly can not deny your enemy sov and gosh darn you just cannot understand why an alliance or coalition that owns more space should be able to use more space and of course jump bridges are an exploit too
if you remove jump bridges youll have to redesign sov again as defending space is heavily dependent on being able to use jump bridges
me grabs popcorn
i am asking you a very simple question which you have smokescreenedwhy should razor alliance be able to use morsus mihis jumpbridgesare you aware you cant use their cynogenslet me guessthis game is not easy enough for you yet sitting in the largest group of blues in the game being able to put two seperate 1k gangs into different regions at the drop of a hat and you are the one telling people to adapt or dieif this game becomes reasonable and you cant abuse jumpbridges so badly i wonder how you will adapt
basic lesson in logic burden of proofother than whining about how impotent you are to fight enemies who has poss and deal who enemy poss so ccp has to save you you havent shown a reason why people shouldnt be able to use friendly jbstitans i dont have to show why the entire system of sovereigntybridgescybo hammersbeaconstitans doesnt need a radical overhauland yet more whining and trolling about how in an mmo of all places gasp people can work together and if more people oppose you than work with you its just not faaaaaair also ayieeeee blob blobby mcblobbersob
just for the record rawr is burning between 10 and 15 billions in lo exclusively on jbs every month proly more cause we cant keep the track of everyone refueling them also we are not maybe the best example cause good portion of north is using our jb network but maintaining jb network is far from cheapi must admit i wouldnt mind balancing them in one way or another but minigin is funny when he is buthurt
but infact we have and you have not come up with a counter argument you have just ranted about trolling  limegreen  caodill go through it again with you1 it is too easy to move extremely large numbers through vast regions of space this allows for stagnation of 00 space and largely boring conflicts2 benefits derived from holding space  owning titans should be directly proportionate to what you actually have3 if you want to be in a megaalliance with jumpbridges over half of eve you should be in the same alliance and have to deal with the structural problems with forming a superallianceps at this stage you need to ask in a wide eyed manner but why cant i have it allto which i shall reply haha you want easymode why dont you adapt or die no sorry thats your linei will say there are consequences for your choices eve should and used to mirror this it was  is an excellent part of our game and should not be lost because a large group of players gets together and says hey guys if there are enough of us our choices wont matteri put it all in caps and underlinedbolded important bits so you dont miss it this time
what way would you balance them and does this mean they are imbalanced in your eyes
man mini you really suck at logical augments none of those support the burden of proof your fist claim is mere subjective opinion too fast according to which objective metric exactly your argument is circular jbs are bad because you feel that the make travel too fast and them making travel too fast makes them bad plus of course you insist that you are too impotent to counter them so ccp has to save youyour second point is short bus level dumb the more space people hold the more they can use and yet youre still whining about how instead it should be that the more space someone holds the more they can useyour third point isnt even a cogent argument just petulant whining alliances shouldnt be able to cooperate and share bridges because you say so and waaah waaah and you are powerless and zomg please wont ccp save you and blah blah plus added nonsense about how something essential is lost if ccp doesnt remedy your impotence and its other people who want eve on easy mode ya know the folks who actually fight over and destroy poss an remove sob and not you who are impotent to fight and need mommy ccp to fix it and the war in the drone regions has been quite interesting its a good thing that ccp wouldnt let them anchor any jbs or it would be really stagnant we sure dodged a bullet there just like how sov 4 was unbeatable until someone beat itand i keep talking about how youre trolling caod style crap posting and using pretty colored text like a child because well you wont stop any of the three
so only 23 tech moons i feel really sorry for you with all those highends and techmoons you got you might run out of money soon
1 it is too fast i think even vuk is about to agree there that traveling through such large areas of space so quickly with such large numbers makes little sense and makes this game far more easy for large entities note that it wouldnt stop being easier for these entities than smaller entites should jbs be drawn back just not so much easier2 your alliance doesnt hold all the north your alliance holds slabs of tenal yet you are able to jumpbridge all over the north via blue alliances jumpbridges i would argue that this shouldnt be the case because you incur none of the costs  risks eg should someone want to wardec an alliance so to block your supply routes or whatever using alts and whatever with blue standings has in the past hindered the effectiveness of such wars by limiting jb use to alliances only you are forced to make a tough choice one i believe to be fair you can gain the benefits of being in an alliance with jbs but also will incur the not so blissful side of things the problem with people like you is you believe and atm rightly so that you can have everything and will never need to make a difficult choice but why is this the case eve is not a fluffy peaceful empire where there is only consentual pvp or in this case only pvp when you dictate it there is absolutely nothing unreasonable with any of thisalso i dont think you understand quite what burden of proof means it is actually a legal term and the burden of proof doesnt reside with the person you decide it is usualy decided by either legislation or something like a high courtas you are neither but might believe yourself to be and as i have given ample justification for this to be looked into it really now comes down to why you should be able to use another alliances jumpbridge unlike their cynogens and simply saying why not is a really stupid answer the fact that in none of your replys thus far have you been able to avoid rambling in such a way as zomg please wont ccp save you and blah blah proves imo that you have no interest in actually arguing reasonably but rather in dumping as many words into a thread with the intention of shouting down a legitimate idea that is contrary to what you believe would be in your best interests let me predict how your next post will end should you chose to make ityou are a child you type in green this isnt caodgrow up
christ you are a wordy bastardthere is nothing really wrong with the jbs and as far as blues using themwhy not so one alliance leader says to another alliance leader hey your cool want to use my bridgeand the other alliance headcheese says sure youre cool too and you can use my bridge too big guy and from there you have friendship this friendship also es off everyone that can not make friendsthe endmoral of the story quit ing others off and you too can use your buddies bridge
wrong look bittergreen dude the jump bridge mechanic is working as intended dont you understand that you cant stop friends from being friends if you dont like the nc northern coalition then that is fine but you should not make attempts to get ccp to help you win here is a crazy conceptif you dont like being curb stomped all over the place then maybe you should be less bitter and make some friends then with those new friends you might have a chancepro tip friends dont let friends type green
this game isnt about winning and losing for me its about having fun i am not your typical coalition type that without a thought will block the two together winning and fun that is
yes the game is about fun and nothing says fun like taking an hour to go gate to gate in order to go hunting or spending two hours round trip travel in order to spend an hour and a half in combatwhy itd be even more fun if every single ship had ita warp speed reduced to a pods
a lot of the fun that pvp oriented players in nullsec space derive from the game comes from roaming around trying to get fights out of tackling ratters this fun gets diminished in a sad way by the fact that you encounter so many bots during your roams and you get confronted with the fact that people are making boat loads of isk in a way that is still considered cheating rightone prime example is red alliance a russian language alliance even when you roam their space during times that russians should be fast asleep you will encounter 2 or 3 tengus in every system that all warp safe at exactly the same time the second you jump into localthis kind of cheating makes the game less fun and imbalanced and in some regions of space is so wide spread that it in my opinion warrants action by ccp the players that actually play by the rules need your help ccp
this is likely to be locked if youre calling names out the issue heremacro ratting and mining is still a big problem its not news to us and i doubt anyone with any influence with ccp besides the csm who also know this is still an issueclearly the solution is to turn dull activities like mining and ratting into more active ones such as increasing your damage or mining amount based on amount of completed captchas per minute etc
this is the cancer that is killing eve the growing amount of rmt traders in highlow and 00 is crazywhat about having unholy rage more than just once pr exercisei find it hard to believe that this is not difficult to track  players who are logged in for 237 simply cannot be controlled by 1 individual  this alone proves that there is atleast account sharing taking place1kro
or u can move on with your subscription and actually get a fight from ppl that r also trying to get fights unless ure even more riskaverse than those ratters in that case u could just propose to funnel every pve player to u to shoot fish in a barrel with and be immune to everyone else
honestly some roams bring a few small ships and fight ratters often a reasonably fair fight ships go boom on both sides many roams are larger ahac gangs drake gangs nano gangs they shoot ratters to provoke a response the fun is when the defense fleet shows up and you get a fight ratters are generally not very fun to kill unless they are a ratting carrier or dread those are funback to the op the problem with killing macro ratters is you really dont get any response out of killing them when you catch them because there is no player screaming in alliancecorp neutred gang in  just lost my ratting raven so no one comes running and there is no fight and thus no funkill the macros
i am impressed at the massive amounts of proof in this thread for the accusations youve made you should forward it to ccp so they can get on top of it
so thats why the gankers only go after the ratters instead of the defense fleet itself or its hq system am i right so when the defense fleet shows up the gankers advance in another direction to a safe location to fight the good fight of who gets bored first hahaha ure funny
i think this is a real problem i dont have any basis for singling out red or anyone else but its pretty obvious that largescale macro ratting occurspeople who suggest that we gank the ratters dont understand how the macros are programmed as soon as you enter local the macros safe up ive gone on several hour 345 region roams that get no action at all because were just blowing through crowds of macroratters
just make eve check the computer for running macro programs etc if one is detected eve closes itself and maybe sents a mesage to ccp for further investigation as far as i know thats the only way except some stupid captcha or radical ui changes
depends on the response if you come with 30 hoping to pick a fight and 100 show up in a defense fleet usually takes forever youre already dealing with a bunch of people who want to turn around and head home add to it a fight that they know they cant win and it shouldnt be a surprise they leave a more common situation is when two fleets play gate games with each other neither fleet catching the other in a situation they are willing to engage in do this for long enough and someone has to go home since the defense fleet is already home it is the roam that has to leave the areausually in roams ive been on we engage suicidal or otherwise
in other words thats why u came with 30 to gank one ratter because u know u can win as long as u dont bring any less right cause we all know u didnt come with 30 to look for a fight cause thats not enough to attack a system heres an ideadont bring so many so u wont have to wait forever for a fight its still enough to gank the solo ratters and ull get a lot more fights because the other side wont face the same problem u would if your 30 came across the 100man fleet ull just have to face a little risk from the lone ratter who might destroy your precious killboard with one loss this time due to your lower total dps cause thats the only time ull ever engage
back on topicmacro ratting is most definitely a problem that needs to be addressed ive even afk cloaked in a system where i found a neut macro ratter but he just moved oncheating sucks kills the economy excessive isk source and is a source of frustration to legitimate players and subscription payersthis issue keeps coming up because it keeps being a problem whatever is done data mining could be a good start some sort of crackdown is neededsupporting more action against macro use
get a wing of rooks or falcons then problem solved
no not just me its right bacause it so
ah but somewhere you may have in someones opinion fit a ship wrong also your text is very obviously not greentherefore you are wrong
fit a ship wrong even if so its doesnt mean anything here  but definitely im never discuss fittings on forums which is good because if i do its will be a sign that i irrationally wasting time 
dude logitics are good ships and there are ways to defeat a fleet made up of logis you have ecm neuts etca properly fitted curse can drain a logi with one blow from 75k away also a logi fleet is only as good as its weakest link the less properly skilled logi pilot if you break the chain you break the logi fleet i understand your point really i do my antilogi fleet would beforce reconsbc
strictly speaking you just need to stop trolling because youre awful at it failing that you need to stop waving your epeen around like you made a point and especially stop crap posting like you thought that this was caod you might want to learn a bit about the game so while youre flailing yourself in the face with your own epeen you dont look quite so sillyand while you dont have to adapt or die it would be awfully nice if youd at least stop whining not that your whole i am awful and cannot adapt and the reason everybody else can adapt is because they are so much worse than me if they were as good or even better than me they would be as helpless as i am if not more so it is only because i have a hefty swinging epeen that i am powerless and need ccp to save me lol you must really suck if you dont need ccp to protect you  isnt funnyps also you are right posting entirely in lime green really does make your argument stylish and sophisticated people respect folks who are unable to write with text that isnt just so gosh darn pretty
so your saying to survive in this game i need to be more like youas in i need to steal flavour of the month setups from pl use them poorly blob the  out of anything that moves then say its ok if this game is boring as long as i know how to win itbtw im willing to talk to anyone about these things on my ts3 server if you want to have a more detailed chat about these thingsi of course expect you to take the vuk lau approach to this invitation theres no way you can lose an argument you dont have right
my perhaps you mean youre as in you are and not a possessive like youri guess that what with typing in all green making sure you can wrote on an 8th grade level is a bit muchalso seriously stop trollng stop smmqcking yourself in the face with your epeen not only do you keep confusing the forum with caod but your ignorant rage is silly rzr was using armor hac gangs about a year and a half before pl not that that bit of your trollng matters either and no just stop whining and trolling people on the forums and asking ccp to save you and adapt so that you can counter logi heavy gangsps a very good way to spot a third rate whine is when someone starts complaning that a larger group of players are a blob bonus points for your troll about blogging right next to your own refutation as you babble about ahax gangs which routinely fight outnumbered 2 or 31 you cant even make up your mind what youre trollng about the lack of mid sized gangs or the fact that people are using mid sized gangs but you can not adapt so ccp has to rescue you
this is a really bad idea logistics arent an iwin button by any stretch of the imagination not having them at all is usually an easy way to lose fights there is an upward limit where having more logistics in a fleet no longer provides a benefit in any event additionally there are already many different strategies in the game to foil a fleet with logistics support not being able to win because the other fleet has logistics is possibly the worst copout an fc can use right now
one does not simply abreviate logistics to logi dear lord the 8th grade teachers might complain also you might want to check your i button because you wrote trollng something like 3 times as well as complaning writewrote wasis to name a few errors in your syntax i guess learning tense comes after 8th grade from whatever country you are fromfurthermore thanks for the we are really good we fight outnumbered line i was hoping you would pull thati have seen first hand how bad you guys are and that is exactly my point an ape can pull off what you are doing i not only know this because of fighting you and people like you but i use logis far more than you canhave and have had much better results i am warning you that the path we are going down is going to lead to a very boring eve and pretty soon if you want to complain that all this is is that i want ccp to save me from something i usedo and know to be easy then continue but dont delude yourself into believing for a second that you arnt just trying to mask the fact that you wont be able to adapt to another change because god help us this game might actually require more skill and thought to perform well inps shameless plug
no the abbreviation for logistics ships is logi and typical trolling on your part you can type in all green but you have a 7th grade vocabulary so attack typos someone makes with an iphone of course the rest of your post is just more trolling plus some hillarious lying caught in your lie that rzr lifted ahax from pl you just try to move on with more caod crap posting while lying and claiming that anybody said anything about being really good i was simply pointing out that your trolling sucks and you want to troll people for having large gangs and also for not having large gangsnot that your babbling about how you can see the future and its hoooooooorible coupled with more caod style smacking yourself in the face with your epeen isnt hillarious
link me to the first razor ahaxxxxxxx gangps i only ever get involved in baby spelling arguments once someone else brings them up and in the same post has several spelling  tense mistakes ok the spelling i can say whatever its an iphone but saying was instead of is is probably not an issue with your iphonepss do you agree to come on tsvent and have a chat about this seeing as how this is all an elaborate troll
more ignorance not knowing basic 8th vocab is not the same thing as a typo not that im surprised mind people who have to write with pretty colors aret doing so because their text is great on its own of course its telling that knowing basic vocabulary that a 15 year old should know is for babies but its still too advanced green text though that youve mastered and ah well my iphone doesnt exactly have huge buttons and i is next to o of course you still cant use an 8th grade vocabularyand nice bit of trollling you make shut up about rzr lifting a gang concept from pl and when caught in your lie you then try to get me to look through our billboard for some engagements where we lost enough ships that you can see gang fittingscomposition as trolling goes i give it a 510good try though
the ottry in this thread is astoundingflame wars aside wanting logi blanket nerfed because they are fotm is a bit dumbso some small 133t alliance thinks up something good uses it enough that folks notice and start using it and then suddenly its op because the less 133t alliances happen to have more numbersand yeah logi chains are hard to properly break unless they are inexperienced so whatstart looking into avenues to counter logitrainsor hell nerf the guardianbasi cap chains bring their repping capabilities in line with the other twonon the less minigins nerfs essentially make a hella long skill pointless but required for carriers thats fail whichever way you fudge it
my proposal is very simplewhen you open the star map i would like it to be centered on your current location
issue currently there is zero gameplay planned for incarna there is some talk of minigames like gambling or barpub games or what have you but nothing concretesolution integrate the game foldit into incarna foldit makes a game of challenging the users to come up with the optimal configuration of molecules for a given protein its got bright colors spatial manipulation and playing requires no knowledge of chemistry or molecular biology read more at their sitethere are a number of ways the game could be integrated as a lp store minigame a replacement for the daily research agent mission courier or trit some kind of mechanism for the completed protein folds to turn into collectibles or isk payment for solving or some sort of competitive game that people could play against eachother for isk just off the top of my headpros harnass users brainpower for good helping to develop cures for hivaids alzheimers etccould do a lot more than a few thousand bucks for pakistanfuturistic and sciencey fits into the gamewould get awesome pr and mainstream media coverageconsprobably pretty complicated to implement and ccp seems pretty uninterested in making significant gameplay improvements until theyre selling copies of wod and dust
that would be great looks pretty fun and it would benefit the real world too
as im against the neural remaps for plex idea here is a counter proposallet us buy neural remaps for isk this would become a much needed isk sink in game as ccp yet again stated that it is too much isk floating around in game at the momentso how would this workyou buy the remap from the nearest station with a clone service the price is 500m isk each further remap will increase by 500m isk in cost so if you become a remapaholic you will have to pay 4b isk for the eight remap and so onthe free once a year remap should be removed instead you will get a 500m isk reduction in price for the following remap on your characters birthday this way if you only do one remap per year like today you will get them free of charge and remapaholics wont get a free remapnew characters will still have their first two free remaps on year one as beforebenefitsisk sink as the plex solution doesnt actually remove any isk from gamepeople who really want to become remapaholics can do it but at a great ingame costplex will still only be associated with game timedrawbackspeople who are poor at making isk will not be able to benefit from thispeople that are good at making isk will get a benefit however they will still not train faster than anyone that already is on a year long minmax skill plan all they will benefit is to mix and match skills a bit more freely
arleady mentioned tousands of times last montsno drawbacks says is all its about to be a thinking game this includes some planing yearbyyear planing is enough simple already is someone cannot see that far  thats their problem its same in all other things  if you dont have a pland and goal  then its logigal that you going nowhere or someone else have a plan for youthe only benefit from that is some small specific skill groups like drones leadership t2 ships but its not covers a drawbacksthere is some better ways for isk sink
i agree planning helps but as has been mentioned in the other threads people are going on about how they will remap for every skill and for those this would be a very expensive for a remapaholic that do say 8 remaps per year as they bounce between skill groupsremap number  cost1  500m2  1b3  15b4  2b5  25b6  3b7  35b8  4bto be honest if someone wants to do that i have no problem with that now lets say the person keep on going at the same rate for another year9  4b10  45b11  5b12  55b13  6b14  65b15  7b16  75bwell at this stage i cant see anyone keep on trucking and if they do hooray we have the best isk sink ever
well if thiss will grow so progressively its can be interesting
maybe with an exponential growth of the price instead of a linear one
this idea is already being testing on sisi but not for isk for plexs as far as i know in the next patch they will introduce so that you can either put a plex in for 30 days or a remap
if people had to pay an exponentially higher rate for neural remaps on demand i wouldnt have a problem this would be far better than the system ccp came up withthe fear i have with neural remaps is that it brings rl financial disparity into eve i and others who arent going to be hard up for an extra 15 every time we switch a long skill will do that but it isnt fair for players in generalthere are already enough i cant compete because in this game to dissuade new players from sticking around mashies idea will remove that fear
like the idea but the first remap should start lower like 200mil then 400mil then 800mil ecti dont see the issue with remaps as it wouldnt reduce the training time by a massive amount its not like someone could train all skills in 3 years as apposed to the current 20i believe the first remap should be much cheaper then the other ones for noobs sake
well thought out and a much needed isk sink for the richplex for remaps is a bad idea i can get on board with this though
ccp made the tournaments more expensive than they needed to be by flying everyone to iceland so they can have postpre fight talks honestly just like in any sport postpre gamefight is mostly filler could we watch the fights utilizing commentators who arent in the studio yescould we watch the fights and only have devs who already are in iceland chatting about what happened yeswould people rather hear the opinions of the devs than the opinions of a select group of players during prepost fight i wouldi am actually in support of a minigin proposal
they can only siegetriage for so long most caps only carry 23 cycles dreads can push up close to seven cycles if they go really light on jump fuel besides neuting them only allows you to drain their cap faster than it already would be drained it isnt like they are cap stable repping in triagesiegeneuts are vital when shooting a super cap but thats due to the fear that they will log off if given too much time siegetriage locks them in place it only benefits them if they are actively managing their modules so your only rush is trying to kill them before the fight gets bigger i like fights getting bigger kill the neuts let more fights develop
so your only rush is trying to kill them before the fight gets bigger i like fights getting bigger kill the neuts let more fights developthis idea will only work in 00 in low sec there are alot of corp that dont have the ability to make the fight develop not every corp has 7 nyxs or 40 bs capable pilots
may i recommend the last 2 rooks and kings videos for killing caps without other cap blobsneuts are a pretty essential part of thatand you dont want to have to hold down a cap a dread for 3040minutes just to make it run out of stront so it cant siege again in that time help might have arrived from 2030jumps away or more if the help comes in form of caps
cap wont last cap really doesnt last a single siege cycle if you are really using it to rep neuts make a difference of a few minutes when killing a cap with a small force they make no difference when killing it with a large force
original topic here
1 dont cross post2 your topic had overwhelming support in features  ideas that it was definitely worth pushing it to the assembly hall3 if you had even taken the time to review the first 23 pages of the assembly hall you would have found assembly hall  proposal deployable module outpost demolition device
i understand that maybe this space for rent was meant as a joke pun but this brings an ideawhy not let players rent adtime for their corporations on the billboards with a message which scrolls where the bounty info usually isit could be a subscription sort of thing you could pay a certainr ate per day showing or week showing or something like thatthis is a very good idea for one very good reasonno more damn corpcans
this wont work because ccp cant find the section of code governing billboard behavior anymoreor at least that was why they couldnt change it in the past
thats kind of irresponsible and lulzy
i think i can find it remove all of the billboards from the game and watch where the errors come from
yeah an end to the lies
this would certainly be a nice additionlax
oh man you guys have no clue i was just at ccps head office and they have this super dramiel i think its called a machariet yes with a t anyway it has the same play style as the dramiel but with double the shields structure and damage bonus and you can only get it by directly converting plex into it it is so uberdo not get me started on the vindicator mk ii carrierlevel level tank with no mods double the web range and a bigger damage bonus omfg it has effectively 16 guns and trades for 3 plex
and besides this being a troll your proposal as in the reason you decided to post this in the assembly hall like a  isreported for being a moron a troll and incapable of finding your own ass with both hands
010didnt believe it for a second those are likely gm ships anyway a vindicator sells for about 4 plex just the ship so if i can get one that does double damage for less the price more likely you are in your moms basement chuckling to yourself because of how clever you think you are
it was previously sujested that eve needs a pizza timeri propose that a general timer facility be added to the accessories tab on the uia small feature that would just be convienitent fom time to timeall it needs is 3 buttons 1 min 10min and start and then a count down maybe in the same area as the agro timer put it in bright pink or sumthing
no i dont like pizza and such its also so bad for healthinbefore smoke is too selfdistructing 
supported a timer would be handy for checking on things in rl without having to stand up and set a real timer come on i am lazy
yeah your jag goes 4000 ms with how many overdrives eh chumwhy shouldnt the ishkur get a bonus to drone damage huh the ishtar doesthe wolf is a devasting gunboat and so is the munnin but out of the two the munnin gets four bonuses and a tracking bonus to boot give the wolf a tracking bonusquit crying i gave ideas for the assault ships that i can fly i dont know much about the other assault ships so stfuobsidian hawk there is a topic about giving assault ships a fourth bonus but i did not see any topic about which particular bonus to give oooopsosorry
jaguar already hits 4kms with only 1 nanofiber add lg snakes and a loki and your at 63kms ops increase is roughly 20 did it in my head so might be slightly off so that would put jags topping out about 75kms if my math is rightand as op was already told in the other boost af thread a damage bonus to the ishkur would let it pump out 350dps thats a bit over the top in terms of balance
jaguar hits just under 3000 ms with one nano and a mwd and a damage boost letting the ishkur do 350 dps isnt that overpowered tbh
o csmgreat job so far liking the align bookmark thingyhas an align fleet option been suggested yet 
1and align to fleet member too to his location on a moment of align command at least
yes it has been suggested before it was a bad idea and it still isadd an option jump fleet and you dont even have to be behind your computer when your fleet is travelling and why not also add fleet lock option for the fc to let entire fleet lock a target when busy lets just make it an rts
fleet warfare is boring anyway so why do we need to sit and press f1f2 while house md is far more interesitng for example 
i thought the idea was good it may have been misinterpreted as an fc being able to align everybody in fleet rather than allowing the fleet to be able to align to a fleet member and the fc being able to broadcast who to align too
pretty sure you can already broadcast align to
awesome belong on the first page anymore commentssuggestions before it is implemented
seeing as it has gotten no support from anyone besides yourselfits not getting implemented
so basically it is a matar ship which requires caldari cruiser skill hmm i dont see anything wrong with thatif it is op then the whole matar race would be nerfed too poor matar qqers would overflow the forum be rdy for it naband if you want to reduce something start with your forum access thx
hithis was something that was changed over a year ago and i believe it affects both normal and fw missionsi fully appreciate that if the mission objective belongs to someone other than the mission owner you open yourself to be griefed or held to ransom over the objective i am happy for the objective to remain the property of the mission ownermy post more relates to the wrecks albeit in some missions the objective is dropped or help in a wreck in my mind it does not sit right and as such i have suggested that this be reversed and whoever kills the npc takes ownership of it  simplerunning missions is not safe and nor should it be you are open to invasion ninja salvagers and in some cases being ganked i do not feel this change would adversely effect mission runnerskro
you realize that your second to last sentence covers mission running not being safe and that assigning ownership of wrecks to the player that kills it just makes griefing easier and more safe why should they have an easier time of griefing a mission runner why should the ninja griefer and even ganker always be safe griefing is safe and doesnt need to be boosted for scared players who cant take the heat that a mission runner in their pve ship might fight back if they stole loot from the mission runner through taking the loot from a wreck the mr destroyed or one they might actually destroy themselves
could go well within ccps plan for microtr oh wait i didnt say the word would be nice supportedand maybe they would change their means for implementing logos should the need arise
if you see how many fairly old alliances are without logos in game do you really think adding another kind of logo to the to be reviewed queue is going to be a good thing
you see this is actually a good idea however the current process for reviewing logos is just not going to work any moreinstead of reviewing every logo submission cant it be the other way around review a logo if theres enough complaints about it this way ccp doesnt have an omgwtfbbq huge queue and this would actually be viablexeross
this is a good idea it would be better if the stock market system was better fleshed out in eve
every patch they have released has either ignored something or made something worse as far as the ui is concerned6 patches in now 6 thats insane its like we are becoming grandiose beta testerssorry but im not getting paid enough to test things that breakthe copout thread they created to claim what they are up to is too obviousi propose the csm begsasksqueires ccp on who the hell is running their so called dev department and force them to reneg on all patches prior to the first optional patch and then test them throughly on singularity before releasing them to the wildthis isnt bloody micrsoft we are not interested in patching the patch that was patched that is being repatched in the name of some invisible thing that we cant see but claims to run betteryes i know that the game has some issues and yes i know they are doing grand things supposedly but for crying out loudprior to this crap it was workingyeahit may have been slow but it worked now iwe cant link in eve mails note pad is like a damn mine field overview continues to screw up in doublingtripling entriesclient crashesetcim hearing the same complaints from all over my allianceand only a very select few arent reporting issuesand when i say few maybe 1 in 10 pilots thats sadnow i already know this proposal is doomed from the start but i know im not alone in this when i say something has to be saidand something needs to be doneim deathly afraid of incursion whats next mouse clicks being off by 1
i believe the term you are stumbling around for is expansion
patches are fine and so far mostly brought the game forwardthey rewrote the entire technical background behind the ui so they can overhaul it which is important by now if you look at that ugly thing read the devblog concerning that it is necessary and we will profit greatly from it if you are to daft or unwilling to understand what they explained in the devblog thats not ccps problem their information policy to this topic is alrighti for one dont know one single player that had problems so far except in the beginning when some window sizes went bonkers  not a big deal
why all the anger you are ed off all of the time dude chill eat some fiber rub one out come back and try again
eve music is nice and all and it certainly brings the expansiveness of eve together but i think it would be a nice little addition if we could route our own music files through the in game juke box so if we are roaming and need a song to pump us up but dont want to minimize eve to use itunes we can just use the juke box
as my in game jukebox currently contains dethklok and alestorm id say you already can
you can how teach me this devil magic
playlists button
i am surprised that no one else finds this annoying kro
imo just make them unable to lock subcaps this will force them to travel with support instead of just lolhotdroppingactually mazz posted a bunch of changes earlier that sounded pretty reasonable  lower their ehp no locking subcaps scs cant rr so you dont get a lolspidertank what ever happened to those
bump
hey guys rememebr to hit the check here if you want to give suuport to the ideadiscussion going on box if you approveand yes traveling from the most remote systems to jita and back in 5 minutes is bad game mechanics people are screaming dont make eve smaller by shooting down all those supergate threads but the never say lets make is biggerback to jita importing aeverything from and exporting everything to jita makes no sence if your living in the farthest nul sec systems it should be a challenge to live out there without the jita access we have come accustomed toedit after my makes sure you hit the thumbs up button thing i forgot to hit the thumbs up button
i agree with most of the stuff here butwarp speed up needs to go because right now i see my ship rarely going full speed before i arrive with that combat ships should all get their warp speed lowered by quite a bit except those that are meant to be fast interceptors mostlytransport ships should stay the way they are because they obliviously have more room to fit big warp cores rather than combat ships that need to have all sorts of generators big armor plates etc i also would like to see bigger warp ranges overall and more systems that to an extend that it would be crazy to trade between amarr and jita as single person that way we would see more smaller markets along the road having empires divided by lowsec is a great thing imho
i have always thought that the fourth bonus should help make the af assault frigate a heavy tackler and not be ruined by warp scramblers that turn off their mwd mircowarp drive because when that happens they are dead in the water and instapopped so in doing so i propose the following75 to afterburner speed per frigate levelthis would help the af keep his transversal up while tackling larger targets and also with shooting them this would also help out with the speed missions where you cant take a mwd and it works better with an ab afterburner
this bonus of your is not new they put it on the test server before apocrypha went live and it worked too well in factturns out that certain frigates could be tinkered with to fit cruiser sized afterburners and go at slow mwd speeds without the signature penalty that a mwd gives sure using such abs made a frigate turn like a barn but for some frigates namely the ishkur this was not an issue as most of its dps could be applied remotely ie they orbited at 20km and used dronesmuch qqing occurred and ccp backed off from adding the ab bonus to assailt frigsedit grammar fail
if they just nerfed lag there wouldnt be nearly as many problems with drakes ya know
where do you guys stand vis a vis ccp on balance issues seems to me there are a lot of them and that theyd be very easy to implement immediately and adjust as soon as neededwanted people have written up detailed recs on topics like field commands afs eafs increasing logis warp speed tweaking the onieros to be less worthless etcwhen are these going to make their way onto the todo list just change some db numbers see what happens if its imbalanced tweak them
you could save some time though step one find a nice green lime step two cut it open and verify that its juicy step three jam it right into your eyeballs
if you have any balance issues going through it would be nice if you mention the omen
i have seen ccp slipping down this slope for a long time and i think this is the straw that broke the camels back although i dont have as much leverage as you do as a former csm delegate i will join you on this protestas of midnovember this account will go inactive any possessions will remain with the characters if and when i should happen to return ie if ccp regains some senseit seems like hitting ccp in their only notable metric their income is the best way to accomplish this task while i may not have agreed with you on everything you have posted i respect you for sticking to your ethics and wish you the best
now that the reports are out and no the read is not insanely long i have to call bs on one issue they said they stated during the incarna discussions that stations have no windows bulli figured id post this because they said they want to hear players call them on a bad play this is one and while i can understand the technical difficulties of no windows in stations this is a pitiful avoidance of the issue at hand
very interesting video on youtube of markee dragon shattered crystal fame interviewing jared psigoda a kingpin in rmt consulting chinese gold farming
from 2230 he talks specifically about eve online and plexhe even says he thinks ccp is smart in how they are attacking rmt keep it up ccp a little sauce in account security department will be nails in the eve rmt coffin pound them in
i wonder what would happen if min could stop trolling in a post long enough to convincingly complain about how unfair it was that he was being accused of trolling that or if he didnt feel driven and compelled to post with colored text to show just how serious his argument should be taken
i fail to see what your point is by saying all im doing is trolling whether it is or not being unable to answer convinsingly is a bad signworse yet is that you are happy to spend time giving excuses to why you wont answer the questions i put forward it would be far more convinsing and reasonable to just answer them this is assuming that you can without sounding even more ridiculousof course by nature if you were smart enough to figure this out you also probably wouldnt be in the nc but there lies the very reason this argument is still going
you confuse the spending of individuals with the spending of alliances and as bff as everyone in the nc are they dont share money with each other my understanding is that the majority of the supercaps in the game are purchased by individuals or a couple of individuals contribute then share the supercap yeah yeah eula violation i have an empire alt that i use to carebear i think a lot of 00 people do sure the anoms have brought more people back to 00 for their isk farming needs but they are also bitterly fought over as there rarely are enough to go around besides that again we are talking about personal income not alliance income alliances cannot tax their members other than to require member corps to pay in dues to balance the books at the end of each month which is common practiceif you can show me how an alliance can set an alliance level tax i think many alliance leaders would love you this is sarcasm as only corps can tax players ratting bounties bounties arent the source of income in 00 for players by the way if they were people would be better off running lvl 4s in high sec by a long shot you get lp and guaranteed things to kill most bounties are in empire go to motsu or amarr or any number of mission running hubs hundreds of mission runners grinding in each all the time the biggest alliances only have a couple hundred to a thousand people online at any given time and most arent ratting
like i said trolling while whining that youre called out for trolling is hilarious of course youre also lying as absolutely everything has been addressed and discussed and of course as a troll im sure that you would really like it if you could get people to dance to your tune instead of pointing out how full of crap you areoh and caod is a different forum save your crap posting for there eh
that you have called me out for trolling on every single post you have made in reply to me here and in assembly hall yet continue replying alerts me to 3 possibilities 1 for your sake hope you are trolling2 you have no idea what trolling is3 you think i am not trolling and you are threatend by what i am saying and simply want to discredit itfor my purposes it really doesnt matter which is the case you are still an idiot
aaaaaand youre still trolling while whining about being correctly identified as trolling what are the oddsnow your new troll is if im trolling then either you are really the troll or nobody can understand what trolling is or you cant handle the truth oh and u r dumof course i keep pointing out where you say stupid things lie and troll because i find your antics amusing but like a typical troll you want to pretend that you control the conversation and its bait and a you think ever so clever trap so that if people respond and debunk your idiocy you win because they respond and pointed out that youre trolling so youre right or they dont respond and therefore nobody can dare counter your argument so youre right
you are just a troll this is not caod have i debunked you yet
i cant find one right now but there have been a pile of threads on moon mining in whs another one that seems to come up a lot

i support this topic because i want more tears to flow carebear tears are easy to harvest and hard to sell due to aflooded market xd ninja tears are almost as easy to harvest and sell to mission runners ganker tears are the sweetest of all though and universally purchased by hauling alts everywhere for a considerable profit id rather support galvatines option due to the failings of the current bounty system not that i think galvatines option doesnt contain flaws which are pointed out in the relevant thread id rather see larger scale conflicts in highsec that make it as dangerous for gankersninjas to operate with impunity due to player interaction not concord interaction this is relevant because every gankerninja i know or speak to does it to encourage carebears to pvp never have i heard a gankerninja say something like i do this because i have a small  irlmy mommy told me i have to move out her basementi get bullied at school and this makes me feel bettermy gf stomps on my  while wearing high heels and this just makes me feel better honestly if you do feel this way do it right go down to your local police recruitment center like all the other bullied kids i knew in high school and learn to harass people irl for fun and rl profit this will get the pvp that gankersninjas profess to desire in high sec going rather than joining fw or rvb exciting things like dodging fleets of bounty hunters who used to be former corp mates with an ax to grind or a blob of noobs trying to earn enough to buy first battleship actually i think that maybe any corp that has over a certain amount of ganks in high sec should have a bounty placed on all members to make it truly pvp worthy kind of like a wardec i do tend to think that maybe the gankersninjas all 3 a mostly risk free method of producing income sounds kinda carebearish to me sorry sec status is too easy if excessively boring to increase for losses to be a significant penalty if i have my hauler alt for when my sec status gets too low so should you as many of you have been at it for far too long to not have made oneor is the real reason ganking is so widespread is because there are few consequences for doing so and laughter all around for the gankersninjas keep in mind ive ganked and made a profit after having been ganked and lost quite a bet of my isk which tbh wasnt a lot in eve terms and have no real issue with it either way it just gives me the giggles when a ninja or ganker needs to feed his starving wife and 75 kids and complains when heshe fails to gankninja you seriouslygonna have to make a recording of a corp m8 qqing after failing a gank thats why im using this name to post i dont want him to know its coming xdor maybe let the flood of tears be releasedplease sec status loss should be directly related to the isk value of goods dropped by the target you get that one big score and then have to hide out for a long time kinda like robbing and bank and heading to russia xd let sec status go to 50ish total perhaps 10 doesnt seem enough for a profit of 1 bil on a gank this will repopulate low sec and make teh pew pew all around i hope you dont mind if i spam come through my gaaate and youll be podded soon when you try to come to my corps claimed territory see all easy solutions for teh creation of pew pew flame onps for the record i do it because people hurt my feelings at school xd and it makes me feel better to taste the tears of other peopleedited out a  where it shouldnt have been
cosmetic onlyif i didnt pay for eve by using plex then id vote nobut im not actually paying ccp directly so in this case i do believe they should have an alternative way to gain income
no
no

no this would be bad
have i voted yet i thought i had but cant find my vote in any casenoone could make an argument for cosmetic only and how it wouldnt affect the game but i honestly dont think it would stop there no matter how good the intentions were in the beginning i also disagree with plex   isk  items but i recognize the arguments for it it should end with that

no if they start with microtransactions they might as well sell their company to ea or soe itll be all downhill from there
no 
nooooooooooooooooofirst off this wont benefit eve at all we all know where the extra cash will go strait to dust which is fail btw honestly what is the life expectancy of a fps let alone a niche fps further as tyranis has shown painfully is ccp needs to fix their game before adding moar stuff if you really wanna keep the game fresh work on polish and changing the current environment similar to the sansha incursioni want to play eve where my will and intelligence is what propels me to success not some space based version of second life or game where even though im a loyal paying subscriber im at a disadvantage to some rich brat with extra paid features i cant justify buying rant over im too young to be a bitter vet

since i know how close the fights against good fitted and flown geddon are if you start at 20km or less chances are pretty good i never engaged one at 45km meganb 3mfs 22 capsgedonmp 3hs 323 caps103abaddonmp 2hs 52 caps30a single mwd cycle takes 540 cap and you need 34 to cover the common 2420km distance to a target in a megatime to break even 2m 40s to the gedon54s to the abaddonthis is only 3 bursts and assuming you only got 1 target in most fights you will have more than just 1 target and you will need the mwd a lot more than just for 3 cycles to get and stay in range so the cap use is a lot higher most of the the timebefore you even consider active tanking
oh yea make them big lolif they cant dock which i support then they must be bigger since they are considered super carriers
i vote yes for this proposal the reasons are followingcarebear tears are as sweet cokeninja tears are as sweet as cool aidganker tears are sweet like ghetto aidbut censor tears combined with lawyers tears will send you into a diabetic coma and wed get both with the addition of funtari to eveup with funtari and well get the miners to collect the lawyer and censor tears through tearduct interaction bottle them up cutting them 1 part tears to 1000 parts water and sell them as the sweetest drank on the market the proceeds will be spent to buy plexes for everyoneadditionally it would encourage players to join fw to wipe the gallente from the face of new eden
well make the hull hitpoints huge and give the station nanobots that repair hull slowly so that this has to be done fielding capital shipsalso if this would be possible the station should have slots to put defense batteries in that go in effect when the timer hits 0 and the station becomes destructable shooting ships based on standings bit weird now aint it that in empire all stations have sentry guns but you cant put them around your outposts
excellent idea
a quality idea in assembly hall no wai11
even just a little more cpu would unsuck the omen quite a bit supported
i dont fly the omen now and i probably wont even if it gets buffed but its a clear case of bad fitting gimping an otherwise viable ship for no good reason
i would not say that fmp  1600mm should be possible but fmp  800mm  mwd  around 100 points grid should be possible the spare grid is mostly for the reason that the 1600mm should be possible with a rcu ii similar to the rax also because you will most likely not have maxed fitting skills if you will fly it in the beginningalso it needs a bit more cpu to
it has some crazy fitting issues supported
make it useful please

legioncovertfailwinend
o 10 is a crap use bonus
however that is not the situation here the base damage for lasers is higher than the base damage for the other turret thus a heavy beam fitted legion can deal 924 of the raw damage of a 250mm railgun fitted proteus while the legion has slightly less base damage it has much better tracking 435 therefore in real combat the legion is likely to have better damage output than a rail proteus a artillery loki has worse damage and worse tracking than proteuswith short range fittings the difference in damage output is extreme but then so it the difference in range while the proteus can deal 46 more raw damage than the legion at the proteus otpimal range the legion will deal 90 more damage than the proteus at the legions optimal range damage output from an autocannon loki at the legions optimal range is the same as the legion going in closer gives the loki an advantage moving out further to the legions optimal  12 falloff range and the legion has a 28x damage advantage over the lokithere is nothing ridiculous about the current state of affairs each ship has its strengths and weaknesses put the legion in the proper situation and it will shine put in the wrong situation and it will die this is the way it is for every ship and is the way it should be i see no obvious problem with the current bonusesif you have further arguments in favor of the proposed change please ensure that they take a wholistic view of the ship and its fittings do not compare bonuses out of context
i think the ops point is that each covert ops reconfiguration subsystem is increasing the damage of the weapons of the ship in one way or another where as the legion subsystem does not unless you can show that the legions reconfiguration subsystem does not actually increase dps or show that the other subsystem bonuses are not increasing dps were hardly talking about the base damage or the base tracking of the ships weapons rather the op is pointing out and i agree that if you had four t3 cruisers one of each kind with similar set ups with the covert reconfiguration and the racial offensive subsystem trained to 1 or more the legion would be the least damaging of the fouri support this proposal but not the optimal range increase extra range in theory is nice but remember this ship is a cloaker range in not necessarily useful
my point is that the legion doesnt need a damage bonus it is already built in to the guns damage multipler lasers have a built in bonus to damage along with a built in penalty to cap usage you dont need a damage bonus from the ship to get comparable damage from lasers as you do from other turrets that do have a ship bonus however you do need a cap usage bonus to get lasers cap usage down to a level that is comparable with hybridsif you have the offensive systems skill trained to 5 the other ships have a small advantage for damage that is counter balanced by advantages that the legion has in other areas if you have the offensive systems skill trained to 4 they have approximately equal but the legion retains its other advantages if the offensive systems skill is 3 or less the legion has a damage advantage over the other ships but has a cap usage disadvantagecomparing bonuses out of context does not work you need to look at the attributes that the bonuses are being applied to working as intended

idgi what are people angry about every other modern game out does micro transactions why should we handicap the company that we pay while the competition all get rich over itplus im pretty stoked about being able to remap whenever i want i mean really have you people even looked at the useless reqs on leadership skills do i really want a high charisma for a frickin year no no i dontdont listen to the gays ccp i and many others will spend a great deal of money remapping through plex and damn the ninnys along the way
no plex for remaps no plex for anything except the 30 days of game time it represents
and isk omg
im referring to the destruction of the plex when ccp removes it from the game someone should only get 30 days of game time
not too sure about that    what happens when local is gone  pve becomes more dangerous and ultimately less efficient traversing through such a solar system becomes more dangerous small gang warfare becomes more dynamicattempting to turn this proposed game mechanic into a greifing system   1 to aggressively deny your enemy local would hurt most notably their ability to generate isk2 to make your actions affect the enemy significantly you would aim for their most active systems which would be ihub systems3 the effort needed to destroy the tcu  the ihub  account for the multiple ref timers would be so great of a cost that you simply would have to commit to dismantling the entire alliance and not just weaken them be taking one system from them4 lastly throughout 3 the amount of meaningful combat interaction opportunities further solidifies the importance of this feature and its positive effect on the eve community this is very true it would force null sec inhabitants to decide if local is worth six million isk per day base cost of a claimed system the end result would expand the concept that eve is all about evaluate the risk of every action1 no sov  no local you become less noticeable to other null sec entities however you pve with greater risk2 maintain sov  local in systemyour space is now more visible however you gain the security that the local feature provides how is change a downside   lets say a megaalliance does fold what follows is a power vacuum chaos and ultimately conflict this keeps the game interesting and reinforces the fact that eve is a cold dog eat dog world sorry peta rebuild all that is needed is for someone to reclaim sov  a dt and then presto you have local but more to the point eve is not about sustaining constancy it is about change on a side notemost megaalliances do not maintain 100 sov throughout their territory they have holes between their main station constellations examples it razor drone regions etc this feature would support hit and run tactics in these gaps of sov the fc would for the first time be able to truly obscure his true combat strength when conducting roamsthanks antihrist for the comment though
oh yeah
supported then i would have at least 1 use for evegate too

you have 24 hours to set your queue no reason to put this on evegate and i rather not have a website to have write access in that databasealtough that would make awsome posts if someone hacks the website and can get into the databasenot supported

holy  your dumb
sov definitely needs to get some more work done
yes i forgot how eager you were to watch lagblackscreen and get blueballedsometimes for you to have more fun you have to have less ability to throw 1000 people into any system you want i know this is a concept the nc is not familiar with but in pvp gangs we often have to turn people away because as one of your fcs put it so well today as i was listening in on your coms no one wants to fight us because they dont have enough numbers again i point out your version of fun is exctremely close and i would say confused with winningif this change goes through and travel time increases slightly but everyone gets better fights more often is this not more fun is this not a win for the gamebut i guess if the nc suffers a few systems for the greater good of eve the price is too high to payalso you still seem incapable of providing an explanation for not wanting to chat on ts i would just appreciate an answer it doesnt have to be yes
agree with limegreen buddy i just fail to see what good theyve brought to the game bringing easylazy fleets formups of alliances living 30 jumps from each other aint good in my book dominion and upkeep costs didnt change the situation that much neither the amount of macrobotminedliquidozone required can balance that so yea nerf it already
this whole thread is just dumb having jump bridges for alliance use wont change a damn thing nothing you want the game to become more boring is that it even if somehow it was changed it would not change anything we would still control the north and i guess in doing so still control your game so you will have to run back to ccp and tug on their pants and beg for yet another change in some delusional attempt to get the game to change where you are on tophow about you use the current mechanics to try and win is that so hard we are and are able to do it so its not like its impossible what is your excuse
it only misses the bold font face really 
my point is wasting development time on a change that will do nothing is a waste of time this change will actually do the opposite is that what you want we will just put up even more jump bridges to still be able to travel so again your plan will do nothingyou talk about how we dont want to put forth effort but it is you all who are the ones who dont want to put forth effort so you want ccp to put forth the effort so you dont have to and here i thought you guys wanted a challenge all you want to do is nerf fun thats it
mlyp
kill the macrosccp turns a blind eye on macros since they provide a steady income from their subscriptionsdid i just aggree with northern coalition
data mining would be a start but really all ccp needs to do is a roam arouns stain or other npc regions regularly and im sure theyd come across many people marcoing is it really that hard to moderate their own game that they need to actually wait for someone to petition a problem instead of proactively looking for them
fix the cheaters and fix the lag or i going to pop you all  ccp3 curses mom
1 sure as soon as you make capitals and supercapitals unable to rep each other as well same gimping for everybody 2 could be interesting if scaling back logis to medium rep fittings dont see it happening though those would not be carebear ships per say and thus would get low development priority this could actually work somewhat3 well when were at that i suggest me also remove dictors and hics as well why because we can
it already does that you just have to zoom in
you just contradicted yourself  my proposal is that the map opens centered on your position by default having to zoom in isnt being centered on your position by default
deviantart doesnt suck barrack mate uses it he was very very goo aww what the  its a place for those of us who never think about moving forward ive never heard about more than single good use for deviantart and thats humon google humon comics but beside thatalso when they say deviantart judges do they mean people rejected by artworld im bit confused on the topic on related note what the f does it have to do with internet spaceshipsim happy that what won won i also liked naru very much but damn i should have watched some of the nonsemi artpieces especially that caldari mentioned up there damn
please visit your user settings to reenable imageswhat can i even say alongside this picture i cant be the only one who thought thisof course ccp liked it it was a myrmi with some bits pulled off reversed and a the paint stripped off
ohnoez life is unfair wahwahwah
well my first thought was wtf only one or two of the semi finalists look like eve ships but in the end they dont have toif say the tornado wins all non minmatar pilots will be ed so it needs to be something unique not belonging to one of the major racesmy votes goes therefore to the jove bc looks good fits into the eve universe und is probably totally op
i support this
i hearby petition you ccp and beg please please put the 2nd place winner in the game tooanyone who agrees post here
can someone clarify this for methere was a competion which the winning item a minmatar ship will go in gamewhat does this mean for the other races are they just gonna be one short in the tier system or is ccp gonna make the others sorry havent been following these competitions lol x
moved from general discussion and cleared off topic information
either invent a new class of ship so that the tornado would be the minmatar hull then you need one each for the other races lightcruiser class covops light cruiserretire a hull in use ie the bellicose hull replace with tornadoadopt the gallente dusbuster hull second place winner retire who cares theres plenty of ugly gallente cruiser hulls and replace with the narukami
the 2 place didnt really match gallente this one would do this far betterlinkagei was like hmm till i watched the front image a bit longer and recognized something that remarkable reminds me what makes the brutix look mean it is just a bit to skinny beside this it is perfect
looks nice itd be a nice replacement for the hyperion
sure something engaging in incarna would be niceedited for thumbs up
yup 1
to  buy 50 then 100 as used mosted for t2 building doable and fair entoh said
id choose that over plex for remap but i would still prefer none of those to be added to the game
nice the current isk sinks are pitifulsales tax lolinsurence it brings in more isk than it takes awayship destruction pretty decent if its a massive ship or a plextrel but it doesnt come close to the collective lvl 4 mission runnersnul ratters make
support this in addition to plex for remapthis game needs more ways to be dynamic and make training times approach reasonable
isk for remaps in general is a far better idea than plex for remapsexponential growth instead of linear growth also helps with the rich getting richer argument as paying to power level suddenly gets very expensiveit also takes pressure off of the plex market values so people can still play to pay for their subscriptions without needlessly inflating the cost of a plex
static prices are bad especially as isk sinks as that holds the isk at a certain level just like it is with skill books those you can never sell below their priceoeditthis was written while being very tired somehow it lots its sense now
either version should not be added to the game
this is a terrible idea everyone is complaining that remaps for plex gives an unfair advantage to those with some extra rl cash which is absurd since anyone can buy plex with isk  yet this proposal gives an unfair advantage to those players who are already isk rich at least with plex the price stays fairly even and everyone can use it not just the richnot supported
those who are isk rich can just buy a character with 100mil skill pointseither way if your rich in isk or money wise you have an advantage
getting a remap for isk is the same thing as getting it with plex you can get plex with isk  vice versathe rest of your idea is interesting but its overly complicated
hm what if we combine this idea with plex remapfor example1 2xplex2 4xplex3 8xplexits as another alternative also far more better than original remap idea
sure but at least we have a lesser evil here
lets put a simple wildass assumption in the room same as yours then quoted part from op is utter rubbish 1 worth it is hardly a quantifiable factor at all worth it for ccp financially worth it for your personal epeening worth it because only under the totally artificial tournament rules you feel you can compete take your pick or what 2 i do not enjoy the tournaments i rather think they are a total waste of time if i even recognize them being held that already turns your statement into a blatant lie id rather have ccp spend the resources wasted there on more stable and bugfree gameplay3 considering those resources past tv coverage and what not could be utilized way better than help perhaps 500 players out of the whole playerbase stroke their personal epeens id instead advocate for curbing resources spent on tournaments to the absolute minimum or tldr  nobody cares so actually i tend to go in the complete opposite direction your lack of viable arguments for this proposal made that way easy tbh
this has probably been proposed before but i cant seem to find a relevant postas a seller of blueprint copies bpc i find the current limit of 21 contracts to be inadequatecompare trade rank 1  adds 4 orders per level retail rank 2  adds 8 orders per level wholesale rank 4  adds 16 orders per level tycoon rank 6  adds 32 orders per levelto contracting rank 1  adds 4 contracts per leveli propose adding contracting skills such as fine print rank 2  adds 8 contracts per level contract law rank 4  adds 16 contracts per level legalese rank 6  adds 32 contracts per level

add a fits current ship tick box to hangar and containerswhen the tick box is ticked you only see modules which can fit on your current shiptakes into account your remaining slotsgridcpuwhen you fit a module that takes chargesscripts those chargesscripts then become visiblenano paste visible if you have thermodynamics skillbooster visible if you have the skillz and an appropriate module fitted to take advantage of said booster if neccessary  wont apply to exile third party apps seem to be able to supply some of this functionalitymakes fitting ship easier when you have all your stuff in 1 canhangarclient side only change so no impact on server 
i personally would also need an option where you can select different sized modules as well fitting a battleship with this feature wouldnt really be helped if i couldnt exclude smallmediumxl modules while doing so
id like to see a hulkclass ship with larger drone bay increased drone bandwidth drone damage bonus drones are a miners only defense higher agility increased ehp able to fit gas harvesters possibly at the same time as strips cant change subsystems in wspace maybe 1 strip hardpoint and a 3x yield role bonus so same as hulk oreicegas bay faster wspace asteroids tend to be tens of km apart extra midslot for a scanner capacitor usage reduction on strips longer targeting range allows use of wstabs instead of mluit doesnt have to mine more to be a better  different shipit shouldnt be invulnerable but it should have a survival chance against the dangers of wspace
supported if it can mine gas coulds 
made the obvious more obviousproposaladd a specific petition category to alert ccp of hacked and compromised accountsprosit would be more obvious as to where you petition this issue it is currently a little ambiguousfaster response to your petition and quicker account freezingconsplayers without enough proof may incorrectly petition an account with no problemsothergive this new category the highest priorityadd a warning and repercussions if this petition catagory is abusedthis proposal would allow people other than owner of the account to notify ccp
if your account has been hackedcompromised then its likelly your password will have been changed and you will no longer be able to log into your account to create a petitionother methods such as rl email are more appropriate for this functionality
i updated the post to make it more obviousother people can submit a petition for you or if you have multiple accounts you can use another although these would probably be compromised also also to note is that you cant always guarantee the victim has the right emails or that the time is right for a direct call the times that i have required this function have been when weve corpmates noticed an account being online when the owner is unable to get access in these instances weve had to use the stuck petition which works but isnt the right place combined with emailing securityccpgamescom even still i do not see this as being enough reason not to add ittamber
this is the only part of this i dont likei really dont want other people helping me out in this fashion im quite capable of handling my own account thank you and i really dont need ccp locking my account while they investigate a false alarm
maybe introduce guristas sansha blood raiders and serpentis factions into fw just an idea
not supported it is a good idea but tbh you people are submitting too many proposals settle down and let ccp fix stuff and quit yapping about your stupid ideas
why are you against the angel cartel they sell you some bad stuffmaybe not this but better less ed npcs would be nice and more of a way to interact with the pirate powers then missions that are not in lo sec
oops forgot about them
tch your op is sort of half assed for an assembly hall thread you could ditch it and create a round table discussion about the npc pirate factions in features and ideas or take a good half hour and think up a decent proposal with a plan and detailsassembly hall is more for a finished product to be voted to be passed to the csms i think the base of your idea has some merit it might be interesting to see it reworked and submited when details are clear and the new gameplay defined

1 dont be a smartass  and technically i crosslinked  not crosspostedmy topic had zero comments or responses when i decided to crosslink the post here herewell to be fair i browsed the first 23 pages and the one you mention wasnt there when i posted but hey you want to be a smartass so rock on
may as well put this on the back burner considering the vastly more important stuff that needs to be fixedbut if the devs could find a few minutes to address this problem that would be great warping to acceleration gates at 0 usually warps you into the gates or at least it seems that way after the last expansionmaybe make it warp you in at 500m or 1k so you dont get stuck in the gate but can still hit the activate gate button without floundering around for five minutesanyways tiny gripe just wanted to mention itgoes back to lurking
yes i think its very simple to doas i remember its been quite a pain in the ass when i do missions
good idea and when you land inside them sometimes when youre paying a limited amount of attention you dont just get stuck you get slingshotted off of the gate and have to reapproach also fix warp to zero while your at it i dont mind it but sometimes in a pod and hitting warp to zero on a station you still land 13km away from the docking ring seems pretty stupid
my smartbomb bs supports this
i love this idea even if the only benefit to come from it would be reuniting some lost code with its programmer

very often in eve ill need a mod and find that the closest match is 6 or so jumps away that means 12 jumps to get the mod this kills a lot of time i could be playing the game would be great if we could pay an extra fee to have it delivered so we can get on with pvppve it seems to me that the act of jumping xx amount of jumps doesnt add to the game experience to me its a tedious time waste as far as the specifics im sure it could be limited to xxx amount of m3 per delivery and limited to a xx jump radius it could be limited to lowsec and higher or whatever the cost per delivery could be based off your trade skills this wouldnt get in the way of the gankbears cause the m3 size delivered is limited anyways just a thought
ccp tries to get as much stuff out of the hands of the npc into players hands and for players we already have courier contracts
sure as long as the npc haulers use t1 industrials and the standard autopilot ai warp to 15km slow boat to gate i think that if they put this into effect with those stipulations in place then they should allow the service to move items anywhere in eve for a fee if the npc hauler gets blown up you lose your items thoughi could see a system like this putting people such as red frog out of business personally
i would say the max amount of m3 that you could have delivered would be say 200m3 this isnt intended as a way to move freighterbadger loads 100 jumps across eve i imagine the max range of the deliveries would be a 58 radius from wherever you are so no getting stuff delivered from jita if you are in 00

guys his topic has already been posted please keep all ideas and discussions to the original thread link is in my previous post
opposed ui is badly fed up as it is still no need to provide ccp with more incentive to screw it up for weeksmonths again
yo ppli got a suggestion to make they should make a ship specificly designed for smartbombs as we all know smartbombs are useless except for that very closeorbiting ship in that rare mission or something the only way to get decent results is by a officer smartbomb for like 3bill or something  its just not practical this new ship could get bonuses to range and damage or rof might be a fun little ship to pvp or run that fun mission in but still just a suggestion plz comment if you have other suggestions
why not make a new kind of ship that can use giant smartbombs that kill everything on grid
in all honesty i understood one thing from that giboncrug affair  you can cheat as long as you dont rmt
normally at fanfest the csm offers a qa roundtable but since ccp foots the bill for our attendance maybe there is more that the csm could do to earn its keep and represent the community while thereeither instead of or in addition to the standard qa session perhaps funny skits presentations interviews impromptu surveys of players if you have a good idea share it all reasonable suggestions will be shared in our internal forums where we are brainstorming fanfest ideas right now
firstlap dances in gorilla suits and sumo suits
i think it is critical that ccp fly all the past csm to the next fanfest this would show the players of eve that ccp is uhm committed to making the csm relevant to  uhm eve being best ever and that since the first csm ccp counted on the csm to provide all the ideas the players love in eve and the past csm well stood against all the things in eve that needed standing against  and that having them there shows that even after their terms the past csm continues to stand or sometimes after the pub crawl lean against those terrible stand againsting things having the past csm there also shows ccp clearly hears the voice of the players through the csm about the importances ofuhm well microtransactions oh the humanityand how awesomehorrible the idea of incarna isand well the terrible problem of too manynot enough supercapsand how low sec should be safer and more profitable for carebears while also being awesome for pvp and pirating at the same timeand how 00 sov should be possible for small corps while still retaining everything the larger alliances want as wellthen of course it also provesthat uhm ccp hears you all about the csm needing to be more than just a pr stunt to give some lucky players iceland vacations while they are in the csm flying in the past csm would prove that the csm is not just a stunt to provide some player vacations in iceland for a year its about a pr stunt to give lucky players iceland vacations for life just think how many more folks will run for the csm next electionbesides the past csm would let players take a great csm group photo speak withshout athugkickthrow a spoon atshare a beer withthrow a beer at their favorite past csm learn first hand how low the bar was to be elected to the previous csms have more csm to throw into the volcano to sacrifice to the gods of lag more experienced guides to help you back to your hotel when the devs ditch you drunk and lost at 400 am after the pub crawls have more folks that can tell you if you just ate 2 year old shark or dried rams testies ok maybe folks that swear thats not what you are eating after offering you somein summary having all the past csm there shows ccp has a strong committment to committingas to what the current csm could do at fanfest i vote for a roving beer cart that goes to all the meeting rooms during the dayissler
you are over reacting t this seems silly
it depends on how you look at it we all play eve or any other game because we find it fun and when looking around eve you can easily find scores of different definitions of fun sometimes fun leaves when friends leaves or gameplay changes and sometimes the fun goes away when perspective on a game shifts this is most often seen when something happens in real life with family that is life changing marriage life death etc but sometimes random wakeup calls happen in other waysis reevaluating the time and energy put into a game due to this any different than leaving because you found a new hobby or relationship and your priorities changed
i try to be amusing  and in this case also right
at 2940 he the chinese gold farming kingpin offers to help game companies in stopping account hacking his justification is that it hurts legitimate rmt trade as much as it hurts the game players ccp consider giving this fellow a chat and seeing the perspective from the rmt side possibly even getting some insight on account hacking
no
no
no no no once more no
no
yes sorry guys im not poor
no
no not even for cosmeticstldrdo not give the devil a foothold im not saying micro transactions are evil but giving this a foothold in the ccp mindset will only lead to more and more of it also theres an old saying you can take them out of egypt but you cant take egypt out of the israelites so of course if ccp introduces microtransactions of anykind the playerbase in general is going to revolt eve was built upon 15month to do whatever you want and anything where real life money is involved is going to be a very thorny issue id rather leave microtransactions for another game entirely such as world of darkness dust514 is tapping into eve and if its on a micro transaction model then theres going to be constant division and controversy possibly even a rich kid elite force that makes them very tough not because of skill but because of deep pockets we wage enough daily battles trying to earn a good income i really dont need some rich superupgraded noob to rub that fact in my face every night one of the great things about eve is that everyone starts the same like a chess game its about strategy planning and taking advantage of weaknesses what if during a match we could pay to get our queen back or upgrade the knight with more maneuvers what if our opponent had a parent who didnt want them to spend money to upgrade their chess pieces is the game really fair or balanced end
thumbs up  thumbs down to mts wierdly enough or maybe just for vanity items buff pirates by making it easy for them to know who has the really big wallets to rob
no
noit would ruin the sandbox plexselling is bad enough
notheres too much of this microtransactions crap just about everywhere
rl money for game time only not even for cosmetic items ccp should focus on creating a game that is fun to many people not on melking the cows by creating ingame assets that sell well
no
cosmetic only
no eve was advertised and sold as a subscription game not a rmt game if you change things now you risk alienating your player base and losing money ask sony about swg once you alienate your current player base you are done the game will slowly downsize if ccp needs more money to expand services raise the subscription rate by a dollar its much easier and you dont have to worry about abuses or unfair advantages or players being annoyed by the system which we will be look for other means to raise revenue makesell better than currently available killboardsforums on eve gate charge for api services have a premium website that gives paying members some inside info and insight look outside the game for those revenue streams
yea i dont like the way ccp rushes into new features lots of existing features are in prototypical and unfinished state as op says id like to see some significant effort to improve old features like missions pos managementindustry interfaces or faction warfare

agree with op blasters need some loveas they are meant to be the middle ground between ac and lazorz i wonder why they suffer from both the ac reloading time 10s and the laser lack of choice when it comes to damage typesblastersrails as a middle thing between ac and lasers would make more sense if you had like 5s reload and two different damage type combinations even if it were more thermal vs kinetic
omen badly needs the attention and has for a long time
well i wouldnt mind a sleipnir that can fit both point and web
part 1 can be found herefor those too lazy to go back and read the original post heres how things start outmuch clamoring of carebear paws and honeypots commences csm delegate trebor daehdoow all but gloats sayingas of now this issue is supposedly being presented along with 199 other issues  to ccp for review now id like to open this thread back open for discussion for a few reasonsa i dont think a barely 2 page thread merits this being a closed issueb i find that an elected member of the csm who has a frightening amount of power over this calling a workingasintended game mechanic a sleezy loophole simply because it does not fall in line with their playstyle more than slightly disturbingc most importantly ive just now seen the original thread and its locked and i wants to open my mouthand so without further ado
dear zeriel meholicka scenarioseems a tad ridiculous wouldnt you sayi should not have to tell you that eve is by no means a fair game and im sorry to say that there are and always will be people who have advantages over others in this game what can i say its an imperfect universethe mechanism youre referring to of pilots using an orca to switch ships during battle is a fully oh please dont make me say it working as intended game mechanic there are you happy now from ccps original dev blog on the release of the orca in 2008doesnt look broken does it what youre suggesting isnt a needed game balancer its a solution to your problem i might add that rorquals and carriers both utilize ship maintenance bays that function in the exact same way would these changes effect the mechanisms of all ship maintenance bays or just the ones giving your war targets a leg up on youlooking at it another way is shipswapping out of an orca really any different than a neutral altfriend bringing you a ship and ejecting it from it under current gameplay this does not flag the neutral but why stop with neutral orcas what about neutral stationbumpers or how about flagging scammers as red to the corporation of the individual they just ripped off whats next flagging people for salvaging wrecks i couldnt help myselfthe guys with the neutral orcas arent cheating they arent exploiting an oversight utilizing hacks or using the negative multipliers of a wormhole to create infinite tracking on turrets   what theyre doing is outgunning you believe me the people who use them spent a considerable amount of real time or real isk to have them and theres a reason for thatso what youre really talking about here isnt a broken game mechanic its called escalation when null fleets started using areaofeffect doomsdays they countered with rangedictating sniper bs fleets those were countered by logisticsheavy armor hac fleets and sooner or later someone smart will probably figure out a way to counter that these are the ways things work soas for your problems with war targets using neutral orcas i propose another solution get your own neutral orcaso7aiden mournceo suddenly ninjas tears alliance
when in doubt click start new thread
uh ok yeah surecool story brooo not sure how to respond to this
i dunno maybe some novel outoftheblue thing like i agree and or disagree and here are my reasonsi dont think the argument here is or even should be whether its okay to use an orca to rapidly switch ships midcombat the argument is whether it makes sense for you to be fighting someone who uses an orca in that manner shooting the orca and getting concorddokened
should we set stations to be blinky red when your war target docks with them to get a different shipshould we remove the 30 second session timer from switching ships in stationshould we add 30 second session timer to pods when you are ejected from your exploding shipim just wondering how much of a shift is needed in what direction
delicious ninja tears
if only
ive gotta say i support aidens viewpoint here if someone uses a tactic you find a way to counter it like wardeccing that neutral orca pilots corp or something similar this is eve after all
scruffy seconds you made a very convincing point both here and on your blog this is indeed a sandbox
this one at least existsonto the main point dueling is a dead art if youre going to 1v1 with a wartarget make sure theres no orca around if youre going to actually fight the war then bring some more friends and pop the guy before he can switch or just keep putting his ships down into hull until he has no choice but to lose one then pod him
i dont see much of a problem here living with risk is what makes eve eve
support legion has the weakest cov ops of them all
you forget that lasers pay for that small margin extra damage in capacitor use in worse tracking in inability to swap damage types and in powergrid and cpu if lasers were so zomgwtf powerful to justify such an anemic ship bonus why are laser myrmidons the rarity while autocannon myrmidons are dominanttake a look at the omen if lasers are so ridiculously powerful i suppose we should remove the rof bonus on that ship too oh right i seem to recall another petition on these boards reminding people what a failure of a ship that platform isyes lasers do more damage than most other turret platforms at a more consistent range  and they pay for it appropriately in the base module attributes saying that this compensates for a 20 loss in effective turrets is not only misrepresenting the facts its idiotic
microtransactions may lead to increased revenue but not to a better gamei played lotro for a couple days and nothing was more jarring than you must pay 250 turbine points to do this dungeon or whatever totally breaks immersion and ruins the fun of the game
mechanics should apply equally to everyone
ccp do what ever you want many ppl will be ed and perpetuum go live in few weeks up to you
meh
ed idea use your brain theres enough ways to grief people even in high sec we dont need a day where pvp wannabes camp the starter systems to kill noobs in bantams to make sure they dont subscribe
a day without concord hell yes best idea ever
day before concords day off 45000 players onlineconcords day off 2000 players onlineday after concords day off 45000 players online
except those s do that now with bait cans fleet tricks etc i doubt there will be a sudden and drastic rise in that type of hatery when there exist numerous highsec systems where the cluelessbrave attempt to go about their daily routines as if nothing was going on pretty much anyone of those players will be flying something fitted with gear you might want to actually loot or that might actually be worth flying to their wreck to take unlike the free ships new players are given through the tutorials a better argument for those opposed to this is i pay for my game time and how dare anyone try to limit me from playing as i like even for a single day rage optional etca one day event like this publicized with popup warning when trying to undock could be a cool thing for people who dont want to try pvp and get popped before they even get to lowsec or dont want to die to a group of thugs who lay in wait if highsec had no concord working there at least exists a possibility of equal footing where everyone can attack anyone no concord intervention but of course no concord intervention works better for those that fleetup or do a corp op to hunt but there are still more people in highsec and therefore more chances to run into a other players where everyone isnt on the same side
only if concord is in lowsec space every day of the year  except this day

dear god yes supported
my thoughts exactly
nodear god do not be so freakin lazy as to not log in and keep your queue up to dateeve is a game of managed loss you forget to change your queue the last time you were on you deserve to lose those points
very yes there is integration in eve gate how about actually making it useful
supported and try explaining to them that time zone wars are utter 
posting to confirm the current system is terrible
have any of you idiots saying its counterable therefore its ok ever reinforced a jumpbride if so how long did it stay reinforced for you know given the game has triage carriers now
so now you want carriers to get nerfed now too anything else
im going to take you through this step by step slowly1 we all want this game to be more fun2 for it to be more fun  presumably and as you seem to want to get to places where fights are fast you too believe more fights are fun we all want there to be more battles more often3 the biggest reason we so many people are getting blueballed  bored  dont bother attacking space anymore is because it is too boring 4 it is boring because coalitions can simply stick whatever number of people they want in a system 5060 jumps away from where people are staging relatively easy please note that jumpclones are not as simple a matter because you dont get to choose your shiptypeshave spare stuff lying around5 jumpbridge networks not only make it very easy for large coalitions to defend and take their own space it also increases the effectiveness of defending their own jumpbridges meaning a coalition such as the nc will never  ever  never  ever have an issue with their jumpbridges being attacked 6 now all this is well and good but lets discuss what is so unreasonable about thisa this game is already stacked against the people who are going to fight outnumbered  assuming that the players are of roughly even skill level and knowledge so for the sake of argument two drakefleets fitted roughly the same  and this is as it should be there is nothing out of the ordinary hereb jumpbridges give the force with more numbers and even greater advantage why because you can bring together more numbers form a larger area of space in a relatively simple mannerc im not sure if you are familiar with this next concept but let me put it to you this way in most situations irlin most other games the choice between sheer numbers and smaller groups can be put down to a few things mobility and tactics which again i would be stupid to presume could make this game more fun the only thing making this game fun now is fast travel times for people anywhere so they can get blueballed because they brought too many yet again  what ccp has done including jbs and titan bridges is make larger numbers more mobile than smaller numbers which i believe to be a broken gamedesign which leads to the style of play and argument that you have used in this thread which is it is not our fault you should join a super coalition also and kill us which trust me is exactly as boring as it sounds d alliances have largely become impotent in the face of coalitions there is no point being in an alliance and trying to hold space any longer if you dont have loads of blues because of things like jumpbridges and titan bridges  this is where i get it is too easy for large coalitions because it is the major benefit you should recieve from joining forces with other alliances should be numbers based and as in most cases there should be some kind of deterant for doing this  or not deterant but at least reason to make a choice rather than bigger is always better in every single case  as i have already discussed i think the big and reasonable way to deal with this would be mobility it makes no sense to me whatsoever that the larger you get the more mobile and cohesive you should become like what on earth is thatthrough all of this i have never said if ccp doesnt completely remove jumpbridges its ridiculous and unfair i have said what i believe is reasonable ccp it shouldnt be a matter of making it more and more easy the larger your blob becomes the primary bonus should simply be in the numbers not in every single aspectthis in my eyes would deter a few more people from forming these supercoalitions and also in scaling back their power a tad bitnow in all of this your arguments have been as follows you can destroy jumpbridgesadapt or dieyou want easy moderelatively few of them between your fixing of my spelling and denail of my sincerity
now ive run out of room in that post and its difficult to expect any sort of dialouge from a post like that which is why i have been trying to get you on ts where it is far easier to discuss points and argue about them at a pace where it is clear to each party what is actually being saidand points can be mulled over till we are both satisfied what we have said has been understood and taken to heartbut if you want to keep correcting my spelling and somehow involving that in your masterplan about how im just trolling or something you go right aheadtagline of this thread making a decision like i am going to set this guy blue  comes with major advantages there seem to be few or no real disadvantages to setting lots and lots of people blue should this be the case and is this condusive to a fun game
oh another issue i believe caused by jbs which could reintroduce a lot more alliance warefare is that travel through coalition bridges has allowed alliances like razor to live further away from market hubs  entry points etc imagine what it would be like if instead of everyone being happy with any space they were given because of travel through blue bridges there was competition for the bestclosest regionsthat could be pretty fun i think
no one is making you leroy into the blobs that is on your own accord you want a change made in desperate hope so that when you throw yourself on the sword of the blob that you will come out without a scratch sorry but it just does not work that waynot supported give it up chromo effect
this is so ridiculous you cant expect anyone to believe that numbers will stop being important if jumpbridges are less accessable to blues or require more time to go through there are these other things called stargates you knowthe entire thing im trying to get looked at is just to make it more reasonable not flip the switchi cant believe im still the one being accused of wanting easy mode
you are the one asking for ccp to change a key game mechanic to help your effort to hurt those who have spent years of operation planning devotion etc to get their highway infrastructure down you want ccp to hit a button to destroy it all sorry if we are not running in here patting you on the back and saying it is a good ideawe put forth a tremendous effort fought off several wars while you dont want to put forth any effort remotely close to that to have it all torn down
project unholy rage is a continuing project which is active even now they do track this stuff and punish the offendersunfortunately the result of this is that accounts are being hacked to steal the isk im against macroers but im also against ccp invading the kernel to detect thirdparty programs like some other companies do coughblizzardcough preventing macros is a tough battle that will honestly never endwhile i support the fight against macroers i trust that ccp is doing everything they can as the economy which the macroers affect is the main thing keeping this game going ill support this measure as much as asking them to roam the game and interact with it but theres not really much they can do without alienating their playerbase
yea macros should have no place in eve and game mechanics should not offer isk for macroable activitiesi attribute the macro ratting problem to the weird game mechanic that the fattest rats are even in the most emptiest of systems no very plausible btw also that ratting itself is basically riskfreeid suggest two solutions1 make ratting less offensively dumb and riskfree give them rats a few tools that will kill macro player ships like rat hot drops after a rat puts a point on the player balanced so that a player will barely get away if he chooses a good burn away vector2 introduce a game mechanic that ensures that the fattest rats spawn in systems with lots of shippod kills while  empty space remains well rather  empty
just a minor change that would make scanning less of pain sometimes  the arrows on scanningat the moment they are flattened arrows and sometimes difficult to pull in the right direction or even click on in certain angles see the picture below for what i meancurrent modelwhat i propose is simple change the shape of arrows to something to a cylinder with a cone on top like this excuse my paintnet skillsnew modelthis would make the arrows look easily draggable from all directions easing the scanning process
for the love of all that human yes
simple and cleverdo want
i proposed a scanning change like this like 5 months ago but it died cause of other threads  but had alot of support
i had a problem where the arrows were gray in colorthus blending in with the orbsi later found out that it was that the graphic setting was set to medium thus making the arrows gray i put the graphic option to high and the arrows turned white making the arrows easier to grab would be nice
yes
in before phallus jokealso 1
it seem ccp are not able to create folderno dev read move 
cant believe that the current contact management made it past any kind of review ffs of course you want to put them into categories at least i want to tag a contact entry with some information like changed to red because its xyzs repping alt

stereo glasses support for gamebecause its cool and also i think its will be very comfortable for scanning and map browzing well and also a last reason to buy them 
stereoscopy is just a hype ccp should better fix bugs instead

current situation when a player opens bookmarks in people and places all of the bookmarks are shown bookmarks for the current system are shown in green most of the time the player is not interested in seeing bookmarks outside the current system the loading of unnecessary bookmarks can cause lag increase server load and consume excess bandwidthproposal introduce filters for bookmarks that are similar to the tabs in the assets screen by default only show bookmarks for the current system group bookmarks by system with all systems shown as collapsed by default except for the current system for these system groups the right click menu should include location it should also be possible to show a flat list in the current style and to search for bookmarks with particular namesexampledevoiddomainamarrchavenpenirgmansafe spotveldsparyoulessencethe above is what a character may see when filtering bookmarks by region while in the domain region the character is in penirgman so the penirgman bookmarks are expanded the character has other bookmarks in devoid and essence regions clicking on another system would expand the bookmarks for that system and may also collapse lists of bookmarks for other systems as set in the preferences

im going to support this using isk keeps microtransactionaries happy and it also gives those who want it extra remaps
lesser of two evilsbut a well thoughtout lesser evil1
from a user that would sell a plex to make isk it would be the same either way yes from an ingame economy point of view it is a massive differencea plex sold for isk in game doesnt remove any isk just moves it from one player to anothera remap sold for isk in game is the same as buying a new clone the isk is destroyed
in my opinion there were some modules that would create effects that you wanted to train for just so you have the pleasure of seeing them or bits of eyecandy that make everyday life more enjoyableive got a small list of things that imo changed for the worst after the apocrypha expansiona cyno jumpingwhilst i must agree that the effect of cyno jumping was rather large and buggy the concept idea of it was brilliant and it certainly made you crap yourself when you saw it the bubble jump effect we have now just doesnt recreate that and considering when your zoomed out a little bit its hard to notice that capitals are jumping in i propose we bring back the old jumping effects here is a reference video
well 1 but its been mentioned many times arleady and someone from ccp says that they planing to change all effects in future anywaybtw missiles look like fireballs to me seriously maybe they should be bigger and also more visible trail of it so not just a engine flare of it will be visible
personally i love the tournaments but if theyre held too often they will loose their value it would end up just being an every day thing that noone really cares about but in its current form you have the majority of the members in most of the major alliances and many of the smaller ones all gathering around a single event that people actually do care about
ok the sbu spamming is out of control the ability to just rage drop all the gates and surrounding systems and take over while the owners are asleep is dumb at least give the defenders a chance to protect their spaceonly allow one sbu to be onlined in a system every 24 hrs this will allow the appropriate time for the owners to form a fleet and defend their space
you want to add to the sov grind me sits back with popcorn and waits for the showchromo effectdouble dee this will not happen
first of all the time can be negotiated second of all no one should be able to do a hostile take over in three hours lastly i am not chromo effect minigin is chromo effect with his recent assembly hall post along with it being right after chromo deleted his character and the fact that minigins post and ideas are really terrible there can be no other conclusion
another prettycoloredtext bit reallyanyways no you cannot take over in 3 hours anybody who told you that is simply wrong you can if you get 3 uninterrupted hours and successfully deploy sbus start the sov grind which can last days if not weeks if you have competent defenders hell no lets not extend that even extending it by 12 hours per sbu would mean that in a system with four gates it would take 36 hours of uninterrupted and unopposed sbu anchoring before you could start contesting sov to say nothing of a 24 hour timer between sbus hell no

posting to confirm there should be filters in items and assetssome categoriessize slots cpu  or  than powergrid  or  than meta level damage type
supported as long as harder to scan down cant out mine a hulk or mac can fit gas harvesters and only be able to actually mine in low sec or 00 ie the harvesters wont work high sec align faster and have better defence all depending on the subs you choose i think being able to fit covert ops cloaks is a bad idea in my opinion as some have stated they would like that sub in thread very interesting idea though op
why would anyone use a ship worth a billion to mine less efficiently than a hulk ninja mining  then there will be another problem how do you intend to transport tenshundreds of thousands m3 unless this ship can get a really big ore cargo which would a bit op i fearand even then arent you better off using a ship that is actually designed to be and pacify in hostile space and rat there 
haha that would be awesome
give people a mike and ask them what they like about eve and what they think needs fixed and why its broken

i like this idea if outposts are left permanent forever eventually all of 00 will look like empire and some regions already do i participated in creating the madness that is providence
good stuff supported doubt itd make it in anytime soon but theres always hoping
players brought outposts into this world and we should be able to take em out theoretically you could use this to self destruct an outpost so you can place a new one of your liking in its place though it would have to be for a very good reason to spend all that isk
would be fun but not practicalthe problem isnt that stations are too cheap but that its better to place them now due to them being involved with sovlike before people would drop 50 large towers at 360 mill each 18 bill which is the equivalent to a stationalso i remember someone from ccp saying why it couldnt happen when someone asked asked about a station class ship that could move about
no00 is not utilized enough as it is making outpost destroyable will just make even fewer folks in 00 it is counterproductive
1baww nullbear tears please dont bring that not enough players in 00 crap up again there are plenty of targets i mean players out here and more than enough stations too allowing them to get ed places at least some pressure on alliances to pr
counterpoint the last qen snapshot showed that 37 of characters were in 00 spaceadditionally the csm have already passed the proposal as per deidres post above
idea is good i am all for killing stations  outposts but lets be realistic here if ccp allowed this you would just get bigger alliances griefing smaller alliancesdont get me wrong i really like the idea of this but we all know how the fat guys work in this game and for easy kills they will attack things smaller than them just for the sake of attackingeitherway i will support since it does promote more pvp but thats not to say it wont be abused

people shouldnt be able to swap ships in mid combat period if the enemy was in an orca and could be shot i wouldnt mind as much but if the orca can sit there with a load of ships and coninuously pump out new ones for the wt with no reprocusions theres something wrong
well i believe there is really no reason why any additional graphical effect should do any performance loss on servers but in fact that feature should have an option to be able to disable in the game options nevertheless bring them back ccp 
if that was the case someone doesnt know how to code this should be a client only effecttoo many great old effects have been changed if ccp played eve they would never have made some of these decisions
that is why amarr ships need a capacitor usage bonus so that the lasers cap usage is less than that of hybridsbeam lasers have much  43  50  better tracking than railguns or artillery so that is completely false for long range lasers for short range lasers they have slightly less tracking  23  30  than blasters or autocannons however in the short range class lasers have vastly  233  400  longer optimal rangehybrids cant swap damage types either the ability to swap turret damage types is unique to projectilescan you justify this statement with comparable fittings on strategic cruisers where lasers have worse fitting attributes amarr ships have better fitting attributes likewise where hybrids or projectiles have worse fitting attributes gallente and minmatar ships have better fitting attributes the ships are balanced to fit their intended weapon system comparing fitting attributes of turrets without looking at the fitting requirements of the ships they are used on is meaninglessthe popular choice in fitting myrmidons is not relevant to the bonuses assigned to a covert ops legion the problem with the omen was that it was out done by the maller the omen with a damage bonus had the same damage output as a maller which had an extra turret slot along with a bonus to resistances the omen was given a 5th turret so that it could fill a distinct roll by doing something better than the next closest amarr ship i dont know where you are coming up with the idea that the omen should have it damage bonus removed amarr ships can have damage bonuses but generally they require a cap usage bonus first the exception is the abaddon which was specificly balanced to be a damage dealer that had major cap problems while such a balancing approach makes sense for a teir 3 battleship it does not make sense for a covert ops strategic cruiserwhat do you mean a 20 loss in effective turrets that statement does not make sense did you miss a word or two in there some where where do you get the 20 loss of anything from
id prefer a 5 damage bonus but range is at least useful if it were up to me id remove the 10 cap usage bonus from all amarr ships range and tank are amarrs strengths cap usage is their disadvantage the abaddon is the only amarr ship that really matches their stated design philosophy the rest are half assed versions that ccp wimped out on and yeah throw autocannons on a legion and you have nearly the same range far superior tracking and about the same damage and its selectable its like the autocannon punishermallerprophecy all of them need that cap usage bonus changed

seriously they need to get rid of the effing learning skills already
the road to hell is paved with micro transactionsill just have to dust off my consoles if eve goes that waythat is just not the game i want to playmacro miners are already a pain in the ass why is ccp trying to roll out things that are unbalancing and silly instead of fixing the stuff that needs work now like lag and macrominers and illegal rmt stuffi cant believe that ccp cant immediately spot 237 macro miners just by simple parsing of playtime logsif ccp needs a few more bucks to keep the game going right just up the subscription a bit id would happily pay an extra few bucks to keep things going the right direction instead of having rich people buy their way to the top moreso than they already can
agreed this is a step in the wrong direction supported

problem too many people are degrading these great forums by using numerous characters to post in the same thread skewing arguments or having devils advocate debates with themselves much to the chagrin of other participants in the debate its nonconstructive and in recent years has become more than just a quaint idiosyncrasy practiced by certain eve ecelebrities solution remove the ability to post with more than one character on an account in a single threadto wit i post this proposal thread with this character a faceless alt ive just created i could then use two other characters on this same account to support the idea or create drama like a lot of players i have two accounts i could theoretically then load this argument by using 6 characters to post supportive arguments skewing everythingif this proposal were enacted i would have the amount of sockpuppet posting available to me reduced by 67 promoting by necessity more thoughtful responses to whatever it is i am talking abouttldr you should be able to post with your main or post with an alt  but not both in the same thread from one account quality  crap quantity vthank you

supported limiting a thread to a single response from a character on any account makes sense and doesnt hurt anyone by suppressing their options to make themselves heardonly possible issues are people who mistakenly post as a character they didnt intend to and out themselves but such things can happen regardless of a requirement like this if a person is using alts to mask their identity they should put forth the effort to choose the correct one for whatever argumentpostideaetc they intend to submit

this would make eve gate useful
i thought that was the main reason for evegate skill queuemodification from the webi was wrong make it so pls
again not very good trolling but very very funny the game should be fun but not fun as defined as how individuals like to play the game from large scale sov warfare to lowsec roams no fun is what mini wants and if you dont want it youre antifunbattles cant be fun if there are lots of people involved indeed theyre almost impossible due to jump bridgeslogistics shipstitansmeanies who work in teams the pendulum war the first or second great wars the max campaign the war of southern aggression the current invasion of the drone regions none of those actually happened and those people who flyflew in them didnt enjoy them at all in point of fact not only have none of those actually happened but theyre pretty much impossible and jumpclones dont count either because pilots can not even possibly have staging systems filled with ships mods and exotic dancers likewise alliances cant simply park titans in poss and set up jump chains that way even if every alliance needed their own titan to bridge in only their own alliance membership the nc will never ever have an issue defending its jump bridges except of course for examples like the recent war of southern aggression when not only were jbs incapped but many were permacamped by bomber gangs that reaped tallies of dozens and dozens of battleships on numerous occasions when bridges ran out of fuel andor pilots were slow to click jump but thats impossible so it never happened mini needs ccp to help protect him because without friends you cant easily stand against a large group of buddies in an mmo ccp must save him and mini cant adapt and simply engage in only smallgang combat because hed like to be able to challenge those large groups of people who have the audacity to work together and so ccp needs to save him but really its the people who work together andor attack people who are working together and who take their time in eve into their own hands who want easy mode its not the guy who cant manage to do that and who wants ccp to save him nopers high ing comedy
really if i wanted easy mode i would just join your coalitionthe point is that it is not fun as defined by me and as would be defined as you in all your whine threads to ccp about fixing the lag in larger engagmentsheres a newsflash for you it doesnt matter how much ccp reinforce nodes or works on their servers your coalition will always recruit more lemmings and dump them into a server so that its at breaking point simply so that you can winnot so that you can have fun if you want to confuse the two then thats fine but you are deluding only yourselves
this is relavent to my interestsi live under a jump bridge and the traffic keeps me up at all hours 
ccp needs a punkbuster for eve
please evemail me about a bridge i have for salei dont understand what you mean by this
there is plenty they could do to greatly hamper macroing without alientating their playerbasehere ill lay out a few freebies some of these are supereasy very simple fixes some arent but all of them would actively improve the game for human players while strongly nerfing macros1 add a heavy deposit to losec courier missions so that failing them is expensive this would mean that killing macrohaulers would actually have some effect other than destroying a 300k isk hauler2 give us the mining and industrial expansion weve been promised since 2007 make mining an active activity not a passive one remove static belts reduce the proportion of orebearing asteroids to 510 so miners have to actually find the good rocks in a belt and make mining itself a semiactive process you could do this by providing a pseudo 3d image of the rock with veins and nodes of minerals the challenge would be to align and focus the mining beams to hit the high concentrations whilst ignoring the dross add slow rotation or movement of the rock so that constant adjustment and monitoring is required for peak efficiency peak potential mining yield would be 510x higher than at present so an active intelligent miner who efficiently extracts the concentrated ore is strongly rewarded over a dumb macro who will just mine the whole rock at hugely lower efficiencythere could also be the potential to find small nodes of midend minerals in hi sec rocks and highend minerals in losec rocks etc just to add another dimension of complexity to the optimal mining solution3 change rats to be far fewer like 90 less in number and much more effective give them remotely realistic fits and upgrade the ai so that its actually a challenge to kill them correct size modulesmore than 1 damb weapon will move into their optimal will use different ammo types will summon reinforcements will attempt to escape increase perrat rewards accordingly all elite frigate rats should have tackle all frigate rats in losec should have tackle all frigate and cruiser rats in nullsec should have tackle ratting and missioning should actually be dangerous not an utterly predictable utterly safe grindin short when eves pve isnt easily done by macros macros will not be so prevalent no doubt it is impossible to completely eradicate macrobots but there sure is a lot that could be done to make things much harder for them that would also make the game much more fun to play eves pve is literally a joke in the mmo community and thats just a shame good challenging pve isnt giving in to the carebears its just making eve a better game
it is glaringly obvious when someone is using a macro it is a terminal disease that plagues highsec lowsec and nullsec exterminate
ibt in before trolls
i approve of this ideaa simple yet effective cosmetic change good thinking son
i think the removal was part of their ui cleanup stuff and they intend to put it back in but either way i agree  this should be usable vs how it is now
when i am trying to scan something down one of the most bothersome things is the fact that i cant see the space that all of my probes are covering because its all just boundaries of sphere and nothing changes colors at allso why not make it so that volumes that are covered by more than one probes put in a different color to make it easier to see2 could be green 3 could be yellow 4 could be purple or something so long as it doesnt make it harder to see the red dots that one is trying to scan downmaybe those arent the best colors but its just a thought
you should have been here for scanning before apoc expansion
this this a thousand times this
how does it being more difficult before apocrypha make it so that it shouldnt be made even better than it is now thats doesnt make sense
looks liek a cross between a brutix and a proteus 2 of my top 5 fav ships im in
i would buy that ship instantly
link this thread to your friends lets keep that ship aliveits awesome
i mean im not like srying my eyes out wanting it it would just had one more aspect of realism to the game
cant remember if theres a skill for this or not but if there isnt there should be
i second develdrins logic
i would like to see smarter npcs which do things like run away this is only because missions are a little predictable at this time not because i believe that making npcs smarter will encourage antisocial mission runners to suddenly become more socialthere is nothing stopping mission runners from running missions in groups at the moment  done properly you can increase efficiency due to fewer trips back to station to hand in missions and less time waiting between volleysthere is nothing stopping mission runners running level 3 and 4 missions in assault ships or cruisers for that extra edgeoftheseat excitementthere is nothing stopping mission runners flying pvp ships into lowsec or nullsecyet they do none of those things
qfti would love to have mission npcs fly more intelligently warping off might be a little much unless they also warped back at some point but having them for instance change damage types or changing up the fits of their ships so that theres more unpredicability in the missions would be niceimagine rr fits in angel extravaganza or blockade
wtfwell anyway if missions will be more difficult its automaticly make them more proffitable because market prices is higly influenced by carebears altrough there is more proffitable thing than missions
i played the first 10 rounds of itso far its a really fun mini gamewould be nice to see something that helps the world integrated into evejust look what sony did with folding on the ps3 biggest donation team on the planet hands down
they did they were called titans they got nerfed
no and you are stupid if you believe otherwise
wear csm v shirts so we can gushlushthrow rotten tomatoesyou guys have been there a couple of times already so presumably youll be getting to know the local nightlife not mentioning any names but a particular pilot from pl should be really familiar with icelanding boozing spots announce a particular bar for each night of the whole time that you folk are there so we can decide whether to get drunk with csm or ccp or both be visible be accessible help reykjaviknoobs find their way around geek style  thats all i can think of 
tbh if id have voted for you i would be royally ed nowthank god i do not tend to vote for drama queens or joke candidates pizza  my vote still counts
discussion phaseproposal background a fully player driven economy is a stated goal of ccp removing npc pos goods introducing pi and dropping the mineral basket were bold steps in this direction continuing to remove limitless quantities of npc goods and providing a more capitalist player driven economy is beneficial to everyone furthermore the mechanics to implement this seamlessly already exist in gameproposal allow players to spend accumulated datacores to create skill books and t1 blueprints use rd agents to manufacture injectable skills and blueprints by combining datacores of various racial and technical types to create skill books and t1 bposskill book mechanics skill books would require a combination of datacores relevant to the skill being produced cost scaling for foundation or lower priced skillsracial frigates for examplewould be achieved by each single run producing multiple books agent standings should play a very small if any part in this transaction to allow everyone the ability to commission skill booksblueprint mechanics commissioning a blueprint would require a combination and quantity of datacores relevant to the blueprint being produced this would easily scale with the cost of the bpo and again it would be initiated through a conversation with the rd agent while possessing the required datacores agent standings should play a very small if any part in this transaction to allow manufactures the ability to buy datacores and commission blueprintscons possible increase in t2 prices due to datacore consumption in noninvention processes offset by below conditionsccp summary with the removal of ghost rp accumulation there are now numerous accounts loaded with characters designed to produce massive amounts of rp to fully leverage these accounts get them to subscribe consistently the rp program must be worthwhile this is a means to further empower active industrialists and the eve economy while also injecting more consistent subscribers into the playerbase without hurting the new player experiencethis is a simple effective way to expand the industrial aspects of eve and further empower the player basediscussion phasethis idea is open for discussion  debate prior to being posted in the assembly hall feedback and perspectives are appreciated
i have some bad news theyre already planning to expand pi to enable people to make t1 bpos as for skillbooks i think ccp is keeping those as an isk sinkpersonally i hope they make the pi requirements for bpos high enough so that we dont have what happened to pos modules
i recall a dev post about considering this but no definitive statement have you any definitive referenceand that is the crux of the matter the game need isk sinks and isk faucets a purely player driven economy require a very precise balance between isk faucets and isk sinks but removing or heavily reducing ratting and mission running as isk faucets would make life almost impossible for new players or old players not interested in production and trade i doubt most players will be interested in a game where you need to mine for the first month of your life to get the isk to start rd research to start skillbook production to finally get your first bs after 6 months of preparation and training a lot of science skills
