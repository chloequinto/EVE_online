i wonder how third party devs would do without you steve good luck for csm x
hooray for hats  but all the other points sound quite good too ive read your suggestions on mining and the whole claim based approach and really like the idea also pos changes would be great good luck o

ganking is an essential park of the gameplay experience i try not to look at things as right or wrong as they relate to the development of eve online attaching morality to a sandbox is very problematic if not toxic at the player level you can believe whatever you want and act on those ideologies
definitely support more highsec pve player on the csm good luckas far as wardeccs consider the following marmite collective recently wardecced my 1 man corp is there any conceivable game mechanic that will get me to fight them at 901 odds and given that all they do is train and practice pvp absolutely not its either dec dodge npc corp or dock up and play on alts the fact that they are even able to dec me is the problem and shows why the wardecc system is fundamentally broken hopelessly one sided wars with no chance of a defender victory do not lead to interesting gameplay they just lead to boredom i would hope that if you are elected csm you would examine whether wars serve any purpose in highsec in fact there is some crazy statistic out there than 90 of the losses are incurred by one side of the war on average these are turkey shoots not wars
dear mr belvarthank you for taking an interest in my campaign i hope that you will use your votes correctly come voting day i had a conversation including someone on my corps that seemed to think that not voting was also sending a message might i ask what you use your 1 man corps for does being in a 1 man corps bring any advantages for you as a player over being in an npc corps other than taxesthis also comes to what people have been saying about looking that the corporation system as a wholeyou know that stuff about social corporations with no gameplay relevance vs corporations that want to build structures do things and have gameplay relevanceif your 1 man corporation is an entity that excerpts some direct influence on the game eg dropping secure containers with messages then there has to be a mechanism for someone to attackstop you this is eve after allbut if this one man corporations exists solely so that all your alts fly under the same banner then that is a different matter i thinkbut why would someone want to stay in a one man corporation wouldnt joining a group of others enable more interaction and involvement maybe once the awox removal hits that will reduce the one men corporationswar is not necessarily always about having a fair fight but i agree that the mechanism as it is is hopelessly broken almost as bad as the bounty system tora bushido is also running for the csm and if you read his thread and the linked interview well you will see that hewhoisprobablyhighsecsprimewardeccer has some ideas on making things more balanced i read his interview and i find some of his ideas good but i will give him time to write his long post and present them before i steal them
i use a one man corp to evade the 11 npc tax rate when running incursionsl4s the 11 is an irritating tax that serves to reduce your rewards by joining a 1 man corp and just folding and reforming when you get wardecced you avoid the 11 in taxesjoining multimember corps in highsec is pretty terrible right now awoxxingwardeccstheft make them basically useless you can essentially capture all the benefits just by fleeting up and chatting so all the corp does is give you donwsidesfundamentally the problem with highsec wars is you cant force people to fight if necessary i will make 6 incursionl4 alts just dock up whoever gets wardecced and play on one of the other ones since there is no way to punish docking up and playing on alts wars themselves become a joke personally i think that highsec would be better off if we just got rid of nonmutual warsas far as toras ideas his main suggestion was to make it more expensive to dec smaller corps and cheaper to dec larger ones any analysis of his ideas must take into account that most of his income comes from deccing larger groups so he has a pretty major conflict of interest
greetings capsuleersmy name is tora bushido blowfish70 and i am running for csm x my main focus will be on a new highsec for all of new edenUFFFDs citizens not just for the UFFFDgoodUFFFD or UFFFDbadUFFFD guys but a new fun highsec for all of us and yes i know there are many more capsuleers outside of highsec who want their voice to be heard too but i donUFFFDt want to be one of those csmUFFFDs who hasnt been in a certain part of space for ages and still thinks he knows everything about it eve changes fast and your knowledge gets outdated quickly if you donUFFFDt keep up so i would rather focus on the area iUFFFDve been living in the last few years if you want to read what iUFFFDve done so far in eve read the fun written player profile by feyd besides my wh background and current highsec experience i am also still active in nullsec on my alts been active 247 in eve since 2010 i know itUFFFDs just a game but itUFFFDs also my passion i care about the game and want to see it going on for at least another 10 years itUFFFDs easy to complain about UFFFDbadUFFFD things from the sideline but i rather be active myself and try to find solutions for problems do i know it all hell no but i am the kind of guy who really listens to players and finds common grounds to build upon i can analyze problems very fast and can break things down to the base of it simple is often the best solutionmost of you probably know me as the alliance leader of the marmite collective a group of like minded guys who just enjoy shooting things in marmites we donUFFFDt do politics if you want to have a good time and youUFFFDve got what it takes youUFFFDre welcome because of this policy weUFFFDve got good relations with a lot of alliances corps and players all over eve most of us donUFFFDt take things to personal and just enjoy the game as we see fit if it is needed for the game i will also accept things that might not be in the best interest of my own alliance weUFFFDre just a small part of a greater eveeach area of space has its own challenges the ideas below are not the basis for my campaign but to act as a spark plug for getting to the down and dirty of these kind of issues while this approach might turn the stomachs of manyUFFFD if one canUFFFDt identify the down and dirty from the player base then what good is the csm iUFFFDm here to listen and i want more of your ideas so letUFFFDs get down to businessganking in highsec i think ganking is a part of eve and i want it to stay but we need to add something new right now itUFFFDs to easy to warp out of a station gank something warp your pod back to station and wait till the timer runs out the hideout UFFFD a mobile deployable unit that shadows criminal targets from concord while of course criminals will lose their ships and they canUFFFDt undock in another ship they could still undock in a pod and warp to this 15km area to hide in new ships the hideout will also tick down the timer twice as fast while they are in range and in a ship what this does is provide opportunities for anti ganker movements to hunt gankers who may find this unit useful to quicken their return to another gankafk while in space on the same grid highsecif youUFFFDre logged in and undocked i think you should also be active behind the keyboard players should press a notification button every x minutes if they are still on the same grid in space one of the reasons i think people go afk while mining is because itUFFFDs boring to watch the screen while doing so i want to add a mini game for the miners what kind you tell me i want this only for highsec as in the other parts of eve youve got a way higher risk of dieing because of itwar decsthe war dec system needs to change to many new corps in highsec are destroyed by war decs which is bad for keeping people motivated to stay in highsec or even in eve itself once they are a bit bigger 25 they at least have a chance fighting highsec isnUFFFDt for pussies so letUFFFDs not do more then really needed or we will nerf the game to death i would suggest double the war dec costs for the first group up to 50 players and let the rest as it is making the costs go from 50m to 100m might not seem much but i can tell you from experience itUFFFDs a lot when you have so many wars running as we have or when you are a small griefer corp i would be ok if this raise is only for corps more then for example 50 players this way the smaller less rich doing less damage corps can still do their thingsocial corp npcyou shouldnt be able to stay longer then 23 months in a npc corp players should be able to create small social corps with max 10 players in it which canUFFFDt be war decced can still be ganked but they also canUFFFDt own a pos poco or future structure and they canUFFFDt war dec someone else this might look bad as they can freely do anything they want but if you look at it more closely they can still do the same things as they could do in an npc corp only this way they have the chance to build up a corp see it as a stage between npc and a corp the social corps do need to pay an x amount of tax or it will just become another taxwar avoiding corp incursionsnot sure if there are current issues if so mail meremember changes are made by taking small steps dont start running before you can walk or you will drop on the floortora bushidocampaign

industryincrease the agility of t2 freighters so itUFFFDs easier to haul cargo and harder for gankers to keep them bumped create a multi sell option select what you want see the total and decide to buy or not create a multi contract option so its easier for example to contract bpcs got 100 bpcs select them all create contract for public per x bpcs for price ythe last few patches have already improved industry a lot i thinkdont nerf eve to deathsometimes nerfs are needed but lets not kill eve with to many if i think eve is getting to nerfed i will bring in more darkness if its to dark shine more light and to keep this fun for the entire community i talk and listen to people even to people i personally do not likedreadsi want dreads back in highsec for more large pos fights and it will create a better market for themcontactsi want an export and import contact lists function or even better make something similar as the overview drag contacts to link other character clicks it and has the same contacts standings etcgraphical user interfacei want to create a better gui for you capsuleers i am not happy with the new gui colors icons etc we need more importexport options and long time bugs should be fixedimplants from corpsesan autopsy skill that gives you a chance of recovering implants from corpsesfaction policei wouldnUFFFDt be against removing the faction police so we would see more players with 5 or lower in highsec interaction between highsec and any other part of eve can only be good it also shows players from highsec that there is more then just highsec where most start in there are enough players in highsec to still shoot them so i donUFFFDt really see the need for the policeunaccessible highsec stations for piratesmaking highsec stations unaccessible for pirates is not something i would support right now unless someone could convince me why itUFFFDs really good idea concord officesi want a concord office in every lowsec system i hope this will attract more highsec players to lowsec as its easier to buy your security status back this waymaking decisions as a csm should not be about feelings but factsfor people who think i will turn highsec in to a nerfed wow disneyland never  the following players i would endorse for csm x random order  bobmon xander phoena corebloodbrothers corbexx sabriz manfred sideous sion kumitomo steve ronuken migui xUFFFDhyrrn endie von posts

prior to knowing your position on intracorp aggression i had intended to have you on my list of recommended candidateshowever if you are successful in achieving a major increase in safety for career empire pveers the targets of highsec corp infiltrators youll simply accelerate the trend toward nullsec and wormhole players carrying out their wealth generation activities in highsec instead of fighting to assert their ability to generate wealth in dangerous spaceyoull also remove one of the best ways for rookie players to get their first pvp experiences awox ransoming is something i have seen several people do as their first step into the sandbox and the thing that broke me from my initial eve path of level up my dominix was a mercenary infiltrating my first corp and blowing someone up to fill a contracti dont live in wormholes and even ive noticed the number of people migrating out of them over the last couple of years as people move their isk generating activities to highsec and grind incursions in relative safety i hear the wormholer complaints theres too many predators not enough prey and as a wh outsider im concerned that wspace may end up looking even more like nonfw lowsec if theres many more buffs to highsec safetynewer players should be given firm warnings that joining a corporation opens them up to intracorp pvp a dismissable warning thats the reverse of the one you are given when you join a fleet but its not new players in their battlecruisers and ventures that get shot in infiltrationawox incidents it is career pveers and miners in their orcas and pirate faction battleships the first unplanned pvp most new players encounter is a gatecamp when they derp and buy a skillbook in a dangerous lowsec system not an awoxer

finaly someone i can stand behind and might get me to vote for csm again
endie posts we can believe in and changes we can stand behind
i read the blog posts how do these principles hold up in the context of the pheobe changesfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
i believe that they were not only compatible with it but that something like them was necessary for the balkanised eve id like to see i posted at the time i think that the article was called fifty scales of gray to say that i welcomed them i disagreed with a few details but those were changed anyway before it went liveedit it is also important to stress that the csm are not game designers all they can really do is help provide feedback and input ccp will not try to implement something some random blogger dreams up in his capacity as amateur game designer
im sad to see mynnna standing down but its his call of all of the nullsec blocaligned representatives since ive followed the csm ive thought highest of him i see you share several of his views on null sov but with some additional thoughts of your owni will read up closely on your campaign platform as you release it
hope  change
i was the one who proposed the removal of highsec awoxing not ccp
i dont know much about you but why should i vote for you over djfunkybacon or should i have both of you on my ballotalso what is your opinion on the recent capital changes in pheobefounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
because funky isnt running for one 
hisorry if this subject has been solvedeve is good for trading but i dont see anything about shares exchangeswhy it could bring  money for corporations a way for corporations to broadcast to new members a new trading dimensionthanks for your answersregards
because the current share system is too vulnerable to being taken advantage of shares can be too easily bought up when released resulting in corp theft
the problem is ccp is well known to fire shots without checking the target first i wonder what the ban count on this change is actually going to be for people that actually alttab between accounts like you and me to some people when they mine in same clusters as i do they think the lasers firing up is simultaneous on all accounts even if theres that small time between clicking each eve window in the bottom bar and pressing f1f3 on all of them at the same timepersonally i was never bothered by isboxer or keystroke multiplicationsending it didnt bother anyone for years until isboxer controlled bomber wings started wreaking havoc upon the dogs of war or massive fleets mining the shiznit in highsec spaceup until that became a widespread common thing nobody gave a rats ass about multiboxers using isboxer or logitech g7 keyboards or keyclone utility software

steve rumours have reached me that your recipie for bolognaise sauce is made with disgusting slimy mince instead of good honest chopped beef how do you answer this vile scurrilous accusation
if your mince is slimy then youre not getting a decent mince ideally an extra lean steak mince and a lower fat pork mince once cooked youll have a mixture of sauce and fine bits of meat

you know that comment could be interpreted in several ways and not all of them particularly positive the csm is still valid yes but what do you want to turn it into its just a player elected body to represent players where the csm has problems is some of them think theyre game designers and theyve been elected to promote their ideas the only reform really need is the people putting themselves up for election who fail to realise what the csm actually is players representing other players and nothing more in fact their are other ways of doing what the csm does without actually having some elected body of self important players who constantly like to tell everyone else how important they are

hey tora good luck running a few questions i have to ask will you be making a push to flush out the wardeccing system such as giving defending corps more reason to fight so on and so forth a lot of eve players more so new ones seem to think the wardecs are imbalanced do you agree what are your current ideas on this topic will you work on making highsec corps more than social club as they are for the most part now if so how what are your opinions on npe and if you could make changes what would you change edit another question with the recent csm summit there was a scare about ccp taking about the ability to commit awox how do you feel about the subject would you change it remove it or keep it as it currently isdeletetheweak
both would work i have made myself a list with questions people have and suggestions how they think we can improve itlanctharus onzo  that would be nice but give me a week or so i need top get things properly on paper first i always think before i speak and i listen to your podcast all the time so i knew you were valkin mordirc  i will add those questions to the post i am working on short version  100 remove no reduce and protect where needed yesedit fixed quoting isd ezwal

it seems a lot of people join corps even when it isnt in their best interestwhat is your opinion on a social only corp being implemented into eveno pocos hangers or poses but cant be wardecced
thats nice to know i would have been on your recommended list could i ask why i would have been on itby mayor safety you mean corp on corp agression being removed i really cant see this suddenly getting people from null or wormholes to farm isk in hisec lets be honest if people in null and wormholes wanted to do that it could easily be done now and in a fair few cases is done already so yeah not something to worry about at all from that povincursion yes i agree is a issue however if you listen to as many people as i do about wormholes it seems the c1 to c4 is picking up nicely with all the nice buffs they have gotten recently c5 and c6 are still doing ok but could do with some loving its my next project to look at i dont think there is any issue of wspace turning in to nonfw lowsecdo you have any figures on this several people out of what all the new players who have started since you have been playing since you have been in code do you have any idea how many players do the corp on corp aggression compared to how many new players have left over this
good to hear that you have decided to run againas you are aware we at the cap stable podcast interviewed you during your run for csm9 and we wish to do the same this year for csm10here is our announcement
my support for you would have been for the work you did in encouraging pve in dangerous space particularly the sleeper loot changes i still regard that as excellent work and would support changes to make other forms of wealth generation activities such as mining more viable in wh space eve needs more incentive to be undocked and active in dangerous space whether that activity is fighting rats mining running exploration sites or whatever and the more those activities reward risking valuable assets the better the gameback to the point of contention starting with the question of newbiespeople awox ransoming as newbies  i only have anecdotes no hard numbers its a rare occurence despite my efforts to advise people in the forum newbie areas of the option and most people that do it as newbies are people that lose a ship to highsec predators then ask questions like how did you do that and get the necessary tips most newbies never realise its an option but where else can a 500k skillpoint character without external isk injection win a decisive pvp victory solo in eve through their own cunning preparation and initiativeyou claim new players leave over intracorp aggression what do you define as a new player ive been in and out of the main channel where these sorts of attacks are organised and as a result i know the people involved in these shenanigans target corps with orcas pirate faction battleships marauders and empire navy battleships expensive ships they watch traffic in level 4 mission hubs if their targets were new players theyd be going after places like simela level 23 soe mission hub and the newbie cruisers therethe main people that are hit hard by highsec intracorp aggression are people settling into a career of highsec mission running or highsec mining eve will not hold 90 of those people once they finish the process of levelling up from a dominix to an ishtar to a proteus to a vindicator to a kronos or their retriever into a mackinaw unless they are brought into the sandbox somehow those people arent newbies they are usually closer to 36 months old
i am not so sure about this if highsec awox removal allows the formation of large organized and stable incursion corporations many players may choose to move back to highsec and join them permanently right now the inherent social element of corporations is hampered by the aggression mechanics which prevent incursion corps so many players just have an npccorp alt doing incursions and still consider their main eve identity as a defined by the wormhole low or null corp they are part of if they can now join a permanent incursion corp and find a social identity they may just pack up and leave more risky space completely now although this would suck more life out of the more risky space and make for a less vibrant universe some would argue that increased social contact would be better for player retention in fact i support the proposed form of corplite which would allow the social benefits of but none of the game rewards of a player corporation therefore the problem comes back to the failure of implementing risk vs reward properly in highsec  incursion are just far far too rewarding for the level of risk corbexx what do you think is the best way to fix this without completely alienating players who love incursion gameplaybut back to the question of removal intracorp agression in highsec my main problem with it is that it will lower the bar of formation of a corporation even more than it is already any onemonth old player can form a corp and spam invites to other new players these new players will join learn nothing get frustrated and possibly quit the game there are natural hurdles for running a corp in lownullwhs as if you are clueless and dont understand game mechanics your corp or at least its assets will not last long but in highsec the threat of awoxing is one of the few ways to test corps and to weed out the failcorps that have no business existing in any case competent highsec corps have several mechanisms to protect themselves security checks dedicated training corps etc so all this change does is protect the lazy and clueless ceo and will encourage low quality corps to spam invites even more to new players as there is now zero risk to them new players deserve recruitment into better corps than many of the ones plaguing highsec today that are run by players who do not understand game mechanics or who are actively looking to exploit newbies with high taxes and low ore buyback prices if you are going to remove highsec awoxing at least put some mechanism in the game to help get new players into the larger competent highsec corps who care about training new players or better yet directly into a lownullwh corp
really one of the main reasons stopping incursion corps is war decs not awoxing lets be honest here not running wide with rumours and speculationincursions need looking at everyone knows that its in the minutes what really needs to happen is the incrusions that are over paid need it scaling back its pretty simple so your issue here is you dont think newbies should be allowed to form there own corps since they dont know much who should decide they have no business exsisting you your code mates you sound really anti newbie if they want to form a corp let them if it fails it fails if it succeds we might have the next brave newbie alliance your arguement for awoxing needs to stay is that you feel the need to have some mechanic to grief newbie corps that might just might not be up to some standard that you set wtfok so you being able to awox people is fine but people setting high tax rates isnt i will let ccp know right now black pedro feels corps setting tax high in hisec is bad for newbies along with low ore buy back yes last part would be useful and as you can see some stuff is happening to help like
i agree my comment was all speculation i have no evidence for my view and cannot predict the future but however neither can you i was just pointing out that such a change may have more consequences on the distribution of the eve population than apparent at first glance wardecs come with notification and can be dodged highsec awoxing cannot and this is the biggest problem preventing incursion corps currently i saw that in the minutes and your comments there that went a long way earning my support for your csm run which you have i agree by the way i just wonder why this hasnt happened yet as it is so obvious i can only assume ccp is concerned that the drastic changes that are necessary will upset a portion of the player base and personally i am not sure the best way to implement themnope i think players should not be provided with free protection of their corp yet given all the rewards of corp i agree if a corp is to fail it should fail  it should not be allowed to exist if it cannot manage the basic level of competence to protect its operations from outsiders awoxing for all player corps is not some standard that i set but is a competitive standard that all corps are subject to survivingdefending against awoxing is another proof of competency for a new corp something brave managed to do by the way as i said i support a corplite mechanism where players can form a corp that is free from wardecs and awoxing but has none of the advantages of a player corp but a proper player corp it has to take responsibility for its own protection if it wants to reap the rewards of a player corpits just simple risk vs rewardno i think that removing awoxing will increase the number of exploitative as well as just terrible highsec corps i would appreciate it if you relayed my concerns to ccp and encourage them to continue to develop tools to give newbies a chance to avoid them awoxing as it is only harms established players with the assets that make awoxing worthwhile who should know better while high tax rates exploit new players who have just joined their first player corp and dont know betterbut i will agree to disagree with you on this issue the risk vs reward problems with the income distribution in this game are much more important to me than awoxing and your views on this match mine and honestly removing awoxing isnt going to change much at all  there will be no beneficial effect on newbie retention and players relying on awoxing to disrupt highsec corps will find other ways

re the whole incorp aggression thing its not awoxing can we agree that the root problem is the disastrous state of corporations and corporation management in eve and that no fix short of a complete overhaul will be satisfyingthe change to prevent incorp aggression is an experiment whose success ccp is or should damn well be monitoring when ccp has the numbers to determine how well the change worked they have the option to revert it if it was a wash or worse the new rapidfire release cycle makes that easy for them to dothe best thing csm can do imo is ask them to define success in terms of the impact of the change keep on them to stick to that and to rolling it back if it fails and source and offer suggestions about how corporations should function in eve and even hat tip to mangala solaris if corporations should be the only social organizations eve offersas an aside true newbies dont have to be ganked to leave seeing it happen to their social group might be enough im not going to speculate on whether or how often that happens but if corporations are the glue that keeps people in eve then the shattering of a corporation may well be enough to drive them awayoh and 1 to corbexx even if he did stand us up when we invited him to chat with us the first time
here are the details about the issues i want to further if i get elected csm representatives can only be elected once this is important to make sure the csm seats truly represent all players each year and does not become a stagnant pool of power players make sure new features that encourage small groups actions like the siphons for example do not get nerfed to uselessness before they are introduced by the established power groups make sure api data availability does not provide too much out of game information and allow some kind of ingame data privacy option encourage new features that would truly allow for a nomadic life style in new eden make some of the carrier paths that are advertised to bring new people in the game to become realistic like bounty hunter request that all players link all their alts publicly with a slight change in the eula  participate to the new upcoming sovereignty changes to give a chance to smaller groups to truly own something without having to rent it develop the new player resources and first experiences in a more integrated way within the game

well hello theremy name is lanctharus onzo and i an one of the cohost and writers of the cap stable podcastin early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10here is our announcement
well hello theremy name is lanctharus onzo and i an one of the cohost and writers of the cap stable podcastin early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10here is our announcement
i was sending you an evemail when you sent that i definitely intend to schedule an interview with you and will try to run an ask me anything session sometime tooi do however need to buy a better mic before doing so as any of the people that have had the misfortune of being fleeted with me lately can attest to
may i recommend this
always been a headset person rather than a separate mic person because ive seen just how embarassing sounds from the rest of the world can be over commswhether the mic is set off by someones partner telling them get off that game and get into bed or someones mother yelling hurry up and do the dishes now or a tornado siren ive heard too many ridiculous noises transmitted to ever use anything but a headset
woah woah woah first i think you need a campaign manager so i am assuming my take is 10 this stuff has money involved right oh what am i saying clearly it does its politics but more importantly we need to discuss the set up at the green room for my newly found client there need to be a jar in said jar needs to be 184 blue mms next to the jar needs to be a scented candle lit two warm bottles of water a cold milk 1 three moist towelettes a copy of time from 6 quarters ago and three fedos i am sure there are reasonable requests for such an event clearly the post is meant to fall into the genera of humor i mean how else during his ama section can i question him about the would you rather redacted to direct family members name or generic horrible things involving tender body parts with a potato peeler i look forward to the date and hopefully can participate the terminal end of the digestive system
when i said ama that was not intended to include any of mr canals questions
had one time when we missed target calls because a train was driving past someones house and they had their mic set to voice activation no one on coms could hear anything except the train
my name is corebloodbrothers i was elected as a member of the ninth council of stellar management csm in order to represent you the players of eve online i am also one of the leaders of the volition cult alliance a providence sovereignty holder and member of the providence bloc which i function as one of their main fleet commanders little did i know of what was aheadi am 42 years of age dutch bad english spelling father of 4 daughters and i freaking love eve csm 9 election was my first seat i ran before but for 9 i focused on just my own list my  providence and other entities i have come to know over the years such as rnk for example who voted for me i stayed away from all the backroom dealing that went on with the previous csm elections so i had no crossvoting on my list nor did i appear on other lists and didnt need those either i got voted in bigbeing honest and loyal to the people i fly with against independent voters do exist in fact and i have had a lot of chats and eve mails with various people since i ran for csm many of which i have never met before also running fleets daily with on fixed hours and shared coms help i a a csm who plays the game daily while giving respect to the new players and the casual pvpers for 3 years now in the providence bloc being a part of building the current providence a region which sees medium sized skirmishes on a daily basis upholding nrds and turning the volition cult from 400 into ite current 1500  sizehave no mistake here in providence we see ourselves as the last bastion of the UFFFDnot red donUFFFDt shootUFFFD nrds policy in null as well as a truly neutral zone so for me and my voters this election alone was unique for provi as the year progressed so did we under attack by hero we dominated the news even which was scary for the state of null actually and we saw ccp change and eve with it i like too think that if the whole null sec was divided into 20 groups with 10 border wars null sec would be savedso just elected and i didnUFFFDt even have time to let it sink in as the work just piles up twitter account google docsdrive skype hundreds of emails not to mention the non disclosure agreement ndaUFFFDit is a bit overwhelming even if was on cloud nine as my wife even kind of congratulated me since this will have impact on my real life and my kids think i am the greatest even telling everyone at school a csm team where most are red to me ingame is funny to begin withcommunication is key so i set up twitter corebloodbro which i use frequently i am active on forums and other means of communication within my regio through open sessions on mumble eve email explodes sometimes internal csm forums all highly addictive for a eve junky with a rl and a jobin my evesterdam speech
got my vote again his year core good luck

he is my true bloodbrother i really hope we get the chance to work together on the csm 10
if i remember right there was some crying from him on the jump drivejump bridge changesi guess that counts as doing something
i will be voting for core again this year 
well hello theremy name is lanctharus onzo and i an one of the cohost and writers of the cap stable podcastin early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10here is our announcement
i think the most important thing isendie how do you feel about a compliant and subjugated scotland continuing as a card carrying member of the glorious united kingdom
i cant hear you over the sound of my shackles rattling
endie what is the single biggest threat to eve being placed on the game history junk pile let me direct your response a little so you get my mean is it perhaps the never ending how to fix null sec debate or is it simply new players not resubbing after their trial because they werent handled correctly
045
the csm are not game designers thing needs to be qualified with but they need to be very interested informed and articulate about the design of the gameccp have a pretty good track record of implementing things that some random blogger or poster dreamed up but they do tend to be resistant to csms pushing what ccp see as their pet projects thats far from the same thing as ccp being unwilling to listen to csms who have something to say about game issues though for instance i invested considerable effort in making the case of a pp nerf and while ccp werent much interested in my ideas on exact game design to solve the problem it was absolutely within our remit to highlight the issue explain in detail the secondary and tertiary effects and provide a quick response to the initial objections egpower projection allows massive events like the battle of br to take place and that was amazingly successful in recruiting new players why would we want to disable such a powerful marketing toolplayed right a ccp seat can allow you to have considerable influence on the future design of the game
anyway im gonna vote for you because i like your ideas on game design and i am confident youll be an effective advocate for them and with the talents i know you have im equally confident that youll also be a very valuable asset for the csm as a whole endorsed
endie is a good man and will be on my list seriously vote for this man he is the good stuff
you are spot on with the new players element we delayed our latest newbie drive because retention is absolutely vital to success as an alliance and that is no less true of the game as a whole we get jobs move into new houses get married have kids get promoted and more and gradually more and more of us drift away each year eve has a strong newbie hose but it it could retain customers like wow did it would be hugein games like wow there are designed timelines for new players and the first hour or so is all about feeding rewards to get people hooked the first level takes a few minutes then ding you get to advance you get your first new spell new items new abilities new zones and so on all carefull shaped around you as you progresseve doesnt do that as well yet for all that it is getting better with time and that doesnt even bring into consideration how key it is to get new players talking to and joining up with others a real core part of bnis success in retaining and motivating people and something that most highsec nonpvp corps just dont doits a sandbox though ccp can give us tools and we have been and should be pushing for better ones but it is also up to us i think that goons reddit bni and a few others do that really well and that the next big growth for eve will come when we can turn every br into thousands more retained players
what are your goals for the csm
i have removed some rule breaking poststhe rules4 personal attacks are prohibited commonly known as flaming personal attacks are posts that are designed to personally berate or insult another forum user posts of this nature are not beneficial to the community spirit that ccp promote and as such they will not be tolerated5 trolling is prohibited trolling is a defined as a post that is deliberately designed for the purpose of angering and insulting other players in an attempt to incite retaliation or an emotional response posts of this nature are disruptive often abusive and do not contribute to the sense of community that ccp promote7 discussion of real life religion and politics is prohibiteddiscussion of real life religion and politics is strictly prohibited on the eve online forums discussions of this nature often creates animosity between forum users due to real life political or military conflicts ccp promotes the growth of a gaming community where equality is at the forefront nationalist religious or political afiliations are not part of eve online and should not be part of discussion on the eve online forumsisd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls
my hope is to be able to influence ccp in the direction i have talked about on my blog an eve of smaller groups more frequent and more numerous wars fought between more localised actors i want to log into tmc or en24 or crossing zebras and see reports from a dozen wars spread across evethis may seem counterintuitive for someone who has helped build goonswarm into the dominant actor in one of the two largest blocs the game has ever seen but i feel passionately that an eve of smaller groups offers greater chances for more leaders more new fcs and more content creators that will be good for us for the rest of eve and for the game as a wholefor this reason i would like to try and influence ccp towards denser populations towards an eve that can see smaller groups stand alone and does not drive them into vast webs of neofeudal relationshipsi think that most players would love to be part of something more humansized in an eve where a bunch of plucky new players can decide to take the plunge and grab a piece of nullsec to call their own without renting without having to get the permission of one bloc and without bowing the knee to the other blocmost importantly i want to see it be extremely hard to remove an alliance from space as long as they keep turning up and defending it not just using it mind if someone doesnt defend their space however then it should not require multiple fleets and masses of supers to swiftly take it from them
how do you think a smaller eve would work with currently existing entities like bni and the cfc
will vote for you if you promise to post my music links into the csmccp skype channel
i hope that there is no need for the cfc at some point i think that a lot of alliances in the cfc and n3 huddle together because they know that by themselves under the current sov mechanics they are just targets to allow the big boys to have a merrie weeke of lowrisk entertainmentthats why i think counter to received wisdom that the new system should not make it easier to take sov people are risk averse and if you make it easier to take sov then you just get even bigger groups make it harder to take defended sov and the need for huge blocs reduces i dont think youd have mass resets the next week although pl showed the way on that with phoebe and are profitting by it  but i think that without fear you lose the major centripetal force that holds together otherwiseunstable blocshell in most mmos you cant hold a 50person guild together for a few months without drama and schism i want eve to return to that default state of human turmoil and dramaif you make it easier to take undefended sov but extremely hard to take defended sov then the pls and the bls get content  because people think it is worth keeping showing up for fights and that they are safe if they do so even if they lose but they also know that if they blueball or punt timers then they will swiftly lose what they have built upedit i just remembered you asked about bni i thin that they are in a huge group for two other reasons the first is that they actually want to be together because they have fun much like with red and blue the sandbox being what it is i think that is great and to be encouraged not artifically nerfedthe second is that kicking inactives on a grand scale is horrendous bni are not as vast as they look on paper huge as they are that is something for the csm to keep raising with ccp
this man literally changed my life with his exquisite musical taste
will you be using the philosophy and tactics you currently empower in the goon intelligence agency to the csm if elected
hello friendsmy name is bobmon you might know me from being the ceo of evenews24com i started playing eve online actively in 2010 i got into the game through a couple of friends at the time who ran their own dutch corp this corp was a member of a highsec alliance which at the time had an active wardec going on i had no chance fighting and so i got into spying and im proud to say that my first official task in eve was to spy upon my enemiesbetween these beginning days and now i did many things such as focusi think the most important job of being a csm member is to be a bridge between ccp and players as most as possible players are the one playing and their issues are the ones that need to be solved if i would have to list them it would probably come down toof course these are just some of my personal topics that i want to address but i am open to whatever comes at me to discusswhy do you wanna become a csm memberover this past year i have had a ton of everelated discussions with devs csm members and players and it made me realise that we as a community have a lot of great ideas i would love to focus these great ideas into actual small pieces for devs to take into account when working on projects i have also worked together with a lot of different types of players making me able to understand differences in how groups respond to ideas also i want to make sure that the player doesnt get forgotten in the whole development of eve change is foccused from top to button but through this mentality you forgot who actually play this game the players i want to make sure i represent those the players and nobody elseways to get to know me better1 feel free to ask me questions in this forum thread2 check out my twitter3 check out my past articles 4 check out bobs corner where i talk about stuff that interests me5 feel free to mail me at bobmonevegmailcom if you want to talkendorsement1 sion kumitomo2 tora bushido3 corebloodbrothers4 xander phoena5 endie6 manfred sideous
the bellow concepts are just ideas based on either ccp ideas or player feedback concept 1 hardcore player mode ccp rise talked about this a few weeks back and it got me interested i did some thinking and i liked the idea to have a special alt who is badass at doing pvp related stuff hardcore player mode in my opinion should be based on the pirate faction lines this would work because it would back up the fact that your char can always be shot even in highsec by all other players this char is special because once you unlock it you get a certain amount of sp that you can use on almost all pvp related skills with almost all i mean that i want to exclude every skill that doesnt require you to actually pvp in your ship such as no cloak and cloak related ships bombers probers no station skills no poss related skills only anchor maybethese pirate faction chars would only have the capability to fly their own pirate race ships maybe all pirate ships havent decided yet because they created these themselves to fight off their enemies the effect of them self designing their ships might result in a small extra bonus but again not sure on this yetpirate chars wont have access to wh space because their focus is to fight their true enemy the big four factions fleet wise i want these chars to basically be solo roaming UFFFDcross new eden but i do think that they should be able to group up with other pirates of their faction but this might result in them getting some drawbacks at forming fleets or whatever pirate chars should basically force a player to be on top of their game or they get killedpirates can maybe even make isk through killing people that do militia related stuff and i would love them to be these little pricks who cause a lot of chaos everywhere their golet me know what you guys think2 fix cyno turn pos shield on exploitthis is a exploit so lets thread it as one fix would be easy by simply adding cyno rules to anchored and onlining possescyno rules can be found here
you will be on my vote list bob
thanks you are on my list too
im ok with this
got my vote 1 3
i work for en24 and am not especially loyal to any organization so take this as you will i noticed bobmon has a lot of energy when it comes to eve hes loves this game of ours i think he is secretly in love with ccp guard but im not sure dont fire me but  one day we noticed themittani site was not updating news often enough and someone said it was because mittani had fired a lot of staff for i dont know for not towing the line or something embarrassing like that not saying it is true i dont know some of the guys suggested we write about that and on en24 because it is a real story bobmon refused it was a nonstarter to him that showed a lot of character and integrity the work environment at en24 is really good there is no pressure to choose a side or tow a line no hints dropped no performance pressure at all its pretty cool he pays well and on timehe obviously loves evelots of energy towards the communitygood relationships with ccpintegrityis a pretty cool boss
y no vote button where are u
i would like to know u more not

another pl 1 bobmon for csm
to your first question nah lets focus on spaceships shall we and im open to discuss things with whoever wants
i have met bobmon in evesterdam and we talk alot on skype he s very dedicated honest and a general nice guy in game as pl he s probably a awsome  spy as any eve pkayer can pick his attitudebob has the ability too listen and ask good qualities for a representive bob is enthousiatic when it comes to engaging players and runs eve24 almost solo on his dedicationi will ask my voters too put bobmon somewhere on their list and looking forward too work with him in csm10 hopefully
thanks core you have my vote too and i hope we indeed get to work together one day
bobmon owns
ive dealt with bobmon in the context of eve down under and always found him to be a dedicated and upstanding kind of guy 1eve down under  a community for players in the autz
i can live with this
vote yes on a pro rainbow csm candidate
oww zeon
inb4 ccp bobmon
good morning eve pilotsi can confirm that bobmon will be getting one of my votes this is because the guy is very passionate about eve and certain areas in particular which coincide with my own feelings and areas that i also feel strongly abouthaving worked with bobmon over the last few months i can confirm that he has a great sense of right and wrong and is a good overall bloke who devotes a lot of his time to eve and en24 never afraid to help new writers or content creators bobmon is an organisational mastermind as shown by en24 being a great portal for all your eve news and coercing writers and editors to do their jobs is like herding cats and i can only imagine what dealing with those psychotic pl dudes is like bobmon would make a great csm and i believe he has all the qualities to do a great job for the eve players and will not be afraid of asking the ccp devs the hard questions as a reporter is want to doi just hope he gets one of his en24 editors to check his statements before going to print as regular readers of en24 can probably can tell you his grasp of the english written language is tenuous at timesgood luck bobfly dangerous eve pilots omail liteen24 writereditor bl line member cfc spy oh wait forget that last one
what are your policies when you are in csm10 what are your plans for lowsec
i have always worked with the policy of if you say you will look into something then you better do it with this policy in mind i will focus on tasks handed to me until they are accomplished lowsec should be a place for people to develop how to pvp as a pilot and as a collective group the phoebe patch has been great because it now allowed smaller groups of pilots to harass the bigger guys im very happy with this because it means that lowsec groups get their hands on lowsec assets and over time this will result in lowsec vs losses instead of lowsec vs a blob of nullsec i do think we should look into how newer pilotscorpsalliance get into lowsec and make it more attractive for them to do so in my opinion it should be possible for these newer pilotscorpsalliances to basically open the map pick a system move there and make it their homes like you have in 00 in these new home they can make their isk grow as a group think of ways to protect your system and possibly expand system wise this will lead to conflicts that will result in an more active lowsec the ways of making isk should of course not be too easy and should have a sense of pvp attached so maybe the new burner missions are a great base to work out off now when a group gets too big in lowsec it should be in their interest to try and move to npc null or even try and poke at owned sovtd lr  basically make lowsec a good breeding place for pvp pilotscorpsalliances without making lowsec easierps i have probobly forgotten some things and i will add these over time in the reserved section
how do you expect to do what needs to be done on the csm if you cant even edit a blog site properly
why should npc nullsec and lowsec lead to the endgame of sov nullwhy shouldnt they be separate entities for people who dont want to be in the sov game
i dont usually reply to threads like this but i feel like i need give my personal endorsementi have cooperated with bobmon for a while as a guest writer on en24 and always found him available hard working and a willing listener to my opinions and ideas the fact that he puts up with my tardiness is reason enough for me to give him my support
a very hard workerbobmon would make a great csm member
lowsecnpc and such will all stay the same but it should purely be a optional grow path for an alliance to take more alliances will provide content and content is good
setting aside the tired high  low  null theme park design im going to focus on thisthis is true and it is a high sec concern because thats where new players wind up so do you have some ideas what are the pain points here how much of this is on the games tutorial offerings how much on official ccp helpers how much on other players how do corps and roles and poses help this hinder italso you leave out step 1 which is currently a matter of urgent concern to ccp how do new players find and join a corp in the first place
first steps roles and responsibilities arent clear was a summery of the tuckman theory to answer your questions though ccp is working on new and better tutorials and i think these will be great it will still remain very hard to let new players understand eve but it will help i dont have any problems with how highsec works because its safe and yet not too safe i would like to see though that highsec pushes more people in to pvp activitiesin my opinion players find corporations as soon as they figure out that eve is way more fun while playing with others i think its good that they sorta get thrown into the deep because it forces them to decide how their future looks my main concerns are related to how changes happen within this game usually they fix one issue but create 20 more jump fatigue for instance and i think that we need to look a bit more indepth to how things affect our game another issue i have is that ccp devs fix issues that they have never experienced themselves and this is really strange to me ccp devs should be allowed to play eve themselves in order to find really out what is wrong
ive known bob for a while now and his strong work ethic dedication and personality all speak to the quality of person he is hell be a great csm
fight a war vote for president drive a car have kids pay taxescant be on csmwhat kind of  program are ppl running in that frozen tundra of a countryd1 out1 bob for csm this message brought to you by the people for bobmon for csm 2015

this is true but not in areas that experience a lot off problems like capital warfare and such
well hello theremy name is lanctharus onzo and i an one of the cohost and writers of the cap stable podcastin early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10here is our announcement
good to hear that you have decided to run againas you are aware we at the cap stable podcast interviewed you during your run for csm9 and we wish to do the same this year for csm10here is our announcement
can you elaborate on your reasons for this proposal it seems to me that there are no advantages to this change in game mechanics only complications true newbies arent affected by awoxing they dont even know what it is nor have any assets of note to lose so they are unlikely to change their behaviour it only serves to protect highsec corporations by removing one of the few remaining risks to them good highsec corps interested in training new players already have systems background checks dedicated training corps etc to protect themselves so all this does is encourage lazy and clueless ceos to spam invites at new players riskfree and may result in more new players ending up in small lowquality corps run by equally clueless players this will make their first eve experience more frustrating than if they were recruited into a corp that demonstrated an understanding of game mechanics demanded to protect itself from awoxers who could teach them about the game and support them properlymore practically removing awoxing also makes highsec corp training and intracorp events more difficult and removes one of the few remaining tools that can drive conflict between highsec corporations in my view corporations should be meaningful and have value so players want to defend them  they should not be glorified chat channels with that value should come the responsibility of defending those corporations from threats both external wardecs and from within awoxing do you agree that a better solution might be to create a lowertier corp that is a glorified chat channel that is immune to wardecs and awoxing but that does not get the current benefits taxes poses etc of a player corp new players and riskadverse carebears can play there while players who want the increased rewards and challenges of running a full player corp can still do soin short what do you think a player corporation should be in eve
a few things to chew on im not going to pretend to offer answers frankly these are the sort of questions im happy to throw at space politicians tldr the problem isnt that there is riskwithout risk there is hardly any gameplay at all to logistics its just overheadbut that the gameplay options created by the current risks are lackingthat fearsome blaster catalyst is useless in any kind of engagement with a pvp fleet its a highly specialized fit with myopic guns blasters no prop and no tank which is where it reliably gets 600 dpsessentially its the shooty analog of the allcargoexpanded industrial if you see a pvp catalyst in say fw lowsec the odds are that it will have rail guns a prop mod and at the very least a damage control the reason this fit is at all attractive is the same reason the allexpandedcargoholdii nereus is attractive the odds that anyone will shoot at you before your ship has done its job are essentially nil tanking a ship that you intend to lose to concord is obviously stupid but its possible to fit a ship that way because its not at all easy to engage one of those ships before its pumping antimatter charge s into a freighter thats been bumped 250km off gate one reason if you shoot the cat before it shoots anything concord comes for youthe other big problem with logistics is that the reason most freighter pilots afk their ships is not only safety but well any person whos atk piloted zzzz a freigajgdklakfafasdmwhere was i oh right boring not only that but if youre caught youre helplessi think that as much as any real or perceived risk is what generates so much rage if you jump through a gate and land on grid with a bumping mach oh well youre not burning back to gate youre not mjding away youre not pulsing your mwd to evade the bump youre just sitting there indulging in what amounts to afk gameplay watching as control of your billionisk box is taken away from you just like thatthe generally proffered solutionaltsare a something of a plague already b only substituted by real people at a much higher scheduling difficulty and risk c about to become more of a hassle with freighter pilots having to duelrequest their webbing alts i wonder which will be the first ganker to duelrequest an obvious webbing pilot at just the right time to trick them into accepting the wrong duel can you even be in two duels at oncenow i have heard of alert freighter pilots realizing that they were incidentally aligning with a celestial and instawarping away it is possible for a freighter to get away from a bumper if the bumper accidentally points the freighter at a celestial or a safe and the pilot reacts in time but this is a bit like winning the lotteryincidentally its possible to afk bump turn on shiny mwd select freighter approach this does not produce anything like the results of an experienced atk bumper but it is possible especially once you have the freighter off grid from the gate and pointed far off the eclipticoutside of high sec bumping usually precedes o hai pandemic legion freighters are even more hapless at gates when theyre bubbled so afaik theyre bridged only slowboated through maximally lockeddown space i dont know sov nullsec so well and of course the idea of a convoy defending a freighter like so many other great ideas dies ignominiously in the face of fleet alpha and the lack of any lineofsight mechanics and outside of high sec you can bring much more expensive alpha if you choose to

thats the change talked about in csm minutes thats being discussed in this threadfrom my experience its because theyre stupid anyway so they dont have the correct information to give to the newbies and then the newbie either quits or leaves corp and spreads bad information causing a ripple effect of course there are some who learn otherwise but i dont see that much
which is why wardec nerfs are clearly up and comingi would much prefer ccp just introduce social only corps instead though trying to have the same unitcorporations as both a social community and a pvp group is the route of the issue
you obviously dont understand the concept of awoxing the entire reason to join a highsec corp for the express purpose of awoxing is members is so you can do so this is the important part here without concord intervention making intracorp combat cause concord to respond is in fact removing and prohibiting highsec awoxing turning it into another form of suicide ganking sure you could still gank the miners in a mining corp with a single character in the corp but ganking anything bigger would require getting multiple characters into the corp an unreasonable task for the ability to gank one or two mission runners
just like a cap ship before they could use gates getting stuck in a system with no station so too will sub cap ships get stuck on hisec gates with no fuel and no station to helpwar targets rejoice1
ehh 1afaik capacitor is our fuel and we have infinite energy producing machines
that idea is already in the game its called a jump portal generator
no its not try reading again
the removal of the corp on corp aggression hole in concord responses is something wed been talking to ccp about for a few months before the summit just to give you a little context and explain why there wasnt as much discussion on it as you might have expected for such a big changeim in general comfortable with the removal id prefer it to be able to be toggled with a delay maybe 12 hours  up to downtime and clear notification to current new and potential members but if thats not an option then i can live with it being removedgetting people into a corporation shouldnt have to be a pain in the ass a newbie being invited into a corporation isnt going to have spent time reading up on corp mechanics expecting them to have done it is naive a group of newbies running a corp because for example they came in as a group and want a flag of their own can be expected to have read up a bit more but the concord wont protect you isnt particularly clear anywherelong term im wanting to see fairly extensive changes to the social grouping systems of eve not just corp and alliance or the addition of corp lite but the ability to join cross corp social groups along with full discoverability for them one of the biggest problems at the moment being able to find spectre fleet for example and join it getting into a channel a mailing list bulletins fleet adverts and restrictions and possibly even having a small kitty for donations would be good sure its possible to do it with out of game tools but those suck for discoverability
steve is a rad dude he doesnUFFFDt indulge in the drama of the csm he works hard and he has great ideas he walks faster than anyone iUFFFDve ever met and is preternaturally calm iUFFFDve enjoyed this past year of working with him immensely and i encourage you to vote for him this year to return him to the council iUFFFDm pretty sure heUFFFDs a scottish ninja too
another one im delighted to see running again good luck and youll definitely be on my ballot d
all reps on fuzzy1
to be fair the same could be said for any elected body unfortunately those who run for almost any type of election unless appointed to do so by others and most times even then tend to be of the extremely selfimportant varietyfortunately the really important albeit rare qualifications for being a strong csm candidate are fairly simplethe ability to listen and comprehendthe ability to effectively communicate the thoughts of ones constituents in a comprehensible and cohesive mannerthe free time and desire to do the abovethe work ethic to follow through on the aforementioned desireso far i see 25 of that here
if only csm was what i pay my subs for i would vote for you but fortunately enough it isnt
thank you for your help
edit  i used your idea and added some changes see main post
well several of these are just straight up nerfs to ganking  something that is already pretty much unprofitable in all case except for overloaded haulers or blingfit missionerminers  i would like to ask more about this station lockout while i dont think it is feasible or fair as there is no precedent for a game mechanic where players are autoejected into space i am curious about your intentions here in your view would such a lockouteject system replace the 15 minute criminal timer or be in addition if i were an industrious ganker and had a bowhead full of gank ships in a safe spot could i keep gankingotherwise a 30 minute lockout where i all i can do is just sit in space in a pod is not very compelling gameplay i can think of several ideas that would actually make ganking more risky but all these suggestions do is make ganking less profitable and more tedious while doing nothing to give players a chance to actually get revenge on a ganker other than repeatedly blowing up an empty pod which come rhea podloss will have no penaltyfinally ganking is at an all time low yet suppose to be in the game do you really really think that more nerfs are in order
id say that the problem is that its too easy to mitigate risk with instawarps tacs docking and concord manipulation right now anyone who goes to the admittedly not insignificant trouble of prepping their active area and staying in fastaligning ships is essentially uncatchable oh sure a dedicated camp will catch them but not the randoms warping around in pve ships and indies nor generally the targetssorry this is terrible five minutes after this comes out anyone who cares will have a script running that detects that thing and triggers a keypress to dismiss it yeah thats a eula violation but that just means that youre encouraging people to violate the eula carrots not sticks how would you feel if you had to go afk because one of your kids acted upgot hurtwhatever and you came back to find yourself under attack tried to defend yourselfwarp off only to die because your keystrokes were consumed by a stupid modal dialog it would actually be better to do what some other games do and either publicly flag people as afk star trek online or just warn them a few minutes before logging them off elder scrolls onlinealso if you go afk in high sec for 20 minutes in your barge youre going to come back to a barge sitting idly in a belt doing nothingif youre lucky the sort of huge rocks you can chew on for 20 minutes tend to be in lower security spaceid strongly suggest finding and talking to miners before making assumptions about how they must want to play the gameyeah there are issues like the entire ancient rat ai system thats tangled up in the pos and drone code and the lack of any toolset for creating pve content which i understand is being fixed talk to sugar and mike if you want to get a better ideare different ways of supporting social communities in eve have you read any of mangala solaris suggestions along those lines eg
yes they are but thats much better then no ganking at all in highsec you need to see this not only from a ganker point but also from the ganked player it doesnt really matter how you call the timer as long as you are killable without the easy dockup option 30 minutes might be a bit to much 1520min or so might be better you should have docked up and ban the people who script i dont agree flagging is something different then what i want i want people to be behind their pc when they are logged in a notification a few minutes before you return to the login screen of course that should be therei havent but will do
tora has been my business partner as a merc for almost a yearhe never screw me over fine print despite hundreds of billions changed hands and trillions went boom whatever he promises you hell deliver
wow oksorry but if my kids in trouble im not going to do a damn thing in the game first and im not going to limit myself to those systems with stations either the issue isnt that omg i might lose space pixels the issue is that if i go afk i generally have a reason to and i have accepted that going afk in a pvp game means that i might well come back to a fresh clone in my medical station and i dont want to be nannied and babysat by some stupid modal dialog i would rather be logged outpeople go afk because a rational costbenefit analysis makes it a sensible choiceif you want it what incentive do you provide to encourage them to do that i mean if you did an honest assessment of exactly how much afk gameplay there is all over new eden it would be staggering and thats largely because of assumptions built into the core of the game you want people to be at their keyboards while sitting on a titan waiting for a bridge you want someone to atk pilot a freighter when the cost of sitting there glassyeyed for 45 minutes watching glacial aligns and slowmotion warp tunnels is not worth the smidgen of time saved and a tiny bit of extra safetyif you wanted to you could get rid of most afk gameplay easily remove autopilot the aggressive option for drones and module autorepeat remove orbit and keep at range and have approach turn off when your ship comes within 1km of the destination donedo you want to play that game
same here but then again i wouldnt cry about a lose or any game mechanic when i get shot when that happens you already have the same problem now in eve some clickable button wont make a difference yes to long afk while logged on in eve is bad we all have our interruptions while we play eve bio wife agro need a beer door bell phone etc but if they take to much time  auto log off
a couple of years ago i wrote a post urging a new perspective on the way we look at hisec here  id be interested in hearing your thoughts on how this meshes with your own ideasfakeedite huh that was actually almost 3 years ago sic transit gloria mundi
nah i actually dont there is no reason why game play that has been designed into the game that is highsec ganking should be made unplayable for no apparent reason gankers are suppose to exist the whole crimewatchsecurity statusconcord mechanism is designed so highsec criminals can operate thereuntanked overloaded and unprotected ships are suppose to explode that is part of the risk vs reward design of the game see ccp falcons commentsif you have some suggestions that make this game play more interesting  that is more challenging for gankers or more interesting in terms of revenge or whatever for gank targets i am more than eager to hear them or if you have some specific type of ganking you think is overpowered  perhaps you think freighters are too weak still and need a buff  then i will consider your arguments but if you are just going to say ganking  bad so we need less of it then at least propose a more fun mechanism than 30 minute lockouts something like turning off offensive modules in highsec so gankers can at least do something else then float helpless in a pod for 30 minutes aim higer tora try to make the game better i want to believe
you do realize that this doesnt increase pvp in any way as the gankers cant dock up to get new ships all this does is cut the number of ships that a single gank fleet can kill in half or require them to use extensive orcabowhead support ill send you a similar suggestion that i have for increasing conflict between gankers and antigankers we have already targeted gankers pocket books insurance changes and increased safety for minerstravelers bargefreighter ehp buffs in high sec enough further steps need to be taken to increase the interaction with those that oppose gankingfor the record i want antigankers to be more sucessful currently their job is exceedingly difficult but but making high sec safer is not a good option edit i just realized that i misread that your proposed penalties are only for people in npc corps that is fine but i dont understand why you want a reduction on loot drops blue loot should be the primary profit margin for antigankers and gankers already have to deal with the fact that they get no insurance on ships keep loot the same why dont you send these suggestions to james and see what he saysfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
first i was like who da frakk iz dat tora hisec scrub and then i was like ooooh marmites ceo and then i 1
anything that will increase the interaction between gankers and antigankers is something i will support blue loot would be ok too i mainly have an issue with freighter ganking right now its way to hard to protect yourself from it even if a freighter hires marmites to camp the entire system escort if from a to b its still easy to gank it mining barges can at least be pvp fitted as bait align etc
then maybe the randoms should set up dedicated camps instead of having ppl undock forcibly i think this has about zero chance of ever making it into the game though i just cant see ccp forcing players to undock afking ppl can afk what they want as far as im concerned it should be the players providing consequences to others being afk not the game undeccable corporations and remove npc meh thats substituting one crappy mechanic with another crappy mechanic dont nerf eve to death well it seems to me that is pretty much what you are advocating sir tora
dedicated camps against npc gankers good luck ccp can do anything even if they have to make you walk your fedo every day i am against things as afk mining or afk cloaking in nulsec good luck doing something about afk cloakers the biggest diff between npc and my way is that people can start to learn how corps work and group up the community thing is what makes eve such a great game
remember i am not going to run for csm x for just the tora ideas i want to listen to all sides and find common grounds if i would just listen to one side the game would be unbalanced and people will leave this great game i want content in eve fun interaction tears and profit keep all old players get more new players etc
you had my vote until i read this youre viewing ganking like a carebear as if the ganker is bad and the gankee andor whiteknight is good or some such nonsense it has nothing to do with whos bad and whos good its simply a playstyle furthermore why punish those who enjoy ganking again the buff to bargeexhumer hp wasnt enough the countless concord buffs removal of insurance fraud the buff to freighters the removal of blood jumping the rebalance to the bowhead the gankee literally having everything needed at their fingertips to avoid being ganked yet is too lazy to even f10 have you forgotten f10 star map  stars  statistics  ships destroyed in the last 1hr24hr do you really believe that highsec needs another buff as much as i agree with this and i do its just not going to happen going afk doesnt break any rules posed by ccp needless to say this would also effect everybody even those who dock in station to go afk making docking to go afk for a quick irl thing pointless might as well log off in space and maybe not wont log back in whoknows for those that have multiple accounts this would get old fast logging into a game shouldnt be a chore i am a little surprised to see you wanting a nerf to highsec wardec mechanics regardless i tend to agree that many new player corps get decced to death however as its been said several times before owning a corp is a privilege and not something that every player should jump right into without learning more about the game and thus the wardec mechanic helps as you put it delete the weak ceos and players who shouldnt be anywhere near owning a corpi made a corp a while back and was never decced i personally believe this comes back to the overall mentality of the corp the ceo and the players heshe invites or in other words if a corp gets decced they did something wrong and hey its not like they cant dropreform the corp for better or worse npc corpsagents will never be removed at least not anytime sooni fully support this idea
definitely gonna support tora for csm excellent
your thoughts about a 1 minute timer for people who steal loot  so they cant dock up right away
i can fully support tora as an intelligent alternative for the csm i would hope that he can help bring balance  everything does not need to be equal but a better balance would be awesome in particular  loot thieves need to have some delay posed on them before they can redock after going suspectwhen it come to high sec merc wars and the like he gets it and i benefit from all of his labors   tora tora tora
so lets review your idea of autoundocking as a ganker i would have an orca or bowhead in a safespot boarding ships from there if you think carebears or antigankers are gonna form up to scan down my pod warping from safe to safe and setting up you are sadly mistaken they dont camp stations now they dont set up traps in the belts now they dont figure out where my instaundocks are which are real easy only a couple of 100km from station in general sometimes even still on grid and in plain view for anyone to see if that may seem a bit sloppy to you it is its only because of there is no need for me to do any better atm so currently they dont hunt me despite knowing where i undock and dock knowing where i am going to strike ice fieldbelt with the poorly tanked miner thats how simple they have it atm if theyre not doing it now expecting that they will go through even more trouble scanning down a pod and hunting it while it warps between several safes is lets stay polite a bit naive at best it will only make catching a ganker harder and more tedious dunno about you but if i was hunting a ganker id be quite worn out the 10th time i scanned him down just to have him warp to his next safe the moment you land on grid and it will make ganking more tedious too so a loselose situation therebut lets say the do manage to catch me fat chance but in theory it is possible i get popped wake up in clone vat get ejected oh boy theyre gonna get some double revenge now ey o erm no at that point my pod will be empty thats a zero isk kill if they get me the second time haha but your clone cost haha well that problem will be gone in 6 days come rhea but maybe you missed the upcoming clone changes in short clones will be free come rhea zero isk paid so at that point i could not care less how many times i am podded and will be doing something else on my alts being afk till the timer wears off or simply logging off while getting ejected out of station every 40 seconds or so into the arms of an angry mob for 30 minutes although i think that mob will very soon get bored once they realize they are not ammounting to anything and will be ridiculed throughout the chat channels and forums shooting repetively at something that doesnt gain you anything will just make you look silly so this is what we will end up with gankers getting autoejected repeatedly out of station with just the odd passer by caring enough to lock and fire at them out of boredom or daftness gameplay none for neither of the parties involved and ridicule all around for ccp for implementing such a meaningless feature and the ppl shooting the pods claiming they are achieving something as for nondeccable corps they will come with nondeccable poses which will be filling up the entire space of high sec in a few months time with the deccable pos slowly dying out as it gets replaced by nondeccables they will also be a great place to hide for gankers who will most likely be exchanging passwords to hide in each others bases you could argue no setting up posses for the small corps but thats just pushing them further towards npc status again you would also be pissing off plenty of small corporations that currently run their own pos ive been in one that was under 10 we had our own pos taken from another small corp even and we were quite pleased with it not only will your highsec be filled with undeccable posses it will also be filled with undeccable bear corporations above 15 member bear corpos will simply disolve into several smaller ones and share a chat channel becuz of i just want to minemissionrun siteswhatever in peace to relaxargument your view on highsec is so aimed at making it a themepark with eve graphics that i seriously consider the possibility that you the ceo of one of the largest highsec pvp groups are trolling ps if trolling then all i can say is well played sir
hell why not let them have 15 minute autoeject from station timer too
ok then what changes would make an escort more useful to protect a freighter any ideas that could make even a small escort completely protect a freighter from a gank there are already some strategies you can use like ecm repping or webbing a freighter into warp but maybe there is something else that would be more usefuli agree people who go to the trouble of hiring an escortbringing friends should be much safer from a gank what additional game mechanics could we add to the game to make this happen
maybe you should stop crying about how bad things are in eve and start coming with solutions  it easy to shout from the sideline much harder to be constructive as i said before being a csm isnt about having all the answers to eve problems its listening to good ideas from the community finding common grounds filtering the ohhh everything is so badddd cries ignoring the trolls and trying to make things better in eve for all of ustldr  stop whining start being constructive
a self destruct module that is guaranteed to destroy all cargo and fittings if not afk then no profit for gankers
the funny thing is somehow youve come around mostly to my position auto log off is vastly preferable to stupid modal dialog boxesand i realize that im not voting for you to get your exact current ideas implemented im asking questions to see how you think because that mattersim not sure about noautorepeatever though maybe only some things can autorepeat i know that one of the attractions that this game has for me at my age and with my complete lack of experience in highadrenaline videogames is that it doesnt require twitch play its rts quality is appealing id want to find some middle ground between mashing f1 all the time because of the fast rof on small blasters and the setandforget rr sentry dominixre ganking i posted a thing in radu lupescus csm thread the relevant bit isall this is a way of asking whether the problem is actually the fact of high sec violence or the fact that it frequently breaks down to an actor absolutely controlling a target to the point where the target is effectively just an observerwhich is not compelling gameplay right this isnt just about putting high slots on freighters im not suggesting that its about looking at ways to take away that completely helpless feeling where possible

i was expecting tora to be a voice for competitive gameplay in highsecinstead we have selfinterest disguised as protecting newbies increased wardec fees are something marmites can afford but their smaller competition cannot so it will make them more hegemonic in predatory wardecs we have some of the most extreme suggestions for nerfing ganking that have been made by anyone not named veers belvar and we have no suggestions to teach newbies how to defend themselves from predatorsi retract my previous endorsement and apologize to the eve community for my poor judgement in having made it
does loyalanon know that
i will agree the intracorp aggression mechanics which can be used for awoxing are probably the least of the problems facing highsec corporations the real question is what do you view a corporation as is it just a clubhouse where friends can join up to form a social entity or are they game entity designed to compete with each other in all areas of space including highsec the game doesnt really know seem to know either as although there are some advantages to being in a player corp they are not persistent or unique at all all corps are the same so there is no real reason to defend them in the case of a wardecforgive this but here is an outline a better designed corporation system that respects risk vs rewardhave two tiers of corporations a protected corporation and a full corporation and a series of persistent deployables that can be reinforced and have to be defended like pocos the protected corporation enjoys full concord protection from wardecs and awoxing but has only minimal advantages chat channel corp contracts a few others the full corporation is as now with the ability to set up poses and these new deployables which will provided a distinct bonus to pve activities like mining and missioning this will allow players to tune their risk to match their capabilities and interest in defending their corplet me illustrate how it would work with a story1 lets say a relatively new player recruits some of his reallife friends and they want to make a go at starting a new mining corporation the set up a protected corp and start the business of setting up their mining operations recruiting and getting to know one another and their only risk is the odd suicide ganker after a month they decide to upgrade their corp to full status so they can deploy a compression array at a pos to make more profit on their activities2 a week later a rival corp in the system notices the asteroids are being depleted some words are exchanged and the rivals hire some mercenaries to wardec our new corp after a few losses the new corp realizes that they arent quite ready to defend their corp and decide to pull down their pos and surrender for a small isk cost and now immediately return to a protected corp status for an enforced minimum period of time two weeks they can carry on mining as before just without the advantages of the full corp3 a month later they have recovered and grown they are much larger have recruited some players with pvp experience and decide that to go to full corp again they set up a pos and decide to invest in some large permanent deployables to increase their mining yield in the system or cluster these cost several hundred million isk but provided a few percent bonus on their yield so they pay off in the medium term and therefore are a valuable and vulnerable corp asset now when some trashtalking leads to a wardec the corporation has a strong incentive to fight or hire mercenaries to defend these deployables or lose their investmentsomething like this could make wardecs meaningful and restore some risk vs reward to highsecsince this is your csm thread corbexx and highsec corporation mechanics arent in your primary wheelhouse as a wormholer i will stop here with this discussion of wardecs but i would encourage to extend your view of risk vs reward to highsec wardec mechanics if they come up for discussion on the csm as i just posted in sion kumitomos thread there is suppose to be risk in highsec and awoxing wardecs are a large part of that
hehe  i ll post a bigger post soon for now wintersummit yet even to come on the jb i guess i was vocal as i felt that interregional jb use versus intraregional makes a big diff where as the one is used to travel the null sec powrr projection highway and the other is used for your day to day null sec operations having said that i know wh low sec and npc null never had the luxury at all of having them the question if fatique and cooldown are where we want them as a evaluation i did send in indeed for the summit which i been invited too in jan

i am sugar kyle and i will be running for reelection to csm xduring the last year i have worked to repay the trust that you showed when you elected me and i believe that i have been successfuli promised to communicate i have i have written my weekly posts where i list what i am involved in and give my opinions and thoughts i have been running open qaUFFFDs where anyone who would like to come talk to me on neutral ground can do so i am available almost every day in my chatroom in game and i spend most evenings talking about eve in game through both evemail and email as well as twitter skype the forums and comms i attend eve events both local meets and larger gatherings such as eve vegasi promised to work i have iUFFFDve been an active member participating in meetings forum posts and skype chats with ccp i heavily participated in writing the minutes which we released to the public six weeks after the summer summit i have focused on quality of life improvements generated around pve some broken level v missions have been fixed suggestions like like warping your fleet to an escalation have been added i was also the push behind rebalancing escalations so that sites escalate through high sec low sec and null sec i have been active in the community collecting the feedback of the playerbase and taking that to ccp as major changes have been released one after anotheri promised to listen i have my time on the csm is about listening to the players and bringing that to the table many issues have multiple sides i may have my own opinion and those that i represent have another i will bring both of them with me there is no one way to look at eve and i believe that the voice of the players creates the soul of the game this position is as much about listening as it is about speaking i have been willing to listen to opinions and ideas that are contradictory to my own and been willing to accept and represent gameplay different from my owni came to csm9 on a platform to bring attention awareness and improvement with my focus on low sec i believe that has happened csm9 has taught me how to fight the good fight and bring things to ccp low sec is in a better place but that does not mean that it is perfect as ccp moves towards changes to null sec low sec will be affected and that effect must be accounted for the changes to power projection have changed the dynamic of low sec and we have to make sure that low sec remains the uniquely interesting place that it is my time on the csm has encouraged me to expand my knowledge of eve i may live in one area but i represent players from all over the game to me this position is about improving eve for all of us it is about preserving the unique things that the players make it is about bringing to ccp what eve means to its players and bridging the gap between development and what players have created npc null sec needs love as well sov null may be a major topic on the table but that does not mean other things cannot be improved along the waywe have challenges coming in 2015corporations alliances and starbases are on the table these are all areas close to my heart they are also areas where i have spent time and effort this last term collecting player input and opinion to give back to ccp as they revamp these important game mechanicsthere are so many things to do war decs need to be discussed and looked at against the future changes for corporations and structures markets and contracts need attention iUFFFDd love for boosters to get a serious rebalance as well pve has received attention and this needs to continue the entire pve experience needs to be improved and expanded in all sectors of space iUFFFDd love for there to be more dynamic and active ways to mine for those who wish to do industry in more dangerous areas of spacei am asking you to elect me againthe csm has made me appreciate and love this game more i have the time dedication and experience to help improve eve eve is what we make of it and i am here to with your help make it the fantastic place that we all want it to bemy csm9 candidacy thread
immediate 1 from me
1 from me sugars done a lot of good work on 9 and id hope shes elected to do the same on csm x
youve got my vote no questionsive found sugar to be open and provide thoughtful discussion and feedback when you engage her as a player additionally its clear from the csm summit minutes that she was bringing quite a bit to the table that were direct askers  request from the player base and that is appreciated biomassed  dust  eve podcast
i have been fortunate enough to meet sugar kyle on several occasions in real life as wellas talking to her in game although she is the lowsec candidate she has displayed a deep knowledge of every aspect of gameplay that i and other players could think to ask about she clearly understands and immerses herself in the community and approaches all game ideas and game related issues with an open mind and considers the positive and negative effects of all options on all parts of the gamea vote for sugar is a vote for a sweeter eve and q closer link between ccp and the playersas an eve podcaster for over three years i whole heartedly support sugar kyle for her bid for csm x
youll get my one accounts vote no question although ive been tuned out somewhat when it comes to csm stuff your presence and work in the community and ingame are apparent and impressive good luck in your run for csm10
i am delighted to see youre running again best of luck in the upcoming election youll definitely get my vote
sugar is the backbone of csm9 and i dont know what would we do without her csm 10 would be lucky to have her make it happen people
i supported sugar for her first csm run and she did not disappoint definitely a 1 from me
one of if not the hardest working csm members lowsec and eve in general is lucky to have her on the csm most definitely deserves to be on csm 10
1 from me sugars been a terrific csm member and not just for low sec residentsseriously if you love eve sugar should get your 1 slot on your ballot
sugar kyle has very obviously worked super hard to reinforce the csm as a whole as well as her own constituency issues even if you dont care a fig about losec you should still find a place for her on your preferences list because she makes the csm as a whole a more effective entityanalogy sugar kyle is a csm damage mod
hardest working most dedicated woman i know not even just in eveabsolutely worthy of your support1
10
absolutely need to have sugar on your ballot1 from memmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
sugar you mentioned upcoming changes to corporations and alliances i realize that much of the csm discussions are under nda but what can you tell us about your own feelings on where this should gofounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
sugar ive been reading your blog of course and appreciate the time you have taken from your busy csm life to support new players what would be the most urgent change to the new player experience that you would like to see pressed through
please elect sugar so the minutes keep getting done on time and i guess if you want someone to represent lowsec because shes great at that too but mostly because of the minutes
endie is awesome you should vote for him
cmon marlona just say it straightwill you sic digi on the other csm members
yeah i am standing not anyone else and i have nothing to do with counterintel if anyone from that side of eve runs then i am sure that they could quite reasonably expect to be asked about what they do and to answer for their decisions but to ask me about it in the hope that someone out there gets confused and thinks i play that side of the game would just be dogwhistle politicsim on good terms with plenty of people in hostile blocs and alliances one of whom has been good enough to post in this thread while others have been very generous on twitter about my decision to run and that is partly because they know my views on keeping what happens ingame ingame
at the end of the day he tries his hardest and is a likable guy1
1 to thisbob is a nice guygreat to work withcares a lot about the gamewill make a great csm member

counterintuitive mechanics are stupid people who push counterintuitive mechanics to support their favored playstyle at the expense of good sense are shortsighted and i continue to cringe at hisecs appropriation of the term awoxing as it is a noble and right pursuit born in 00a player corporation is whatever the players involved make of it some corps choose to engage in riskless ganking that abuses obtuse game mechanics thats what does it for them some would rather mine all day some would rather focus on tournaments theres no one right way to play as i covered extensively in my article on tmc linked in the op
i dont see how intracorp aggression mechanics are any more counterintuitive than the rest of the game mechanics especially in highsec it may have been implemented as a byproduct of the coding which allowed corponcorp interactions but has grown to serve a very real role in the training and culture intracorp sparring of many highsec corps removing it will be a headache especially for larger highsec entities who use it routinelywhat is next removing wardecs because it is unintuitive that when you join a new corporation that is in a war you might become a war target to someone else or remove suicide ganking because it is unintuitive that concord may not be able to save you all the timethese risks are what make the game interesting to play otherwise everyone will just fit max yieldcargo and are honestly the only significant nonconsensual risks to players in highsec although to be clear dying unexpectedly to a corpmate is probably at least an order of magnitude less frequent than the other two i agree there is no right way to play but there is a right way to design a sandbox game  and that is to implement at least some measure of risk vs reward balance across all activities if you want a 100 safe space for new players then just make one as part of a npe revamp with the appropriate levels of rewards but highsec is suppose to be a place with risk as ccp falcon has recently reminded us best of luck on your csm campaign
im not worried about the impacts on culture or training rvbs use case is entirely valid and while i share your concern there it also comes down to a comparative harms argument to that end mangala of rvb and i have gone over this extensively and were both confident that ccps planned implementation will be solid could that change sure its possible and time will tellas for the rest i dont own a set of skis so i try to stay off of the slippery slopes
hey everyonemy name is ambar khardula and i am running for a spot on csm x im currently a sophomore in eve university and i own evecastnet which is an up and coming blog network i am a seminewb having joined back in july of this year i found eve online through my best friend and partner and i immediately fell in love with it this is my first time doing something this big in the mmo world but not my first time in life i am running for csm x on the platform of accessibility open communication and the new player experiencefocus issue 1  accessibilityfocus issue 2  new player experiencewith all of this in mind i am asking for your support and assistance so i can become a member of csm x and represent new edens best interests if you would like to talk please send me an eve mail or email me at ambarkhardulagmailcomthanksambar khardulayou can also find this information on my blog the khardula chronicles
what other acessablity issues are there besides vision and how would you address themhow would you change the new player experience without losing the established base of playershave you discussed any of these issues with csm 9
hi dradisin response to your questionsin my experience other accessibility issues vary from vision to hearing and speaking ive read some threads on other forums about how mumble  teamspeak arent very accessible to those who having a hearing disability in the same way both platforms arent very open for those who have speech issues to address this i would suggest that when an fc gives commands over voice that someone in the fleetgroup is delegated to type the commands into the fleetgroup chatas far as changing the new player experience i wouldnt actually change the in game mechanics i would be interested in setting up an automatic eve mailemail to be sent to the new player when heshezey join the game in the message i would have a welcome list of resources list of new player friendly corporations and a link to the in game help chat channel in my opinion the in game mechanics are doing fine but it tends to be a bit difficult to know what do as you start out ive spoken to some new players who joined when they watched the recent this is eve advertisement and several had not played mmos before and others had only do so casuallyi have not discussed these issues with csm 9 i submitted a support ticket and was told about the chat and in space menu settings but nothing else seems to have come of thati hope this has answered your questions dradis thanks for asking
this seems impractical for large scale battles where time is an issue i would suggest a speech to text system ccp can adopt or for ccp to allow a 3rd party to make one available for eve integration not perfect but a step up
in my experience text to speech isnt reliable with all of the different accents talking speeds and background noise tts isnt the way to go i use text to speech with my smartphone all the time and im able to get what i want about 80 of the time but with this being brought up there can be discussions on how to address the issue
i appreciate that someone is keeping in mind accessibilty issues in eve that said what in game experiences do you have to draw on and what areas of eve do you feel qualified to talk about during csm discussionsfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
hiare there any particular aspects that you would like to see accentuated in the new player experience in order to prepare the new players for the reality of eveyou have any thoughts on the pve that eve offers at the moment
ive played a different mmo a cooperative gear grind type game one in which voice communication was universal among even casual endgame players alongside a person that was deaf accessibility issues are too often invisible in gaming but they are extremely important to community cohesionthe thing is despite wanting to make hearing or visually impaired people more welcome in games i simply dont know enough about the exact barriers these players face let alone appropriate solutions in the event that i am elected and you are not i will certainly solicit feedback from you on accessibility issues and take it to the csm
its possible to deal with this if only a part of all shares can be bought
id rather stay private
ccp seagull is correct about recruitment i disagree with the arguments that new players in highsec need to experience the risk of awox i also disagree though with being able to run highly profitable industrial corps in highsec without the same risk people outside highsec face for this reason i think corps should stay able to be wardecced and awoxedthe solution is as tear jar states to allow easier formation of groups and communities outside of the corporation mechanic while providing more incentives to be in a corp in order to keep them viable
deletedoops im dumb stupid wrongthread windows sorry kids72 can i avoid pvp completely no there are no systems or locations in new eden where pvp may be completely avoided eve new player guide

my closing statementthis is an interview look at the different people that are applying for this joball you need to ask yourself is this will this person try and help ccp in their efforts to make the game more balanced and think outside of the box for new and innovative ways to playif you vote for someone based on their alliance whether you like them personally or on some reputation as a player you will be doing eve a disservice and shooting yourself in the footthat is the essential problem with democracy incompetent people are winning elections based upon charisma and social connectionsyou deserve the csm group that you vote in to the jobsblah blah stuff followssimply put two over riding goals more good fights and less easy kills proportional representation on the csmthe mechanics are in favour of the attackers for example i suspect there has been no play testing to check the reactions of gate campers and miners when they stare at one object for a few hoursnull sec is far and away over represented due to having voting bloc people vote to represent their groups and personal interests i suggest we have one negative and one positive vote or alternative you can abstain one coalition can not down vote all the candidates that they do not like while the whole of eve can knock one candidate downwhether ideas are good or bad they can still generate new game concepts orca and rorqual minibubblepos shields absorb modules  auto dscan slower than manually clicking but saves your mouse and fingers worm hole love further consolidate null sec antiafk cloaking sov structure force recons become cloaky hunters getting veterans to break away and maybe take newbies with them from npc corps missions npc protection  contracts bounties and escorts mining discussion sov alternative  blobs and system performanceso on and so forthmiscas for how i handle things i do try to add a bit of humour to my stance probably fail a lot and if people are laughing it is probably at me but hey  laugher is still good for us allmy eve storyi have a dreamjenshae chiroptera wroteit seems you guys think i am shooting eve down being negative about it how about looking at it from this perspective i think eve is a fantastic game the fixes improvements and such that i am campaiging for are relatively small things in order to take what i feel is excellent toward perfection reaver glitterstim wrotejenshae chiroptera wrotei am not so much trying to stop ganking as i am trying to push for ways that the victims can counter ambush or stand up against the gankers instead of running add another layer to this aspect of game playsee now this is an idea i can get behind it has always bothered me that mining ships are so onesided they should be given the tools to fight back even if fitting for combat reduces their mining output thats a choice to let the player make not one that should be forced upon themyou know what id like to see on mining ships utility highs with unbonused missiles instead of or along with drones  and the beauty of unbonused launcher hardpoints is how easily you can instead fit a cloaking device probe launcher or capacitor mod in them i just feel that a big part of why miners feel powerless is because their ships are powerlessproc now  2x missile launchers possibly i need youif you do think that i or any other candidate will do a good job then it is your responsibility to inform people in your local corps and friend liststhere is nothing more effective at spreading an idea than word of mouth
i agreed with most of what you sayminers need a way to fight back if they are not afk and you have some good ideas on thati dont not like you cloak solutionsthe purpose of any recon and stealth is to get info on your enemies there should be a counter but fuel and timers arent the best solution i think to this problem i do think that cyno should be removed from everything smaller than a cruiser sb should not have that capabilityyour close to getting my vote

jenshaeas an old boss of mine used to quote to me many times democracy is the worst form of governmentexcept for all the othersyes democracy and the csm are far from perfect i agree history has shown however that the csm has been effective in stopping the abuses that spawn it so that can be seen as a winive been through some of the earlier posts that you referenced and find problems there as well you dont seem to offer any reasonable alternative to the csm and a few of your ideas such as making sure someone is qualified to be on the csm either dont work on the face of it or need to be far more developedyou may be right that large voting blocks control the csm but i am not convinced if however that is the case i think a reasonable stab at the situation might be to improve the apathy and misconceptions that the player base has about the csmwhat do you think alan mathison explorer  industrialist star tide industries
freedom of speech matters but ffs u are in my alliance lol your voice is your own ofc not mine nor provi blocgoodluck
if you can actually make that happen you have a heretofore undiscovered talent
thats the problemi would actually like to see a possibility of actively voting for no one so people can show that they are interested but cantdontwont support any current candidate
edit due to your decision to no longer run on the platform of abolishing the csm im forced to pull my support
while steve may still have some terrible ideas about afk cloakers lurking in his brain he has proved to punch way above his weight in value as expected based on some level of reading between the lines i dont think ccp would have gotten as far with crest this year as they have without steve there to provide the voice of the customer  in this case the data customersteve strikes me as a solid rational guy and his value to both the csm and ccp is pretty obvious after watching him for a year i already know hell be getting an endorsement from me when i get around to writing that poststeve deserves to get back on csm make sure hes on your listauthor of interstellar privateer shattered planets wormholes and game commentary
thanks to fill in a little detail about the first commenti dont like afk cloaking so i think there should be some counter gameplay to it not fuel or having to rehit the button thats dull and uninteresting something so that with time and effort you can hunt the cloaker an active one is safe enough as they can move and force people to restart
steveto be honest i dont know too much about your work on csm9 beyond your review of the first post here but knowing what has happened in the last six months since ive been a player indicates to me that youve been a solid advocate of things both in and out of just actual gameplay some of your ideas on pos and industry remain intriguingso id like to ask you some question which i know youve now seen that im asking of folks im seriously consideringspace has become littered with abandoned pos structures what is your position on getting rid of them id like to see perhaps a orbital degrading mechanic once the fuel is gone this then would open up the moons for pilots that will actually use them the current mechanic of course involves wardecing a possibly abandoned corp and then sitting there for an extended period of time blapping the structures i think something better is quite possibleeve seems to be popularly seen as more than a game perhaps moving into the hobby realm im aware that some discussions have been held with regard to finding a way to bring a more casual player or a more casual playstyle option into eve would you advocate this if so how might this be done without fundamentally changing the nature of the game would itit seems a given that csm x and ccp will look at dealing with the sovnull question this term beyond that from a gameplay perspective what would you advocate as the next priorityeve players seem to be quite passionate about the game yet it is said that the voting rate for csm elections is lower than that of even the united states midterms does this diminish the validity of the csm what would you like to do to combat the voter apathy that we see and effectively educate the voters on the reality of what the csm can effectively dofinally and most importantly do you like cats by the way your response to that last question in sugars thread well played sir well played thanks so much alan mathison explorer  industrialist star tide industries
if internal audit wouldnt object loudly then one could guess that ccp socksfour would have registered a cloud of characters or hacked the db just to vote for uncle stevie ccp has shown support for 3rd party support from very early on but in a bit of a backhand wayit has changed latelywith our 3rd party ninja on csm we can be sure that its not slipping back to that without a fight
some way to remove abandoned structures is certainly needed i suspect we wont see anything with the current system as it should be leaving relatively soon with teams working on a replacement if that timescale is too long ill certainly be advocating for something probably hacking related as thats an existing mechanic but with delays built in so its not forget to fuel my pos and its gone an hour later thats the kind of caveat that makes this more complicated to deal with for more casual players i do want to see better ways to draw them into the community things such as social groups like corps but across corps and not owning anything would help here its already possible to play eve casually but the bigger corporations tend to require activity levels other groups should helpnext things up publicly are corporations sovnull and structures theyre the big pain points for existing players however also on the go is the new player experience and thats very important having been spending time in rookie help i keep seeing the same questions coming up we have a list that suggests discoverability issues one of eves big problems if you ask me so the ui needs more work more hints and making things more obvious one example the links in pi arent immediately obvious how full they are adding a throb to them based on the capacity used makes it more obviouscombating voter apathy is a difficult thing to do weve been talking to ccp about it as for the validity thats a difficult thing to answer the people who vote tend to be the people most hooked into the community either personally or because theyre part of a group that told them it was a good idea so it does represent that kind of person id prefer bigger numbers which means a bigger mandate but ccp still find us useful yes i like cats grew up with a couple of them theyre gone now and my apartment doesnt allow for pets
such community dedication got my vote kitchen sink seriousy get your ship together  fleetupcom
i think you arent looking close enough i meet all those criteria and then some i am not an important player the whole point of eve is that anybody can potentially be anything the chaotic viscosity of eve as a sandbox allows for a nobody to rise to a higher purpose and then vanish into obscurity just as quickly
hi loreleiwhile doing other things and evolving as time goes on at this point i consider myself a hisec carebear as such your campaign is of interest to me i dont like ganking although i dont think it should be removed completely and i very much dont care for the content that organizations like code say they providehaving said all of that i do have some questions id like to askspace has become littered with abandoned pos structures what is your position on getting rid of them id like to see perhaps a orbital degrading mechanic once the fuel is gone this then would open up the moons for pilots that will actually use them the current mechanic of course involves wardecing a possibly abandoned corp and then sitting there for an extended period of time blapping the structures i think something better is quite possibleeve seems to be popularly seen as more than a game perhaps moving into the hobby realm im aware that some discussions have been held with regard to finding a way to bring a more casual player or a more casual playstyle option into eve would you advocate this if so how might this be done without fundamentally changing the nature of the game would itit seems a given that csm x and ccp will look at dealing with the sovnull question this term beyond that from a gameplay perspective what would you advocate as the next priorityeve players seem to be quite passionate about the game yet it is said that the voting rate for csm elections is lower than that of even the united states midterms does this diminish the validity of the csm what would you like to do to combat the voter apathy that we see and effectively educate the voters on the reality of what the csm can effectively dofinally and most importantly do you like cats thanks much alan mathison explorer  industrialist star tide industries
yep
im more interested in what tora has to say about wardeccs than about ganking right now my impression is that wardeccs are close to useless smart defenders just roll corp or stick to npc corps the only ones who actually fight are the ones run by egocentric ceos exploiting new players there is no punishment for just docking up and playing on alts for a week this makes wars effectively worthless in highsec do you have any proposals other than making it more expensive to wardecc small corps which is easily exploitable and doesnt really deal with how fundamentally useless wars are right now
stop being lazy and picking assumptions out of thin air just because they favor your argumenti know all of this oh and i dont even fly freighters myself i just know people who do but all youve done here is dodge the question first of all there are no guarantees even if you do everything right second you ignored where i said that alts are a plague any solution that relies on alts is lazy third what the hell use is a freighter that cant carry more than 500m isk and it doesnt matter anyway because empty freighters get blown upif youre not supposed to even fill them with ore theyve become useless and they should be removed from the gamethe riskreward is still offdespite your confident assertions afk freightering is still worth considering which if youre a csm candidate looking to reduce afk gameplay is not a good thing and the gameplay when things go wrong is still terrible
i had a productive conversation with tora today about ganking and it sounds like he is willing to consider counter points on this that said i am still trying to decide if i would vote for him or not please keep in mind that he specified that those restrictions would only apply to gankers in npc corps but it is obvious that he is not particularly familiar with ganking mechanics as they pertain to negative sec status gankers founder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
if he changes his platform to something more agreeable i will reassess my positionat present i feel his proposals are worse than the status quo and also heavily favor one specific style of highsec predatory prey the marmite model of a large coalition using wardecs to extort protection money and to harass nullbears that visit highsec at the expense of crippling others small wardec organisations forprofit ganking extortionbased ganking
thiscontrary to what someone else has said anybody that supports the idea of content generation and competetive gameplay in hs should not vote for tora
i dont think being afk is a problem in itself as long as players can mop up those who arent being careful
no out of principle
honestly i believe it would be a serious blow to the csm and the future of eve if somebody like tora were to secure a placei see that already you are suggesting serious nerfs to ganking and a token change to wardecs in the hope that no further changes will be made no doubt when in reality one of the biggest problems with wardecs is that its paying to gank without losses and groups like marmite are easily able to wardec hundreds of groups at a time devaluing the entire mechanic
1not too sure about your solutions but at least you acknowledge there is a problem with the interaction between gankees and the gankers passively tanking ships in order to prevent ganks is as dull as dishwater and places all the power with the gankers 
ive ragged on marmite before but i do have a lot of respect for tora and as such hell be getting vote
im not the one complaining about how bad things are in eve sir that seems to be your department in fact i think eve is in the best state in years currently but for your pleasure a less sarcastic reply on your idea of having a 1 minute or any lenght of time nondock timer for stealingas with your nondock timer for gankers the effect will be the same hiding in safespots but even easier as the looter will still be in his ship which will most probably be fitted with a cloak now warp to safe spot cloak scratch your nut sack 2 times and dock up even easier than sitting out the 1 minute timer after a gank which you cant do cloaked it will not add any opportunity to catch thieves that isnt already there it will not motivate ppl who arent willing to hunt thieves now to do so after your proposed change so again no gameplay added just made it a bit more tedious again for hi sec piratesthievesgankerswhatever you want to call them one step closer again to nerfing eve to deathnot only will no gameplay be added by this idea it will raise the threshhold for newer players to get into stuff like piracy to noobs that not yet have any understanding of safe spots instaundocks and docks a one minute no docking timer can look pretty off putting i can imagine your ideas on high sec criminal offenses fit nicely into the one more nerfcategory you say i want there to be ganking i want there to be stealing but its just to easy now so lets nerf it again after your ideas are implemented there will still be ganking and thieving and surprised by that the carebear community will once again ask for one more nerf continuing this cycle until hi sec criminal behavior is scrapped from the game mechanics or becomes so tedious hardly anyone bothers with it anymore effectively scrapping it from the game after that will come the whining about someone else mining your asteroid seriously ive seen miners complain about that numerous times in the chat channels shooting your mission rats running your site again complained about frequently in chats etc etc as for being a csm i dont expect any csm to have perfect ideas and answers to every percieved problem but if youre positioning yourself as hi sec candidate i do expect you to be in touch with the hi sec playerbase that includes hi sec criminals and have some vision on how ideas work out in practice which you seem to lack completely thats not me trying to insult you or defending my own ganking interests im just telling you how your ideas will affect the game not in a good manneras for freighter ganking how on earth is that too easy even with antitanked freighters you still need a sizeable fleet to take one out you cant just undock on your own saying think im gonna gank me a freighter to kill some time all by myself with just my 2 alts if it was that easy wed be seeing a lot more of it loot nerf so ppl wont gank for profit anymore well it might surprise you but contrary to popular carebear beliefs most ganks are not carried out for profit any profit is just gravy for moston ganking nerfs in general every time you make it harder to gank something the reaction from the ganking community will be the same more organized ganking the irony and more attention paid to weaker targets nerf freighter ganking more attention will go to smaller targets like mission runners miners industrials shuttles pods etc etc in general it will be more targeted at noobs too i myself have little problem with ganking noobs gank m while they are young so they learn early what eve is about and decreasing the chance they will become theme park minded carebears but you will be increasing the gap between older players who can fly tanked fast freighters and t2 tanked blockade runners and transports and the young who have little knowledge of damage mechanics and tanking and arent able to fly and fit stuff that will reduce their chance of being killed yet i think eve can do without anything else that will give more advantages to older players and will shaft the younger players in a nutshell i think your ideas are bad and not well thought out not bad as in well the core principle is good but we need to tweak the numbers a bit to keep it balanced no i think the core principle are bad for reasons i have stated
i vote no to all of the initial plans outlined on this platformganking in highsecsuicide ganking has been repeatedly nerfed again and again there is no need for further balancing as you suggest if people arent prepared to take simple steps to avoid being ganked or choose to auto pilot they have chosen to accept the risk to their assets im not sure what you think your suggested changes would accomplish what difference does it make whether a ganker is in an npc corp or not its not exactly difficult to make or join one not being able to dock or log off for 30 mins and being autoejected is also completely dumb they will not be in an expensive pod and they will not lose skill points soon so they couldnt care less they will simply minimise their client and die repeatedly until they can dock upalso how would you suggest they make ganked ships drop no more than 25 loot which by the way is not reducing gankingforprofit but removing it entirely why should any pilot in eve be able to reduce the loot he drops by simple refusing to engage back such as those caught in gate camps or pipe bombsthis section just comes across as a knee jerk grr gankers reactionafk for long timewhether someone is active when logged into the game or not is nothing to do with you if someone wants to afk mine that is their choice to make and they take the risks associated if someone is afk while cloaking they are not affecting you deal with it a slot machine mining game with a weekly lottery seriouslywar decsthe size of a corporation has nothing to do with its competency not sure why you think 50 members suddenly makes a difference war dec costs do not need to change not as long as it is so trivial to dodge a decsocial corp  npcno an undeccable corp is not something i would even entertain thinking about this undermines the whole concept of eveincursions and pveif you have been playing since 2010 then you should at least have some knowledge of the current issues with these topics this shows a lack of research to me i would expect a candidate to have some sort of grasp or plan no matter how vague rather than mail meindustrygrr gankersdreadswhy should dreads suddenly be exempt from the capital ban in high sec this wont generate more pos fights if a corp is going to defend their tower they will do so regardless of a dread being on fieldno offense but all of your suggestions comes across like the half thought out crap that you would expect to find in the features  ideas forum you dont seem to have any kind of solid understanding about any of the topics you want to change it comes off as more of a wish list rather than trying to make high sec better
i am not sure if the industrials in highsec or any sec would agree with you it seems its mainly code not willing to meet half way you know there are csms that want to completely remove ganking highsec  take your pick which one you want 100 gone or nerfed
as i stated before your core principles are bad for reasons stated its not a matter of tweaking them a bit and suddenly they will provide vibrant gameplay to all and be fairly balanced there are also csm members that want buffs to piracy in hi sec safe high sec candidates like yourself are also hardly new theyve been around since the start of the csm
not every csm candidate wants ganking gone or nerfed have you totally forgotten about the masses of people that just so happen to derive their daily content from the very activities that you wish to nerf or are you just ignorant towards them code lords of midnight countless individual miners that mine afk dozens upon dozens of small wardec corps that dont have the ability to bankroll 80 decs at a time need i go on in the best case scenario your ideas are bad in the worst case scenario the implementation of these ideas could lead to a scenario where the rich get richer sotospeak and the little guys continue to get sht on i see nothing wrong with the marmite business model as long as that model does not remain the only viable option for hs predation and it seems very clear that you wish it to become so in implementing these changes you could be taking away content from a lot of hs players effectively squashing a lot of your competition as the head of marmiteyou may say that you want these changes made out of a genuine concern for the wellbeing of hs but as long as yourea proposing changes that could work to your own personal advantageb head of the largest merc corp in the gamethen you wont get my vote simply out of principal not that i would have backed these ideas anyway so i restate my previous post anyone genuinely concerned in retaining a competitive dynamic hs should look elsewhere for csm because the changes proposed here largely benefit only one group of people large wardec corps that can easily afford an increase in dec fees who could easily field dreads in hs and who would benefit greatly from reduced competition
halfway to what you want to make criminal gameplay worse ie unfun for the purpose of reducing the number of people doing it this is not good game design if you want less gankingmore protection for industrialists you should argue for making ganking actually harder not just more tedious  something like buffing ehp reducing concord spawn time by half or something then at least criminals can still actually play the game as it was designedtrying to reduce players from participating in an activity that has been explicitly designed and built into the game from the beginning by making it undoablepainful is not particularly inspired your ideas should increase conflict andor player interaction not make it more boring for both the locked out ganker and the afk hauler they should make the game more fun ideally for everyone not punish people for following a career path that is there to make highsec more interesting and force game decisions of course industrialists dont like getting ganked but you should ask yourself if there was something that they can do to reasonably prevent it if there was not then you have a situation where a balance tweak might be needed or a new game mechanic implement if they die because they did nothing to protect their ship whether because they were new and didnt know how or were taking a calculated risk overloading a hauler going afk or whatever then that loss is working as intended now some carebears will go on about how ganking is too easy or no risk this of course isnt true and ultimately doesnt matter as the risk is suppose to be on the person pursuing the iskmaking activity but i will give you some ideas to make ganking more risky you can throw a bone to the carebear demographic you seem to be trying to court i dont necessary think they are at all good ideas but here they are1 implement a pirate hideout deployable that gankers can use as their base perhaps a small criminal timer reduction is the carrot to get them to use it that can be attacked2 vary concord response time so gankers are less able to judge when they have enough firepower for a successful gank3 add some uncertainty to the cargo scanner like there is for the ship scanner4 allow a mechanism where industrial ships can feed false information to gankers scanners at a fitting cost5 similarly allow a mechanism where an industrialist can increase concord response time by a small amount unknown to the ganker perhaps a module that looks like a mining yield enhancer to a scanner but doesnt do that  it actually decreases concord response time by 10 changes like these actually make the game more interesting while still allowing the criminal gameplay that is suppose to exist in highsec punishing criminals with longer lockouts or less loot does not however ultimately ganking is going to always appear to be in the advantage of the ganker as you normally only seehear from the gank victims not the 99 who the ganker passed over because they were properly tanked or were never seen in the first place because they used scoutsinteldscanbookmarks to stay out of the crosshairs this of course is the role of the ganker in the design of eve  to incentivize players to spend the time and effort to protect themselves  which really is a key part of this game eve without suicide ganking would be much less interesting  everyone in highsec would use the same max yieldcargo fits and afk everywhere tora be a voice to make the game better and dont pander to those who would make the game less interesting in the pursuit of their selfinterest
tora what is your opinion on the different proposals that have been floated over time that have suggested incentives for the defender in war decs to mount an actual defense it seems a common complaint is that defenders in war decs dont have any reason to really defend leading to a decrease in overall pvp what would be your take on an incentive if in favor
the problem with this line of logic is that it doesnt apply consistently enough to matter remember that guy whod been ganked running a purplefit raven navy issue in a soe system and he was so furious because hed been doing it without issue for five yearshed been doing it wrong pretty much every day for five years without interruption you have to agree that in terms of consequences this kind of wrong is hard to distinguish from doing it right once in five years flying a blingmobile in a gank beacon of a system consistently would lead you to believe that he was incredibly careful but he wasnt he was oblivious and five years of successfully being oblivious had led him to believe by induction that he was doing it right can you blame himthis is also most of the freighter pilots in the game i knew guysnot newbies by any stretch of the imagination but guys whod been in atlas back in the daywho would set freighters to afk autopilot through high sec and then go to bed nothing ever happened so can you really say in terms of the lessons the game actually teaches that afk autopiloting a freighter is wrong is it actually smart to invest money in an alt and time in training and extra attention to flinging your hauler sideways through systems with a dubious mechanical side effect for what amounts to a marginal increase in safety is it smarter than setting autopilot on the thing figuring that its nbd if it gets there 10 minutes later and going off to fly a ship thats actually fun to fly or just going to bedin effect and regardless of the intentions of the gankers ganks are generally processed by freighter pilots and mission runners as playerprecipitated lightning strikes and theyre right because the true safety in high sec is in numbers
vegas mirage should be back pretty soon im sure he will vote for you bro 
everything in eve as in life is a calculated risk rl research has shown that people have an accepted level of risk that theyre subconsciously willing to take on a daytoday basis its why people drive without their seatbelts on text while theyre driving dont put winter tires on their vehicle or partake in any number of other activities with an associated risk without taking every possible precaution to ensure their total safety while doing so to say that an experienced afking freighter pilot chooses to afk because he genuinely thinks that hes safe is wrong rather he knows that theres a risk however small that risk may be but that hes choosing to take the calculated risk of afking with the knowledge that while he may be ganked the odds are in his favor that he wont behes entitled to take that calculated risk just as the gankers are entitled to take advantage of any oversights he may make just like anybody else that gets in an accident after rolling through an intersection due to not having winter tires on their car hell be pissed off that he lost his ship but that doesnt change the fact that he took a knowing calculated risk he could have taken steps to avoid the loss but he didnt ive done a lot of freighter hauling in my time and the only time ive ever lost a hauler a t1 hauler at that was the day i was awoxed bringing fuel to my pos since then ive stopped autopiloting my haulers and you wouldnt believe the difference that makes if someone isnt going to spend the time to make sure that their ship arrives safely at the destination then i have no problem separating him from his ship as its clearly not worth his time anyway
while its clear that only code members oppose tora let me explain why the eject from station feature would be great despite being rationally useless empty pod no clone costsmost ganks are done for tears if everyone would just shrug and replace the losses code would be disbanded in a week but we know that eve is full of people who cry a river for losing a 05 retriever they do so in impotency they dont know anything of pvp and have no idea how could they defend themselves all they experience that some veteran just came out of the blue and destroyed something that was theirs and they have no clue how did it happen this is why i linked a why was i ganked guide to every target i ganked and surprise i barely got tears despite i popped 124140b of miners in two months before i got boredthe eject feature would give them the chance to fight back they could fly to the station and shoot the big bad ganker sure it would make no sense but hey ganking a venture makes no sense and code had a competition for it the guy would get revenge the thrill of winning in pvp he might even try again against a ship and before hed notice hed be flying in lowsec looking for fightsthe point isnt to remove ganking its to remove the i cant do anything against these gankers feeling from the carebears give them a symbolic chance to hit backedit there is a way to improve it instead of making the gcc longer keep it just 15 mins but reset it to 15 mins whenever the ganker is podded so antigankers could stop a ganker by repeatedly podding him so they could fight back meaningfully and force the bad criminal to run and hide
yes my point exactly i used the mission runner as an example of how you can do this for so long that you dont even know there are risks the point of establishing that the freighter pilots were nullsec veterans is that they knew exactly what the risks were and they still did it and their calculations were accurate enough that they had no incentive to change their behaviori personally have railed against autopilot i hate it and i dont use it but then i dont fly freighters either if afk autopiloting freighters is the norm then its what makes sense to most people and i know enough veterans who do it to believe that its the result of a rational riskreward calculation combined with the fact that if the freighter is attacked oh wellno benefit to being atk for that either so the obvious conclusion is that high sec freighter logistics naturally and rationally gravitates toward afk gameplay and if youre concerned about that thats the place to look ganking has just about nothing to do with it
you couldnt be more wrong here tora we just dont see nerfs to ganking as providing any productive solution make life easier and more exciting for white knights ganking will suffer slightly but in ways that make everything more exciting for everyone involved take a look at the proposal put forward by bebop and know that i think its a wonderful idea that would provide a better chance for players to fight back against ganking make ganking more interesting and exciting and make eve a more dangerous place instead of your proposal to make it safer sabriz for csmx a vote for tora is a vote for theme park high sec
ive been part of code for two weeks i havent ganked a single ship in my life and if i was gone tomorrow bad ideas would still be bad ideas it has nothing to do with bias or politics i live in hs because i enjoy the targetplayerrich environment tora wants to bring safety to hs and i oppose it it contradicts everything that eve stands for
killing an implantless clone that the ganker pays nothing for doesnt really count as revenge pod killing is about to become laughably irrelevant and anyone who will brag about killing someones pod will be made fun of incessantly the loot drop change would not reduce ganking for profit it will remove it from the game except in the most extreme circumstances like a jf full of plexi dont see how this would increase player interactions or make eve a better game for anyone currently the only thing that can be ganked for profit with any kind of reliability is freighters and jfs being flown by people so are so sure of their safety that they pack them full of more isk than they should by any stretch of the imagination all this change will do is protect fools from the foolishness of their actions if you think freighters and jfs are too easy to gank well thats a different issue but hitting ganking as a whole square in the jaw with a nerf bat is a pretty terrible way of dealing with it the popup idea is one of the worst ive ever seen the slot machine game while mining weird but i think i see where youre trying to go with it and maybe something different can achieve the same goals increase player interactivity while mining without coming across as arbitrary features personally i hate slot machines and slot machine style games and would ignore such a feature altogether im sorry tora but this comes across as a thinly veiled attempt to destroy your competition in the war dec aspect of eve i dont know why you think this is a good idea but maybe if you can explain ill change my mind this is especially terrible while it remains so stupidly simple to simple ignore a war dec by closing corp and reforming how many of these corps that you are claiming are killed by war decs are reformed minutes or hours later under a new name this fixes nothing and wrecks a lot of things im not entirely against this as it does encourage player interaction which is always positive even when its destructive npc corps will never completely go away as mechanically you need a place for players to go when they leave a player corp you say this and yet it seems to be the direction your suggestions leadsorry tora but if your position on some of these topics remains as it currently seems to be i do not want you representing me on the csm i love you but i cannot vote for you in good conscience whatever happened to delete the weak you may need to change your signature to protect the weaksabriz for csmx a vote for tora is a vote for theme park high sec
im not a code member i in fact have an incredible dislike for code and i oppose tora by the way literally anything that comes from your mouth will be detrimental to toras campaignexcept they wouldnt go to the station and fight for starters they would have just been ganked and potentially podded by the time a nonpvp pilot kits up a pvp ship and heads out to the ganker the ganker would be long gonesecondly the ganker once podded could be anywhere the gankee would need to track them down in order to fight back which would take longer than they would be on a timerthirdly killing them would be pointless they would undoubtedly be in an empty clone so you could pod them over and over again and they wouldnt care bear in mind that by the time this were implemented clone upgrades would be long gone so they wouldnt even lose spexcept a ganker would only need to escape once then youd never catch the pod even if he was terrible and couldnt escape he could just log on different character and continue to gank
well almost the ganking is really the only threat facing the afk pilot if ganking freighters is made more difficult this choice will be made even more obvious every single freighter in hs would be afk all the time this isnt good for anyone rather than attacking ganking i would say find ways to encourage players to be at their keyboards in ways that would protect them if a gank attempt were to occursabriz for csmx a vote for tora is a vote for theme park high sec
im sure industrialists in high sec are more likely to push against wardecs from people like you who farm noncombat targets for killboard efficiency than gankers who they have a fraction of a chance of being ganked by if they happen to carry too much in the wrong placeyoure really running the wrong group if youre trying to win over the highsec nonpvp vote
i have removed a rule breaking post and those quoting it as always i let some edge cases stayplease people keep it on topic and above all civilthe rules4 personal attacks are prohibited commonly known as flaming personal attacks are posts that are designed to personally berate or insult another forum user posts of this nature are not beneficial to the community spirit that ccp promote and as such they will not be toleratedisd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls
i believe were in violent agreement and its not enough of a threat to keep people from gravitating toward the direction that the intrinsic gameplay of freighter piloting encourages which is to set forget and go do something else some people even remember to keep the value of their cargo down i dont have a strong opinion about people being afk for whatever reason but it seems to me like the intrinsic gameplay shouldnt encourage it especially when theres realtime ongrid conflict between playersi also think that a lot of the problem goes way deeper to the fact that theres very little incidental socialization in eve except for local and lol constellation all chat channels and certainly all voice comms are little walled gardens even the public chat channels are almost impossible to find until someone tells you about them and then you have to remember the name so were at a point now where there are two camps and each has a contemptuous opinion of the other and each one doubles down on their position in response to any criticism there are exceptions of course but not enough of them if there is any medium of communication between strangers its text which is famously bad at communicating tone and intenti mean think about it wouldnt it be the most obvious thing to be able to easily communicate with other ships on grid and we can clumsily with technology that dates back to the 1970s doesnt that seem odd he says in a csm candidacy thread 
so should ganking become even more common then
yeah i agree with everything youve said here unfortunately im not sure how you could make freight hauling more interesting without inadvertently giving freighters a massive unfair buff
i just spoke with tora regarding this pressing issue he should be along any minute now to explain how a random popup every 3060 seconds will both keep peoples attention at the keyboard while also increasing the fun factor lest the autopiloting ships engines shut off should you fail to press the button before the timer expires
reallyjust to pick one tiny little incremental example ccp could do to freighters exactly what they just did to sov structures less raw hp more resists except that the resists would come in the optional form of enough cpu to fit a basic damage control and some kind of hull tank or resist platingjust like that afk freighter piloting becomes more perilous and active freighter pilotingalbeit for a de minimus and inadequate definition of activeis rewarded but the ehp of a max tanked freighter hasnt changed substantiallynow im not saying that that in itself is a good change you get to activate a module every few minutes to avoid painting a huge target on your back is not compelling gameplay in and of itself its just an offthecuff example of the sort of change you could make without turning freighters into indestructible fortresses a package of similarly balanced changes could redefine the classwith that said if the poster back a few pages is right and the ceiling above which a freighter gank is profitable has dropped to only 500m isk maybe a slight buff is appropriate you should at the very least be able to fill a freighter with common high sec ore without drawing too much attention to yourself otherwise what are they for
assumptions out of thin air these carebear tested ganker approved tactics that work coming from an active ganker sir just because your commenting on something you obviously know nothing about doesnt mean youre right it actually makes you look a bit silly if you or any other player wants to ignore these helpful tactics that significantly increases your risk of losing that shiny freighter you seem to love oh so much and then its your fault for losing the freighter to begin withthe generally rule is dont carry anything worth more than your hull this more of pertains to freighters or ships that are terrible with alignment and cant covops if you want to carry 2bisk over what your freighter costs great youll be a target if you want to be smart about it and not carry cargo worth more than your hull then obviously your chance of becoming a gank target decreases i shouldnt have to spell this out for you i dont know what game youve been playing the past year but it wasnt eve onlineomg an empty frieghter died that means all empty freighters die thats some nice logic you have there too bad its wrong an empty freighter only becomes a target if and when there are no other targets they are never primaryyou had a question seemed like a statement to me ill go ahead and answer your questions for you now1 no guarantees welcome to eve2 who said anything about alts oh you did i dont know why youre hellbent on some alts they come in handy if someone doesnt have an alt then ask a friendcorpmate3 see aboveanything else
as so often you are wrong i do not gank for tears i gank simply for the kill its the hunt that motivates me can i be stealthy enough to scan him get a warp in on him and land on top of him before he suspects any trouble in general tears bore me as most of the time they are just waaaah waaah y u keel mi go suuk dik as for your improvement the work around i would use for that train up more alts mostly tradingindustrial alts that arent doing anything outside of stations anyway atm log out your first ganker have it autoeject till hell freezes over log back into another alt gank on that rinse repeat other work arounds set you medical clone to a low sec station no bear will dare venture there have a jump clone in hi sec id most likely be combining the two end result no gameplay added for gankers no gameplay added for antigankers the fact that you think repeatedly shooting autoejecting pods is gameplay kinda surpises me tbh it sounds like a chore more than it sounds like gameplay im sure that anyone who has been doing it for more than 20 minutes will agree youll get chats like thishey guys i wont be going on mining opsmissioningroamingincursionswhatever cuz i got ganker poddingduty today have fun without me while i am out here making sure that just 1 ganker gets locked down while he is logging in on one of his 10 other gank chars and continues to gank sounds really appealing to all parties involved yeah you wrote your guide on antiganking which is pretty decent i still link it to ppl sometimes if they really seem to have no clue so you know how easy it is to avoid ganks yet here you are advocating one more nerf i am disappoint gobbles i am disappoint
i am against it as a small corp or alliance would never ever be able to defend against a large nullsec alliance any more and if you do it then you need to do it in low and null too where you also have npc stations
still no we need a content creator not a merc blue donut makerwe need someone has pvp experience not t3 blob gang with neutral logi altswe dont need a mermaidcoward for csm
my personal opinion is to have some form of hacking that can be used to unanchor offline towers varying in difficulty on two things 1 size easy for small towers hard for large towers 2 type of tower easy for a basic amarr tower hard for a true sansha towerthis could use the hacking skill or a new one but would allow for people to go out and find and remove these towers
i would be happier with locking mechanisms that used grid and cpu so that if you wanted to have a seriously lockeddown small tower you could as long as you paid the cost for it
corbexxthanks so muchill take this opportunity to ask the other things ill be asking candidates im taking seriouslyeve seems to be popularly seen as more than a game perhaps moving into the hobby realm im aware that some discussions have been held with regard to finding a way to bring a more casual player or a more casual playstyle option into eve would you advocate this if so how might this be done without fundamentally changing the nature of the game would itit seems a given that csm x and ccp will look at dealing with the sovnull question this term beyond that from a gameplay perspective what would you advocate as the next priorityeve players seem to be quite passionate about the game yet it is said that the voting rate for csm elections is lower than that of even the united states midterms does this diminish the validity of the csm what would you like to do to combat the voter apathy that we see and effectively educate the voters on the reality of what the csm can effectively dofinally and most importantly do you like cats  alan mathison explorer  industrialist star tide industries
yes i would im all in favour of a corp lite social groups exactly what it would get or have not surewe dont really get a say in priority but i will say ill be carrying on working on stuff i think would help wspace being proactive going out finding issues getting info on it and passing it on to ccp allows you to potentially get alot sorted even if it is just little quality of life stuff obviously if i had my say it would be wspace but to be honest wspace is doing pretty well with small iterations there is still stuff to do but its not like null that needs a huge revamp alot is knowing just who to go toit was down there is probably alot of reasons not enough advertising the fact that csm 8 was fairly quite with no huge rage monsters for people to go emo about i dont think it diminishes the validity of the csm its not ideal ill give you that but id like to think most of us have justified our spots how to improve this i think needs both the csm and ccp pushing it to peopleyes
ccp has come out and stated that they want dotlanstyle functionality for the gorgeous new map which is awesome for kspacewhats your stance on their building in mapperstyle functionality for wspace
i want to add one more thing i think i can bring to csmim the sort of person that is always looking for loopholes through which you can scam people when retribution was being discussed i found two exploits that could be used to abuse the new bounty system i reported both to gms without using them and as a result one was fixed immediately the other ccp had already discovered and had included code that prevented it workingwith the forthcoming rhea release ive been speaking up about some of the potential issues with the corporation recruitment changes and ive been one of the people responsible for getting the 6 invites per minute restriction added there are still loopholes in this system but they likely fit the limits of acceptable scam not exploit and so im seeking clarification on this nowas a csm member id be in a better position to detect possible exploitable holes in new systems before they go live and clarify with ccp whether they are bugs features or unintended but acceptable loopholes
conflict drives evemost of eve is concentrated in hisecsabriz i am confident you will carry this very important torch to ccps doorstepbye now 3
i appreciate that the whole james aged 13 and a bit code thing is role playing but to me it is just well weirdi would not vote for you for the simple reason that by being a james acolyte you lack the ability to see past his massive ego
youre welcome to your opinion we arent roleplayers noone on code teamspeak during freighter suppression operations talks in character at allif youve got questions related to my vision of what highsec should be and how it should interact with the rest of the eve universe  even hostile ones  feel free to ask them in this thread my support for james 315 is limited to generally agreeing with his views on these questions  i dont know him irl at all
hey man youve got my vote my incursus and my ishkur its good to see someone fighting to keep the content alive see you in corp o7
walls of text that i didnt bother to read for this i will not endorse you
starting off a csm campaign with a philosophy that is fundamentally wrong and undermines the fact that a variety of people play for a variety of reasons is not really a good start while you refuse to accept them as players there are many players who do simply play without engaging others who are quite happy scanning down and running sites with no interaction with other players while im a strong believer in player interaction being a core focus of eve id not consider players who do not enjoy that part of the game to be irrelevant in any way if someone wants to log on and run missions all day long not talking to or interacting with any other players they are welcome to do soand id generally avoid voting for a member of a group which either by design or through ineptitude supports botters the csm infected by new order ideals is certainly not the future vision of eveid question what changes it is youd actually strive for in ganking and wardecs since its implied that youd be looking to make both easier which is pretty much the opposite of being newbie friendly its also interesting how you refer to the carebears while you are part of a group which engages in low cost minimal risk pvp and no the fact that you lose a cheap ships is not a risk its a cost against targets which you pick specifically for their lack of ability to retaliate its even going to become even lower risk with clone upgrade costs not being required youll now be able to use higher sp characters without needing to warp them out and not even worry about paying to upgrade the clonepersonally i dont trust you to put the needs of the playerbase before your own personal agenda
words are scary things thanks for bumping the thread though
you claim that eve is all about conflict but selflessly give your time and knowledge to new playersplease explain this obvious incoherencydo you agree that highsec ganking is an almost riskfree activity given that being concorded is simply a game mechanic it is about as risky as clicking trash it on a menu choice if not please describe the risks faced by a gankeryou state that reward should be aligned to risk do you feel that the rewards of ganking are at an appropriate level given the risks that you discussed above
to expand on my previous postas a fellow regular in the ncqa subforum i can attest that sabriz is a very smart individual with a grasp on the game that extends far beyond code shes very honest about her playstyle and always gives out good advice to new players on how to avoid becoming prey to gankers i wouldnt touch her with a ten foot pole ingame but im convinced shes actually interested its wellbeing code is just one of the many facets to sabrizi have no special love for code but i will be voting for sabriz as an individual who appreciates the freedom of expression we have in new eden and who i believe will protect that essential element of gameplaywant to talk join my channel in game house forelli
great a player who knows eve and helps newbies that alone does not make a good candidate for the csm a csm member you have to trust to put the needs to the overall playerbase before their own agenda i dont trust sabriz to do that
i wont muck up her thread with an argument but i would encourage you to read through her posting history  particularly in ncqa and market discussions  before you write her off as a simple ganker i feel her expertise in market economics and deep understanding of ship stat balancing are great traits for a csm candidate you are of course entitled to your own opinionwant to talk join my channel in game house forelli
im not writing her off as a simple ganker im writing her off as someone with knowledge of the game who is willing to help out new players but who i wouldnt trust with the responsibility of taking the needs of other player groups seriously already in her campaign outline shes decided that nobody plays without expressly wanting conflict which is obviously false and puts across the impression that players who seek to play without conflict are irrelevant from what ive read in the past id be very surprised if any players who did not confirm to her ideas of how to play would be considered relevant a csm members has a duty to put that aside while they should have their own thoughts and opinions derived from their own experiences we should be able to trust them to look beyond that and consider the whole playerbasei wouldnt trust her to do that is her membership of code part of that sure it takes a certain type of person to support code a type of person who i wouldnt trust to make selfless decisions or consider other people feelings but thats not the only or even the majority factor im not a newbie here and ive seen enough sabriz posts to have a fairly idea of her thoughts on the direction of eve
sabrizill start this off on the wrong foot but please read it through i hate code i think theyre extortionist griefers and it is only because eve is the sandbox that it is that i dont think they should be banned entirely they say they produce content and in fairness they certainly do but it is not the kind of content that i care to participate inhaving said that despite much of my heart railing against this your thread here has shown you to be a thoughtful person i think with some very intriguing ideas complex and nuanced enough so that my hearts argument of shes just a code griefer ignore her just isnt fair and wont wash so despite your background i find myself following you and seriously considering youhows that for a ringing endorsement as such id like to post to you some questions im asking the candidates that im seriously consideringspace has become littered with abandoned pos structures what is your position on getting rid of them id like to see perhaps a orbital degrading mechanic once the fuel is gone this then would open up the moons for pilots that will actually use them the current mechanic of course involves wardecing a possibly abandoned corp and then sitting there for an extended period of time blapping the structures i think something better is quite possibleeve seems to be popularly seen as more than a game perhaps moving into the hobby realm im aware that some discussions have been held with regard to finding a way to bring a more casual player or a more casual playstyle option into eve would you advocate this if so how might this be done without fundamentally changing the nature of the game would itit seems a given that csm x and ccp will look at dealing with the sovnull question this term beyond that from a gameplay perspective what would you advocate as the next priorityeve players seem to be quite passionate about the game yet it is said that the voting rate for csm elections is lower than that of even the united states midterms does this diminish the validity of the csm what would you like to do to combat the voter apathy that we see and effectively educate the voters on the reality of what the csm can effectively dofinally and most importantly do you like cats thanks so much alan mathison explorer  industrialist star tide industries
golly gosh mr lucas krell an excellent posti am one of those who believes that as long as players do not break the rules laid down by ccp any playstyle solo in groups of whatever size for whatever purpose is as valid as any other playstyleyou pays your money you makes your choice
personally that says a lot about both sabriz and yourself about sabriz it correctly identifies that sabriz is intelligent and thoughful and genuinely wants to see eve succeed even more than it already has and be a continuing success in the future about you it identifies you as an open minded and intelligent individual who is willing to put your personal dislike for sabriz play style aside and recognize that its important to have representation from all sides of a debate tips hatpersonally id love to see them either become effectively suspect or be hackable maybe not right away forgot to fuel your tower last night before bed too bad gone now but after some amout of inactive time even on the order of months would be fine with me either way i think clearing them should be a task left for playersand not be some passive event
post 1 of 2 responding to this quote limitthank you for seeing past your dislike of my ingame actions to engage seriouslybasically every eve character pretty much is a horrible person even mission runners who spend their days massacring serpentis conscripts for crimes that irl would generally only result in a couple of years imprisonment even for active participantsgankers and predatory wardeccers like me are just more honest about itfirst im assuming you are referring to highsec and c1 to c4 wormholes as the existence of dreadnoughts somewhat solves this issue in other categories of space im generally of the opinion that a players bigger marks on the sandbox like a pos should remain unless another player exercises effort in erasing it i do however endorse changes that make it take less time and less resources to destroy longinactive pos structures and also changes that provide more options for pos bashing in highsec and c1 to c4 wormholes a large pos with no defenses requires about 800 battleship minutes to destroy which is simply too long although its under 100 dreadnought minutesi havent thought extensively about this but my initial thoughts are that after 3 months of inactivity the structure would no longer be protected by concord and this would be made apparent by a suspect flag i would also support the introduction of a tech 2 battleship that is capable of entering something akin to siege mode in which it is a glass cannonthe term casual player is used to mean a lot of different things if you mean should eve change to appeal to players that want short term entertainment not a hobby i answer no ccp should not sabotage eves appeal with present customers in order to chase a currently oversaturated marketccp can market other products to that demographic like valkyrie or if it ever becomes worth marketing dustproject legion
2 of 2big question heres a few things that are very big things first1 look at aspects of the game that are presently widely botted  mining anomoly ratting agent missions  and try to make these more interactive and entertaining i have no tolerance for cheating but i think you can learn a lot from what activities cheaters automate and why they do it2 redesign the new player experience to get people interacting with other players early on id definitely want to add a mission in the training systems where you had to retrieve an item from a rats wreck but that had only minor consequences for failure and then later id add an optional mission to probe down someone doing that mission and cause them to fail it similarly a courier this package through lowsec mission which does not hurt to fail and later a steal the parcel missionsmaller things1 introduce more warnings to newer players of some of the playercreated dangers they face in new eden2 provide new players with evidence of how effective they can be in numbers if they pick fights carefully and are led we do this in the new order a lot but it applies outside gank situations tooid be a bit more concerned if more people cared who a game company used to consult with that who runs their country priorities rl is more important than a game even an obsessive hobby like evemost people dont vote because they dont think the csm is important enough to invest the time needed to make a thought out decision on who to support outside of big controversies this will continuei loathe the creatures with a passion that borders on inarticulate rage
the first question is an excellent oneim not hypercompetitive in the way that some people are this is the reason that i dont have a trillion isk in the bank yet every interaction in eve is competitive but sometimes i will make a suboptimal choice for outsideofeve reasonsre the second question if you look at my killboard and go back a while to when i was ganking more often youll see i have a significant number of failed gank attempts in addition theres all the failed attempts that dont leave a killboard mark because i aborted before initiating combatsome of these failed attempts were caused by the targets pregank dilligence others were caused by third party interference some were the result of my failed attempt to judge the damage needed to pop someone and finally some were caused by the target actively defending themselfi also at one point lost an ishtar and a hyperion and several chepaer ships to killright activationsthe costs of ganking are widely underestimated too a standard code catalyst is about 73 million isk right now assuming you are running a 20 pilot freighter gank fleet that kills one freighter every 21 minutes which is our best fc at his most efficient and doesnt allow for failed ganks it may seem we are only expending 146m isk per freighter this is an underestimatetheres an investment of 7 hours of player time per freighter gank for medium sp players thats an opportunity cost of 420 million isk spread over the fleet for high sp players its closer to 700m isk those are figures for what youd make doing low risk highly efficient pve content in highsecfinally theres a few market related risks gankers face  i was holding a lot of light neutron blaster iis when crius hit and crashed their prices i personally lost nearly a billion isk on the 3000 i had and a further quarter billion on magstabs and i expect the alliance was holding more than i was then theres hauling risk  several of us have orca or freighter alts that are blue to code but certainly are not blue to any other highsec predatorsre ganking risk vs rewardthe only reason ganking is presently profitable is the total and utter lack of concern most freighter pilots in highsec have for their own safety if freighter pilots become more dilligent we simply will not be able to kill them profitably
i dont claim there arent people who play without wanting conflictthe thing is those people do get involved in conflict without realising itlets go back to the period of the goonswarm v test war for an example consider a level 4 mission runner running missions in dodixie against serpentis rats looting every wreck and deliberately not engaging with the occasional ninja that enters their missionwhether they intend to or not that player is objectively helping the goonswarm side of the war by increasing supply of phased muon sensor disruptor i on the market which was one of their alliances main supply bottlenecks in the war here a highsec carebear is helping the goons win fleet fights in nullsecor consider an incursion fleet commander that operates purely in highsec by the simple act of deciding to change from a nightmare fleet doctrine to a paladin fleet doctrine they reduce the value of nullsec rental systems that have sansha anomolies or that produce deadspace shield modulesthis might be a more damaging to an alliance that controls that space than losing an entire 250 person ishtar fleet to bombers  all caused by someone who wanted to avoid conflictanyone who interacts with eves market in any way shape of form is involved in real loss pvp
hi sabrizhow high of a priority do place a reworking of the currently badly outdated corporation mechanics and interfacein follow up questions1 do you feel that an improved mechanic and interface could be used to create incentive for players to join a player corporation thereby increasing player interaction3 do you feel that an improvement to corp mechanics could be an incentive for people to remain in their corporation in the face of a war dec rather than simply dissolving their corp4 do you feel that such a rework would do anything either way for new player retention or veteran retentionthere is no question 2
i would like to add to that that over filled freighters are the only targets that can be chosen for any reliable ganking profits while mission boats full of purples certainly exist they are far too rare and difficult to track down to qualify as a source of income incursion boats are likewise difficult to gank due to having logi and friends nearby nearly always unless they make really poor decisions or really bad mistakesthose last two conditions are still true for freighters but people making those poor decisions and mistakes happens frequently enough that they can be killed for profit by highly organized and well supplied individuals
you will have my vote i think you do a wonderful job and take the csm job seriously
voted for core
good luck core we count on you
voted again for you core also gonna post in my fleets to vote for you  caldari and amarr mission service contact me for more info
this was asked yet no response yetbut i have to say that i am very curious to this as well as far as i can see you werent at the summit meetings at all you didnt do any of the summit minutes hardly seen you on the forums or communicating to your playerbasei realize that the normal players dont hear about all that the csm members do however obviously other csm members do know this i see a lot of endorsements from one csm member to another yet none of the csm9 have put in a good word for you here this makes me wonderthe summit is one of the most important meetings of the csm why did you not even show up are you just resting on your provi bloc to vote you in again and do nothing why are they putting up with a candidate that seems to do very little in my opinion not even the minimumso my question to you is what have you done and why should we vote for you again you were high up my ballot last year as the comparison website showed my ideas were similar to yours however i am starting to feel my vote was wasted
plz read the post on page 1 i wrote much more there now also watch eveamsterdam where i tell an hour on stage about csm and yes i wasnt elected for first summit i am on the list of the 6 csm for wintersummit in jan and the 6 for fanfest in march i hope the presentation and the post show u more insight
you do know its 7 go to the summit and 7 go to fanfest
thanks for responding so quickly i appreciate it making me reread your post and try and find the differences is not really answering my questions clearly could you please provide a list of what you have done as csm 9 why should i vote for you again it also doesnt explain why you are not endorsed by any of your fellow csm membersfrom what i understood 7 people are going to the summit not 6 not being invited for the previous summit is perhaps not your fault although you can influence this perhaps however from what i understood you guys get the possibility to be there via video chat and get recordings from the summit afterwards meaning you still could have been present remotely and still could have made minutes my compliments by the way for your presentation at evesterdam you do this well however i still have no clue what you have done as a csm9 member
i cant help but notice that i havent seen any endorsements from current csm members for you do you think your fellow csm 9 members were happy with your performance this time around what will you be doing differently clearly not taking some time to write up a proper campaign announcement post this one seems just as rushed as last timecsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
core you are the master pos basher
i think we had that debate last time as well you shoudl ask my fellow csm members that question i know i am happy and judging but the 2 invites from ccp for both summit and fanfest they not unhappy either i am not here to be voted in by my fellow csm members the voting last time showed i can stand on my own i understand the rushed  its my style and it worked last round highest solo numbers i even specifally stayed away from other csm members and crossvoting stuff this time i might change that though and team up with several frends and enemies as i got votes too sparei am happy with small stuff like pi for everyone in null which is awsome for null and especially provithe occupancy xhanges power projection the cloning changes i made the internal post for and isboxing i campaigned hard against along with others i am one of the guys that pushed hard on the null sec change and i stood behind it bigtime as also clear in eve 24 interview about that for 3 years i oreach isk shoudl flow upwards not down in evesterdam i explained alot on stage on which i got alot of positive feedback i hopefully get the change too repeat that in fanfestfor next year there s occupancy for me persoanl i like to add retaining higher sp players i am glad we got the cloning thorugh but i feel players shoudl for example get extra ccp lp points for a new shop as they grow old nd pay as loyal customers i also like to push for newcomers too get more sp quicker  closing the sp gap i named that post internalyi know my posts as dutch arent the best kinda even my trademark by now and i dont mind alot of people like it even especcially when people bash it i get supportersi hope it answers your questions a bit and gives u a btter insight but i asume more will follow
i will follow this campaign with interestyour work improving pve in dangerous space is a good thing level 5 mission hubs arent proving themselves a resource worth fighting over at the moment but they have the potential to become one if theres further work done on them and so theres definitely elements of your work i supporti particularly endorse the decision to add more lowsp oriented pve to lowsec making it more of an option to move there permanently as a rookie player fresh out of the tutorials and i think you are to credit for this correct me if i am wrong going to throw you a question when i was a rookie pilot i was terrified of lowsec after i made the usual mistake of buying a skillbook in lowsec and nearly getting killed collecting it now that i know it better i know that lowsec is fairly safe if you take precautions and fly agile shipshow would you communicate the basics of lowsec safety to new players
supporting sugar for csm is your basic nobrainer even if youre not a lowsec resident she should be very high on your ranking shell be the top nonwormholer on my ballot for the second year runningshe has worked hard communicated well and would get my vote for csm mvp this year from the outside looking inkeep up the good work sugarauthor of interstellar privateer shattered planets wormholes and game commentary
your running for reelection is excellent news you can count on my vote
i am looking for granularity inside of corporation management a clear understandable customizable flexible interface that gives a corporation choices i would like to see along side them the implementation of social groups or clubs to support a greater network of player connections
only oneiUFFFDd work some aspects auraUFFFDs tutorials into the first mission of each agent line with the ability to see if they have already done it with another agent that way they could learn to use stargates activate acceleration gates and open containers while diving into game activities it would also take away the current process of undocking in a pod and going to get their ship people get confused here and lost i think that is bad and it doesnUFFFDt make any sense to teach new players to randomly find ships in space start them in their ship be it in space or in station the pod step is needless and they get shot and warp off in a pod anyway in the combat missionssome of the csm have been keeping track internally of a lot of common questions that we are hearing i think these are very low hanging fruit questions that we see half a dozen times an hour can be included or explainedbut we need to restructure the entire thing we need to use adult learning principles to create something more engaging something that leads people into the understanding of our open world where the player not the game makes choices discovering what you want to do in eve is very hard bringing information to the surface will let people make their decision as they dive deeper into the game
the best part of this is that if for some reason you quit before undocking to pick up your ship then log back in you get a notification from pend insurance offering condolences for the loss of your ship and offering you a rookie ship ready and waiting in your hangarthe worst thing about the npe is that it only really flows if you do everything the way its intended to be done and of course new players are going to do everything except whats intended
yes i was the advocate for bringing low level exploration to low sec when the static ded complexes were removed in december of 2012i donUFFFDt teach safety i teach awareness awareness gives you the ability to react and make choices that will hopefully keep you alive and that making all the right choices can still not end well due to the unpredictable nature of low sec i teach it by flying with them sharing my game day with them and showing them what i do and why i do it
100 will vote for great csm member fantastic to talk to and get told off by  and always willing to helpsugar kyle csm member of my heart
hi sugaryou are one of the three csm9 members ive heard the most about at this point im quite happy youre running for reelection this will be the first csm where i have been able to vote yes new player  id like to ask you some questions im asking the candidates im seriously considering if i couldspace has become littered with abandoned pos structures what is your position on getting rid of them id like to see perhaps a orbital degrading mechanic once the fuel is gone this then would open up the moons for pilots that will actually use them the current mechanic of course involves wardecing a possibly abandoned corp and then sitting there for an extended period of time blapping the structures i think something better is quite possibleeve seems to be popularly seen as more than a game perhaps moving into the hobby realm im aware that some discussions have been held with regard to finding a way to bring a more casual player or a more casual playstyle option into eve would you advocate this if so how might this be done without fundamentally changing the nature of the game would itit seems a given that csm x and ccp will look at dealing with the sovnull question this term beyond that from a gameplay perspective what would you advocate as the next priorityeve players seem to be quite passionate about the game yet it is said that the voting rate for csm elections is lower than that of even the united states midterms does this diminish the validity of the csm what would you like to do to combat the voter apathy that we see and effectively educate the voters on the reality of what the csm can effectively dofinally and most importantly do you like cats thanks so much alan mathison explorer  industrialist star tide industries
hi alan ahh derelict pos towers i participated in a crowd sourced idea thread at the start of the year there is a link to my blog post in the topic as well as some comments i would like to steal peoples abandoned towers hacking decreased shields decay mechanics i donUFFFDt believe you should be able to just have abandoned expensive structures hanging around in space with twenty four hour warnings for you to online themgiving people tools to play their game instead of trying to build the exact game play that you want them to have will allow each person to create their version of casual medium or heavy gameplay i cannot tell you what is casual you may consider my casual gameplay to not be casual then we are off telling each other how to play eve and there is no need for that an example would be if missions became more dynamic where if a player were offered better missions if they headed across space but kept the same rewards if they were content doing the work they were currently doing instead of forcing them to travel across the game which may eat into the hour they have set aside for a game play session they can now make the choice of what to do with their free time that best suites their personal gamefortunately ccp does several things at once while sov will be the major topic for csmx we also have corps and alliances and pos that are happening at the same time they are just as large these things are all intertwined plus we will have complex topics inside of sov such as structures and how they work in the game many of these structures such as poco and pos are shared outside of null sec and changes to their usage have to be looked at globallyvoter apathy is hard to combat it is hard to combat in eve and it is hard to combat irl i do not think that it diminishes the csm i think that it gives more responsibility to the csm to make sure that they are looking outside of the csm active player base to see how changes will affect those who do not tune into the metagame i am not a marketing person and i do not have a marketing strategy to give you we can only put the information and ourselves out there in as many formats as possible and try to raise awareness by doingi do like cats qwinn is currently sleeping on the heated pet bed i purchased because he turns fourteen this winter and getting arthritic he also greets me at the door and sleeps by my pillow at night my husband brought sabrina and sebastian to our marriage they are siblings and turning fifteen that is why we have more than one heated pet bed

please dont humor dirk he has bad taste in music and should be hanged ingame of course for itif elected to the csm will you host a weekly podcast discussing eve with people across all party lines you could call it  on csm you dont have to break nda
i am a huge fan of s on zulu and doink has been kind enough to host it early  sometimes as early as 2pm est when jeffraider has barely finished his second bottle  in order to let me join in from my filthy european ruritaniabut doink is also an unreliable shirker who hasnt arranged a podcast in weeks and who only serves to remind people how awful sa goons are these days by inviting terrible star trek online people on to make 2006era jokes about gamers with a blithe lack of selfawarenessto expand upon my earlier comments about friends across the game doink is a pandemic legion member who also has a character in my corp bat country where he could spy on us if he wants i trust him to behave we like to talk to our friends and eve online is just a silly game which isnt worth getting rawr rawr angry about over we also have a very senior bni leader in corp for the same reason and a couple of others from the red side of eve contrary to other peoples fear and paranoia about eve ive never been let down by any of the hostiles ive had in corp and ive made friends i wouldnt have otherwise as a result
from your ideas listthe answer to that was identified as the hyper travel teleportation as i like to call it going from one side of the game to the other in 7 minutes with a carrier while even the fastest interceptor taking gates would take an hourany new alliance that did not immediately snuggle up and become part of an existing coalition never stood a chance because they would be the latest content addition to null in which content starved coalitions would dog pile on top of in just minutes there was zero incentive to not go and feast on them when the coalitions territory is completely safe from anyone who is not part of the enemy coalition timers would last for days and crossing the map was just a few minutes young budding alliances had no choice but to join a coalition if they wanted to be in null and so much as take a single system and at that point are they even a separate entity or just another cog in the coalition machine you know the answerthe only solution was to drop a nuclear bomb on the mechanics that involve hyper traveljump fatigue is arguably the greatest change in eve online it started working before phoebe hit as you saw some alliances remove themselves from renters and after phoebe coalitions are showing in dramatic form i might add that they can not concentrate their forces in one spot without losing territory in others for the first time in who knows how long the small guy can actually take a small piece of null for themselves they can actually field a capital ship without worries of supers from all four corners of the map cynoing in on top of them just because there was nothing else going onnow groups have to make strategic decisions on where to place capitals where and when they should take that jump bridge is dropping ten carriers on that single battlecruiser worth it do i join in on this black ops hot drop and then miss the opportunity to cyno in with some of my alliance mates for a cta in an hour again strategic decisions are back in play which brings me to your opinion on black opsbehold you are now having to make a strategic decision and because of this you are not able to power project all over anything that moves just because which of course means good news for that young alliance that is just now taking hold of a single system in null it means that you are having to decide which is more important the alliance cta to do important stuff or go black ops hot drop all over that new guy because you are boredwhat i despise is some people who because they cant take a cyno feel like they are not able to join their mates in glorious combat take a gate capital ship via gates will take too long well ship down a bit into something that will travel faster guess what now because you want to project power at a distance with relative speed balance enters the scene and you have to sacrifice firepower for speedyou are a great guy but i will not send any votes your way if you are going to lobby to have power projection reverted back and the game falls back into the ultra stagnant boring state it was in there is growing pains to these big changes ccp are doing but i assure you they are for what is best for the gamei wish there was a way i could explain it better for you to see all the good jump fatigue is doing but if i cant do it after all this time then i suppose there is no changing your mind this doesnt mean i disagree with you on the rest of your platform but i dont want to see eve put back on its knees again i hope you understand
marlona sky youre my favourite battle nereus queenmuch space respect flowing your wayvote 1 bobmong 4 prez
thanks for your comments i 100 agree that the prephoebe state was very bad but i think that this state change because of a lot of reasons and not purely the jump fatigue itself often fear and diplomatic contracts are much worse then actual ingame tools b0tlord is a prime example pl has always done think for certain period look at the hbc pl was involved but after a few month they sorta left and that created a lot of content same pretty much goes for botlord we do it for a while and then cut it all off and have fun somewhere else was the patch crucial i would say no the nullsec is something that we are more nervous for jump fatigue had increadable effects but it ruins a lot of fun for the individual pilot i hate this i find it very strange that me as a individual pilot im forced to basicly not use a certain ship because it will stop me later on in joining up fleets i think the future would be much better if we created a so called jump button this would work as followedright click modle  select system current menu  click system jump  wait certain time 10mins and continue you can even add a activation timer when clicking the module and maybe everytime you use it it would take longer like current fatigue this would allow a pilot to both join his ops and have fun doing blackops and such bare in mind my ideas are just ideas and it is something that i would love to work on then again you can pretty much forget that if any csm gets into office that hisher ideas will be immidiatly implemented
all en24 trolls aside bobmon has been an uncompromising journalist as far as eve news is concerned id expect him to bring the same integrity and energy to the csm
lolololon a serious note though bob has evolved from the spin king of eve journalism 
he has to change his name if he joined ccp it should become ccp babeman

i still dont understand what is stopping you from taking gates to join up with your fleet what is preventing you from choosing a faster ship to meet up with them if they are far away
the join in a frigate and take gates approach is indeed an option but not one that i like this is because it simply doesnt work in actual in daytoday fleet concepts frigates are important but if you have a pilot who can fly the main ship then they should also lets not forget that pilots join fleets because they know they get kills thats what gets them excited and i dont want this excitement to be hurt by being forced into frigate sure with jump fatigue you fixes the problem off alliances being able to jump all over the map but you are forgetting that those fleets all have members in them who do things in eve on their own as well compare it to when you break your arm you go to the docter and he fully wraps you in with plaster because he then has fixed the problem right yeah he did fix your problem but meanwhile he created a lot more because you are fully wrapped up
throwing my support to bobmon for being an active eve player in many parts of the game and being a very active community member he is legitimately concerned with whats going on in eve and will make an excellent csm member

joke question will you be stealing csm ships to sell to anticsm teams during a tournament if so can i get a good deal on said shipsserious questions as you were sadly not in the initial 14 delegates properly elected and came into your current csm 9 seat due to csm 9 members stepping down what do you feel are the best examples of the work youve done during your currently brief time as a delegatewhat do you feel csm 9 has failed at as a group in serving their role this past yearwhat do you feel was your biggest failure as a csm 9 delegate during your time on councilcan you please link ccp members this song in the csm 9 channel
as for the first question i was kicked from pl because shamis thought i wasnt safe enough to have around the alliance tournament team and therefore not safe to have in pl the reason penif didnt protect me was because i never really flew with pl at all i only joined because i know lelob and i only stayed because i liked the community that i still have access to and for real who needs spies to beat dual tanked vagabonds and beam zealotswhen i came on the csm halfway through many of the major things in rhea and phoebe was already decided so i had nothing to contribute to that what i did suggest was the removal of anchorable bubbles in thera i also supported the removal of clones fully because i think its a mechanic that currently offers no actual gameplay nobody ever chooses not to update their clone and the game itself flashes the cloning thing when you die to make sure you remember it is just an arbitrary fee attached to pvp i have not been involved with the csm for the full term so they probably made some failures during the start of the term there might have been some failures of communication etc that i missed but for the part where i have been on the csm it has been really great there are ofc people who are going to work way harder or way less then others but as a group i think we really manage to give good feedback on the things ccp shares with usmy biggest failure in the csm so far is that i wont link that song in the csm skype channel p for real though i think my biggest failure is that i have missed some meeting because of my real life work schedule it is a good thing they are recorded

ill admit i was pretty skeptical of sion last year but as top of the goon ballot he was getting in regardless ive watched the summit minutes twitter and various other public outlets closely for his contributions this year and have been pleasantly surprised with what ive seen sion came in looking like a typical metaonly goon director but has shown a solid breadth of capability and knowledge not just an axe to grind for what can help the cfc he is clearly thinking about what is good for the game as wellim going to be sorry to see mynnnas expertise in the financials go away but sion will be getting an endorsement from me in my endorsement post this year despite that it is irrelevant to his electionmy only advice more posts please either on a blog or tmdc whatever your writeup of the monument thing was fantastic id love to see you post thoughts at that level of depth on more ingame topicsthe key question is will you or endie be top of ballot for the cfcthanks for your service and proving my concerns wrong this term sionauthor of interstellar privateer shattered planets wormholes and game commentary
according to official goonswarm documents and wikis the only group of players that the cfc are not allowed to scam are people in the cfc or who are blue to them the same documents used for legitimate recruitment of new members from sa into goonwaffe also provide links to guides on how to scam newer or less experienced players out of their space cash goonswarm even has several dummy sites hosted for the sole purpose of convincing people to provide 500million isk collateral and a full api key in exchange for membership in goonswarm in fact the only time when it was against goonswarm policy to scam or otherwise exploit newbies or any player for that matter it was also long before members were allowed to post on the eve forums at present there exists no official rule or policy prohibiting candidates or members of the csm from lying to their constituents if i am elected i hope to change that
as mentioned earlier in this thread the ganker game has become highly organized activity where a group of predators select their hauler prey and then executes it swiftly and without remorse often the chosen victim is taken unawaresa main avenue of defense is for haulers to attempt to look less appealing in the hopes that some other victim will be chosenthings like increasing tank and decreasing cargo value are the primary mechanisms usedhowever the information flow tends to be one way from victim to ganker would you support changes to give the hauler some control over information flow that potentially could make a prey look more appealing than it isfor example perhaps have a fake plex item that on a passive cargo scan looks exactly like a real plex but on an active scan it shows as being a fake this could complicate the ganker decision process and also alas give scammers a boost where they have contracts selling fake plexes for the price of real plexalternatively create a variation of reinforced bulkheads that gives slightly less tank but reports itself as an expanded cargohold on a passive scanthese changes could make the head game a bit more complicated and perhaps more fun
moudibhmmm not much of an issues conversation started here so lets see what discussion we can startspace has become littered with abandoned pos structures what is your position on getting rid of them id like to see perhaps a orbital degrading mechanic once the fuel is gone this then would open up the moons for pilots that will actually use them the current mechanic of course involves wardecing a possibly abandoned corp and then sitting there for an extended period of time blapping the structures i think something better is quite possibleeve seems to be popularly seen as more than a game perhaps moving into the hobby realm im aware that some discussions have been held with regard to finding a way to bring a more casual player or a more casual playstyle option into eve would you advocate this if so how might this be done without fundamentally changing the nature of the game would itit seems a given that csm x and ccp will look at dealing with the sovnull question this term beyond that from a gameplay perspective what would you advocate as the next priorityeve players seem to be quite passionate about the game yet it is said that the voting rate for csm elections is lower than that of even the united states midterms does this diminish the validity of the csm what would you like to do to combat the voter apathy that we see and effectively educate the voters on the reality of what the csm can effectively dofinally and most importantly do you like cats thanks much alan mathison explorer  industrialist star tide industries
hi sabrisafter reading your csm thread i have decided to step down and give my vote to you i find that i am in agreement with much of your points and i will gladly give you my input on accessibility for those of you reading this i stronly recommend that you vote for sabriz adoudel for csm x
im conflicted with my hatred of code and my want to see this issue addressed
i still consider that you should run we have different audiences and your area of expertise appeals to some of the people that would never vote for a highsec predator like myselfas discussed in our evemails its your decision you could encourage people to vote for you first and me second and people that dont like me could simply not follow that advicei stand by my comments earlier however  if i am elected and you are not i will use your knowledge of accessibility issues as a resource and i encourage other csm candidates to do the same
thanks i will consider it i really dont want to make a rused decision and be viewed as a fliflopper
calm yourself its not as bad as you think
i absolutely love logistical style things like this in my single player gamesjust not in evemy first reason for disliking this involves your realism point its not realistic to consider that a space fairing group as advanced as the eve humans havent perfected some form of reactors on their ships that require very little fuel already anyway the comment about the bussard ramjet pretty much sums this up there shouldnt be a need for fuel for day to day operationsthe second reason involves the recent removal of the skill queue 24 hour limit and the upcoming clone cost removal ccp is in the process of removing these busy work mechanics that require you to do something before you actually get to play the game your fuel mechanic is the very definition of this i must purchase this fuel before i can actually go and enjoy the aspect of the game i way to be doing it would just add another thing to list of things you need to remember to dowhat if i want to go on a roam from the top of the map to the bottom would i be forced to stop along the way at fuel stations just so i can go and find someone to shoot what about the miners who just sit there in front of rocks with lasers cycling do they use fuel for that too or are they exempt because they arent moving what happens if some otec style agreement is made between large alliances and coalitions with the fuel only available in 00 similar to what happened with technetium does that mean no one else can fly caps because those guys are hording all the fuel for capsit just doesnt work in eve in my opinion its just more busy work for the average pilot and the last thing eve needs is more busy work
one thing to fix would be these ing forums i just wrote three full replies and it threw them away because it throught there was some html in it somewhere rather than just leaving it there and maybe high lighting what it does not like i am still in the process of writing a book on how to take societies forward into a technocratic meritocracy with socialistic tendencies how could technocratic structures be applied to eveccp are fantastic at analysing the data that we produce market trends ship usage some really bizarre stuff too it wouldnt be beyond possible to analyse who are the most active and in what types of space there are aspects to it how many lead fleets how many do it without having roles how many corp or alliance leaders are out there ratting mining and such with their teams the scope is boundless thus it would be possible to seek people out and approach them to run for csmthose that seek power are often the worst to hold it yes i know csm doesnt really have all that much relatively speaking and yes that is more of a rl thingadditionally to misquote the poet some are born to represent some strive to represent and some have the role thrust upon them give me more of the third upon the first and curb the secondccp could send out messages in all local chats a pop up much like the down time message could come up three times a day for three days leading up to the final votei doubt that i shall garner more than a few votes tossed at me as nothing more than a lark as i said in your thread you have my vote i probably wont get past this stage but hopefully there will be some discussion toward maybe getting ccp to stop serving up victims that dont have a chance against a little gang of thugs we need more ability to fight back and save shipsthat is exactly one aspect that i strive for with this thank you
steve is quite awesome and he needs to share how much he does he makes spreadsheets and complex mathematical figures appear out of mid discussion he picks up projects simply because he can get them done and forgets to mention that he took care of it hes always been willing to assist me with my projects using his time and skills he also walks way way to fast its really bad youre at the bottom of the hill and steve vanishes into the sunset that to is impressive
i was going to ask you some serious questions on your stance on some things in the game like high sec low sec nullsec wormholes faction warfare industry lp stores ship balancing and the likebut i have no idea what you do or were you live in eve your whole arguments for voting for you is people donUFFFDt like you and itUFFFDs not your fault people donUFFFDt like the csm so vote for me your campaign is about brining reform to the csm without even saying what the problem is other than stv is bad and gerr goons and you seem to have showed you have almost zero understanding of the whole stv system other than what you read on a wiki page one daymaybe you should start with what you like to do in eve and other than how the csm works what you would like to see change inside the game rather than outside of it because the only bit that matters in eve is in eve
unfortunately i could not support this platform based on these two sections it comes across very much as grr gankers it is not for you to say i dont want your content and make yourself immune from itid be interested to hear your version of balance that you say is missing despite the constant nerfs to ganking over time how far do things need to go before they are balanced what is your vision of that state
hi alani know what you mean as i write one of my alts is sitting in his typhoon firing torpedoes at a poco that i am sure is no longer needed by the oneman corps that put it there a long time ago that is really tediousi would not be against having some form of decay that requires a corporation that owns structures to be active and interact with them or how about removing the reinforced timer from some things that get shot at if they are from an inactive corporation so there is no 24 hour timer to be activeinactive could be defined in several ways but for example either refuelling or not having a director logging in for a specific amount of timeall play styles should be possible but i thought that that was the point of eve there are already casual players here and playing so i dont think per se that the game needs to be fundamentally changed what we have seen is that social interaction increases the chance of player retention this is where i probably say that thing again that i have said earlier in my thread about social corporations that have no real ability to impact anything in the gamethe new player experienceproviding new players with the tools to learn to play and have fun for example there are many out there that have seen the latest this is eve trailer and want to be a part of that we need to take that starting enthusiasm and somehow keep it going before people get fed up whilst running against the learning cliffthe csm is what it is if the eve players are not interested in it then that is their own fault everyone has a chance to votefirstly i would love to see an option for the players that are actively interested in the game or are actively interested in the csm but not any of the candidates to have a none of the above option when voting then we could get reliable statistics on the apathy of the eve players and stealing an idea from another candidate maybe ccp could implement a popup like the downtime popups so that everyone on log in gets a pop up saying dont forget to vote for the csm during the last week of the campaignsand as to your question about catsi like cats as much as the next person but where i live domesticcatsgoneferal are a real problem for all manner of wildlifei would advocate responsible cat ownership
toradespite all the smoke and heat being generated over gankers and wardecs there is much more going on in hisecccp has revealed that there are many eve players such as myself who have no interest in tears either given or receivedthese players are a nontrivial part of the player basewhat are the best ideas you have heard about improving their gaming experience
i can agree about the fact small corps are destroyed by a bigger fish its happened to me and ive done to other corps but this shouldnt be a reason to help the defending corp defending corps are broken because the people inside the corp are not willing to help each other ive run with small gang wardecing corps my entire time in eve no more than 20 people asides from one small time when deadly fingertips became rather large and join ikr for a brief moment i would like to say i know a fair bit on wardecs and how they function from at least a meta standpoint the reason most corps loose to a aggressing corp is because for the most part a wardeccing corp has more teamwork shares a common goal and in general has a better atmosphere than a 20 to 5 we do everything corp the we do everything corp basically means from what ive seen here go mine mission or whatever here are some people to talk to while you do it we dont have a goal in mind and so whatever there is no comradery no strive for a goal no team just i that is why most corps in highsec break because when push comes to shove no one in this we do everything corp is willing to stick up for each other and fight together that is why a merc corp or wardecing corp does by far better than they do because a wardeccing corp has set themselves to have a goal to work together and everyone in the merc corp is ready for it basically what im saying is a social corp will always no matter how much the isk paid no matter how many people are in it will break to a focused corp with a goal and interest in mind so you can raise the wardec cost raise to the moon all you want it wont make highsec any better itll probably make even more stagnant because the one drive force in eve is emotion greed angry whatever if you get mad you get focused and then the magic happens also i currently run a solo wardeccing corp why should i be singled out im but a single pilot verse many currently im dec with corp that is around 50 members there is no amount of sp that will save me from 20 or so moas blasting my proteus to oblivion a solo wardeccer is by far the most balanced part in the wardeccing mechanics because he is very vulnerable were as a alliance like fa can easily counter and defend attacks on them so why should i not be allowed to take that risk and work alone and have a challenge and know that i dont have no offence to fa 5 dps proteus with rook ecm on standby when i camp a gate thats the best way i can word this so hope you understand deletetheweak
the best idea i have is to start talking to people who feel this way why would i make up solutions if i havent even talked to the players who see it as a problem this answer you will get from me for a lot of issues in eve a csm should talk to people listen to them get things back to basics see how the rest of eve things about it and if not why not communicate this with the players who see curtain things as an issue and then find common grounds we can all agree upontldr  a good csm talks to peoplevalkin mordirc  you dont have to create a social club just because of the numbers in corp its a choice you make just as you can make a choice now to be in an npc corp and i think they wont break down because they will have no wars just as the current npc players so there is almost no difference between them biggest plus here is you can start forming a corp get used to corp mechanisms etc without worrying about war decs these will probably be the same players who are in a npc corp now
stay on topic if its attention you seek let me know and i will send you a postcard
it would seem that in your campaign thread someone explaining why in their opinion your arent a good candidate for the csm would seem to be remarkably on topic
i think abla is looking to judge your feelings on the subject rather than asking what your specific solutions are at this moment in time it is important that a csm rep at least has an understanding of the matters that they are going to represent if not all the answersso to put ablas question a different way what are top 3 most important issues you personally see regarding pveincursionsmissioning in hisec that you feel should be tackled any rough idea or direction you would take to make these aspects of the game better are a bonus
i am not a pve player so i cant answer that question what do you think are the top 3 issues 
i agree that this is an issue ganking has been balanced over the years to the point it is uncommon at least nowhere near a daily or weekly occurrence for any player even those in higher risk professions to ever see one that means the estimation of risk by a player especially a new one might be inaccurate and a player can over time risk more and more thinking it is safe before a gankerpirate catches up with them and relieves them of their assets in a catastrophic fashion the obvious solution is to buff ganking to make it more common something that players have to deal with more frequently but i wont suggest that as first i dont want to be accused of lobbying for game changes for selfinterest as i have been known to gank on occasion and second judging from the comments of the csm and even the current developers at ccp the prevailing winds seem to still be blowing in the direction of making highsec safer for various reasons therefore i will make an alternative proposal to slightly increase the level of risk in the game and am curious what your thoughts are on it toraplayers afk because there is very little risk since also players seem to really not like losing their stuff to another player i suggest a new rare npcbased mechanism for risk be added to the game these will be new sleeper npcs that appear very infrequently across known space spawning on gates stations and beltsanomalies at a frequency that is low enough that players will run into them only rarely 1100 hours in space but not never the first spawn will just be a frigate that double webs the nearest ship and begins to apply a very small amount of damage a few minutes later time can be tuned as desired it will call in a sleeper cruiser and a few minutes after that a battleship that will be able to apply enough damage to destroy any ship within minutes the main effect of this will be deter prolonged afk behaviour in space any player that is at the keyboard during a spawn or returning to the keyboard after hearing the alarms can just warp away any player that is really afk will lose their ship you can also make them drop cool stuff if players choose to engage them as they will be too rare and random to farm efficientlythis rare encounter will train players that space is dangerous as it was designed to be and that unattendedautopiloting ships can really be destroyed by npcs or other players and this will deter them from routineextended use of autopilotingafk and come to think of it make bot programers life a little more difficult if you want to be clever you could even make it so these sleepers can spawn anywhere in space where a player is and decloak them as a game mechanism to counter afk cloaking i am not sure that is a good idea although i really have no opinion but i think it would be a good counter to make new eden more like ccp falcons vision of a dangerous place rather than the safe space conducive to afk hauling at least in highsec that it currently is
i really like this idea it makes the belts more active it prevents afk mining it gives gankers in belts an extra challenge and then there is no need for afk buttons to click it could also make belts more fun for non miners too brain fart  now if we do this on active gates too it prevents ganker  merc  etc camps staying at one gatesystem to long new surprising content is what makes eve great so just smashalot
considering the recent direction and developments by ccp i find your platform mostly frivolous if not meaningless and misguided unfortunately im going to have to side with code on this one shudder and say that i wont be supporting you in this election
mercsgankersetc wont even have to hunt anyomore haulers and war targets will just be killed by npcs now let the game play for you instead of having to play yourself such gameplay much wow
i doubt it these npc arent suppose to be unkillable so i imagine an organized gate camp will have no problem dispatching the webbing frigate you would still need players to break an organized gate campplus remember these are suppose to be rare  just a small theoretical risk to make people a little more careful and used to the idea they can lose their stuff if they are afk they shouldnt impact normal daily game play much at all
but then they have aggression timers and cant jump and why make them rare i rather see them join the fun more often
you can propose any idea you want you can also have them use scrams or if you want real chaos pod players i imagine though you will get some flak for proposing the addition of a bunch of bloodthristy npcs cutting a swath through highsecs carebear population on a regular basis i honestly prefer playerdriven solutions but npcs in highsec are currently inconsequential  i am not sure if they were always weak or have been just been left behind by the years of buffing of player ships having the odd powerful one pop up from timetotime and actually force a player to flee or fight might be a good idea
hell ill vote for you if for the sake of game changes are always needed for a game to evolve and keep the fun factor highi dont necessarily agree with some of your ideas but there are always unexpected and unforeseen outcomes which i always find entertaining1eve is dying  the four forum trolls of the apocalypse  pick four any four they all smell 
yes specifically for exampleas i said immediately after that i dont ignore tactics i dont use autopilot and i dont fly freighterscheers for not listening again though bang your tinny little drum all dayon topic i eagerly await toras reaction to mangalas proposals for alternative social structures within eve
i think interactions between players in eve not just in high sec should become deeper more complex and more interesting that certainly doesnt and cant reasonably exclude ganking but its not limited to ganking either
ah yes if you are looking at another complete rerebalance of freighter slot allocation and hp distribution then significantly more options open up while agree that the ones you presented do not provide exciting gameplay for anyone they at least make being at your keyboard significantly advantageous to make up for that perhaps some form of active module that reduces align time not only are you now tougher while at the keyboard but your travel times will be significantly reduced just a random off the top of my head ideaif the value that can be safely carried in a freighter is in fact as low as 500m then i would agree thats too low i was under the impression it was closer to 2b which i feel is a fair number now of course the numbers will be dependent of the freighter fit for an antitanked freighter 500m might be fine whereas a fully tanked freighter should be higher
then i believe you and i are at least conceptually in agreement perhaps with differences in ideas and priorities of implementation
sorry i think missed the question the recommendations regarding incentives for defenders typical involved hs space its pretty widely assumed that a small to medium corp in null thats not in an alliance is going to have a bad time ls life will be hard but manageable and in wh space you just might be ok but youll have to fight hard
that module already exists its called a microwarpdrive 10 second align times on freighters would make them absurdly safefounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
i dont think you caught what he was getting at
hmm allowing freighters to have microwarps interesting idea that could certainly work and the mass bloom would help them resist bumping
the bowhead will be a good test case for this it is shaping up to be the safest large industrial in high secfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information

well this is new ill be watching
a new highsec will be created soon my friends
not at all the frigate would be easily killed and if it is the rest do not spawn in his recommendation the frigate is essentially just a warning if you deal with it theres no problem and no escalation
lol thatd be both funny and kinda cool what would be the effect of fitting one of these on a bumping machariel lol
thumbs up for awesome propaghanda
im still interested in the idea of eliminating afk playwhich i cant say that i totally agree with since using freighters as an example ended up starting another subject ill use a personal examplewhen we were still in wspace we happened upon a couple of rr dominixes ratting in a c5 we caught one the other got away now an ishtar and a vexor vs a dominix is not a slamdunk fight so initially we were scrambling to get an advantage and then we realized that he wasnt going to fight back he was just going to wait for us to blow up his ship and get his pod away so what started as a thrilling showdown became sitting there watching our autoorbiting autofiring drone boats gnawing on a battleship tank while we spammed dscan nobody else was around except for the other dominix safe in its tower i understand and respect that some people get a thrill from gaining an advantage on another player but i dont i would rather lose an interesting fight than win a onesided rout hell id rather lose a onesided rout at least i can learn something from watching the other guys tactics so the whole thing was pretty dullits not literally afk play but its about as close as you can get in wspace without being a complete idiot does this count or are you more worried about literally afk as in not near the machine or with full attention in another window because the problem there is that its extremely hard to tell why someone is not inputting into the client you only know that they are so it becomes a question of finding out what gameplay rewards that kind of behavior and then changing itif they want it changedi spent a lot of time as a newbie jetcan mining in my cargoexpanded navitas it was a way to make a little isk and chat with people while devouring the eve university wiki sure my attention was on the wiki but at least i was learning the game
out of respect to toras csm campaign although i wish his platform was different but still im not going to continue this here if you would like to discuss it more this thread is a good place to gohowever before i go think about this you admit to not using freighters and you also dont need to be aware of freighters alignment times fittings ehp strategy etc because you dont gankbump them yet here you are arguing points about freighters that you admittedly dont use
sweet huge plus for new groups
im curious would you want this to be a relatively riskfree activity in highsec if this was enabled i could see the mass rush for everyone to go out and find abandoned large towers in highsec to sell with little to no risk except from gankers perhaps i think it might be interesting if hacking a corporations anchored tower gave you a suspect flag perhaps
yup wouldnt really be an election if i didnt run now would iti am mike azariah hisec resident and i am tossing my hat in the ring for csmxi have served on the previous csm8 and am a member of csm9 and am still willing to keep doing what i am doingcsm is a team effort so it is hard to take credit for things that are done but there are one or two that i feel i have had a stronger hand in i fought to keep some form of drone assist active i pushed for the bowhead ship most of all i have tried damn hard to keep the lines of communication between the players and the csm and on through to ccp open podcasts blogs i will drop into fleets or do side conversations i listen to playersdoesnt mean i always agree with them but i listen and if i say i will take it up with ccp i havei expect a few folks will post into this thread trying to hang a label on me and some of them will be accurate    and some wont the ones i accept are carebear although i do pvp from time to time casual player although there are days when i spend too damn long on that computer to quote my wife a reasonable person to talk to although i do confess i like the nickname northern troll and last but one of my favourites    anarchist thanks sioni am passionate about balance of game about the new player experiences about keeping the game a solid deep challenge for new and old players i have seen the roadmap and i want to continue to be a part of the paving crewso i ask for your supportmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD

good luck its nice to have a highsec person on the csm and someone who appreciates pve play will definitely support

mike what would you like to see done to increase interactions between players in high security space both in terms of forcing players to work together and having them work against each otherfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
i want to see the tools for social groups strengthened mailing lists enlargened i would really like to see an entirely new set of mechanics for people who hang together for specidc things like code bombers bar redemtion road mining fleets mission teams and incursions to focus on the hisec sort of thing grouping is the glue that makes this an mmo and we need to keep working on the tools that help thatbut i do take issue with your wording of the question we should never have to force folks into groups or interactivity there are people perfectly happy to play solo to be the lone wolf hunter or the quiet single industrialist there is nothing wrong with that and we shouldnt punish them for that style of play casual players face this the most since often they have limited game time to be online or odd hours and so they find it difficult to be reliable in a social group and they self isolatetldr so i want ccp to develop the tools to facilitate interaction but i do not want to force itmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD

you are an eve player who once posted that highsec reward should not be nerfed because so much else depends on itdo you believe that other areas of space should be made more profitable relative to highsec in order to drive conflict and higher population densities outside of highsec what would you say if i accused highsec reward and profitability of making struggles for resources in other areas less meaningful
calls for nerfing highsec income are usually based on the idea that they are playing it wrong so we need to force them to play our way i disagree with that style of thinking if you want to make another portion of new eden have an advantage such as industrialism in low and null i was in favour of thatif you start quoting riskreward i will ask what risk afktars in null suffer or rental agreements some things are not a matter of risk they are a matter of effort time a miner may not be doing glorious battle but his effort is soemthing he is willing to do why should we asdk that he do it in places where anybody can pop him for the fun of it more so than they already can in highsecthe generalization of more profitable regions is just that too general i think each section of space has appropriate activities and then some edge cases it is smarter to carebear in relative safety it is better to run industry where you are the government null sov profit margins for a trade center in low should be higher because of the risks that they takebut give me a good reason why we should nerf highsec rewards then ask if that same reason applies to other regions or is it you just want more targets in your spacemmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i listen to numerous eve podcasts and im pretty sure ive heard mike on every one of them what ive learned about him is that he doesnt care for just one aspect of the game he cares about the entire game i dont know if i always agree with his positions but i respect the fact that he presents his positions with a veritable heap of information as to why he feels the way he does and why he thinks things should or should not be changed he reads the forums to make sure he remains in touch with the rest of the player base and he makes a friggin list of things to check into im not sure how he manages to play the game let alone spend time with his family and workhe is a voice of reason and sanity in a place where crazies often get the most attention 3 votes from me mikeps  thanks for all your hard work with the newbrospps  im gonna go buy a holidy card this weekend and send it out next week
ill return to your questions later but with respect to gank targetstech 1 industrials are also a profitable choice especially if prescanned for expensive cargo and they can comfortably be killed and looted with two accountsmission runner ganking was profitable if done exactly right prior to the recent exploration changes you used to be able to sell atype and xtype modules in a mission hub watchlist anyone that purchased them run locators on them and pop them with an alpha fleet to confiscate your sold modules backhowever recent changes to exploration and expeditions have increased supply of those modules to the point that the numbers no longer really work out heres an interesting point of how everything in eve is interconnected increased module drop rewards for lowsec and nullsec exploration and anomolies have resulted in reduced profitability of highsec gankingincursion ships are indeed tough nuts to crack i have done extensive theorycrafting on this matter and offered significant prizes as incentives to others to shoot them without much success the main disincentive to ganking incursion runners is that scooping loot drops postgank is extremely hard making forprofit ganks difficult part of this is due to the incursion runners active defense of each other a trait i respect and one that should contribute to their safety but another major factor is rat ai incursion rats strongly prioritize shooting anyone that uses a warp scrambler or ewar which means that the rats actually provide assistance to incursion runners if you try to attack them when they are weakest
these are basically all one question so ill combine the answerfirstly theres people that want a corporation lite that is just a chat channel i think this functionality is better served by actual chat channels there is a community around the minerbumping channel which includes people who are in code people who support code people who dont support our in game actions but find us hilarious and spies this community was my home not the various corporations ive been in since i discovered itits currently extremely hard to find a corporation that seems like it might be a good fit for your playstyle within the game client this isnt an eve exclusive phenomenon  its the case in every online game ive played in my experience from other games voice chat is what coheres communities and helps you quickly ascertain nope these people arent for me or yep ill get on well with this groupcorporation public chat rooms with voice chat would go a long way to improving players finding corps i believe if i could make one change to the corp interface it would be encouraging the use of corp public voice chat through eve voice corporations could then carry out whatever recruitment security screening they felt was appropriate and recruit interested people that pass their opsecid also add the ability for corporations to bring nonmembers into their corp chat channeli want to see players incentivised to hold on to a corporation and defend it when attacked through some mixture of carrots and sticks that makes holding on usually the highest ev play from a game theoretical point of view currently the ingame benefits to being in a 1 person corp that was established yesterday are the same as or slightly higher than the benefits of being in a six month old 30 person corpi would like to see some setup where the more ore your corp has mined over its history the more mining related boosts your corps medium to long term members receive the more rats your corp has killed the more bonuses to missioning andor incursion running andor anomoly ratting you receive and so on i dont have all of the answers herefor retention getting newbies interacting with other players is needed otherwise they mostly follow the level up your dominix then quit path for retaining established players its their social ties within game that are key witness the cfc titan pilot that was recently accused of being a spy and expelled with extreme prejudice  the titan loss wasnt what made him uninstall eve it was the severing of social ties from what ive heard hes back playing now and his alliance reinstated him in good standing replaced his titan and consider him loyal not a spymaking the game theoretical correct play be to stay invested in your corp will help with keeping those social ties
this statement is incorrectdepends on your definition of conflict arguably if you play any multiplayer game you have an effect on other players but when you say that all activities should be balanced in ways that drive player conflict youre talking about direct conflict as the examples of conflict in your initial post show at the end of the day youre against players who want to just do pve and treat them as if the are irrelevant a csm member has a duty to respect that people dont all want to play in just the way that csm member likes to play

i am sorry that i am not coming across to you clearly all systems need reform eventually the csm is no different reform and restructuring is something i am good at
dear torai have to say i agree with and like a lot of things here i believe your ideas on ganking are somewhat scewed simply increasing punishment on the ganker does not help the person who just lost possibly everything to their name i understand being able to gank is better than nothing but how about changes to help the newbro essentially increasing the time between ganks doesnt help the dead killing an empty pod a station spit out wouldnt remove the taste of loss from my mouthincreasing war dec prices may lower the ammount of wars but this may also hurt that highsec group wanting to fight their rivals or fresh merc groups and so onyou have been my alliance leader a few times now and a reliable friend you are a smart man i agree with your goals but addressing them in a balanced way is the hard partif anything i wrote is outdated i apologise i went over your campaign a few days ago
ill be glad to discuss further on my csm program je serais heureux de dUFFFDbattre au sujet de mon programme pour le csmi will also respond publicly to any questions in english or in french on these forumsje rUFFFDpondrais publiquement aux questions en anglais ou en franUFFFDais sur ce forum
gets my vote i want a eve pinball machine confirming ccp cognac is best cognac
in my csm capacity i have worked alongside mike for approaching two years now and he has been tireless in his work on your behalf i will certainly recommend you all have him high on your ballots come the elections he deserves a third term
hi mikei have questionsconcern about new players and getting them integrated into the game i think most people agree that the quality of a new players eve experience in the game and ultimately the time the stay playing eve depends greatly on the initial social contacts that they make ideally they will shortly after finishing the tutorials end up in a good corp that can not only teach them but support them in the activities they find most enjoyable however getting newbies into the correct corp can be challenging and i am concerned that many new players can end up in small incompetent for lack of a better word or downright exploitative corps which are unable or unwilling to help new players learn the game making their initial eve experience more frustrating so firstly do you think enough is being done to help guide new players into competent corporations that are interested in training new players do you have any ideas on what additional mechanisms could be implemented to help new players find not only a social environment where the thrive but into corporations willing to train and support themsecondly there are upcoming changes in rhea which will facilitate the spamming of new players with corporation invitations and a proposal in the last csm minutes pg 78 to ban intracorp agression in highsec together these will remove two checks on this spamming behaviour that is so prevalent in other games as there will now be zero risk in accepting new players into your corporation this will make a strategy of spam inviting in starter systems to gather new players into an exploitative corp that has excessively high taxes or a low ore buyback program a viable one and one that will have a detrimental effect on the experience of new playersso what can we do to help prevent new players lack of knowledge of game mechanics from being exploited by nefarious or just clueless ceos personally i think this is a strong argument against changing the intracorp aggression mechanics but assuming they go through what can be done to limit the danger of new players ending up in terribleexploitative corps and just quitting the game
i edited his quote so i could focus on the questionsdo i think enough is being done for new players hell no that is why i am in the rookie help chat and why i am organizing operation magic school bus i have said for years that we need to find some way to encourage the corps that actually help new players as opposed to prey on them whether it be by tax breaks some sort of nonisk recognition whatever if we ever manage to make sorp and alliance skins i would say the helpers get theirs firstwhat can we do to help players against nefarious ceos you mean like the ones already spamming in newbie systems to join their corp which has the low low tax rate of 5075 or the ones who set up mining groups for thier own personal sources spam isnt coming it is already here i am of two minds on this one one it is eve and as long as the rules are logical and apparent then some of the burden should be on the players but this is why i agreed with the removal of awox the rule was counterintuitive and dumb so yes ccp should have some very minor protections for new players in the starting and career systems i do think some of the burden alos belongs with the playersbut damn we need a better system to show them there is more than mining and missions to encourage them to be social to make them part of our communitymmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
youll be getting a vote from me mike good luck
all of nullsec both in the cfc and outside of it are pvp areas where anyone may freely engage anyone ratting ships from all sides die routinely as a product of hostile action and such losses are usually accepted and prepared for as part of the risks of living in the area the effort required for solo pve can be minimized just as much whether you are in highsec or nullsec and i would assert that the main factor in balancing the incomes would be the risks players face when operating in each arealarge scale sovereignty warfare moves at a glacial pace you may see it as less risky and thousand man fleets fighting over sovereignty objectives are not an immediate part of the risks facing each sides ratters nullsec sovereignty deals more with alliances fighting at a large strategic scale the risks posed to individuals making an income are more to do with smallgang pvp which can exist anywhere in nullsec smallgang warfare targeting ratters and renters are still very much alive the two powerblocs do it to each other and often support smaller pirate groups operating in each others spacein stark contrast there are far more limited options for directly engaging individuals making an income in highsec individuals can easily evade wardecs suicide ganking has reached the point where only highly organized entities do it regularly it may be a smarter player choice to pve in safer areas but as a matter of having a better game more dangerous areas should be more rewarding relative to highsec features like incursions which give a highlevel of income in highsec break the reward incentive for people to attempt to make money out of lowsec nullsec and wormhole space the incentive for making money in highsec must decrease relative to the incentive for making money in other areas of space if pvp is to have a higher stake in the way individuals have income
actions matter is not the same as conflict there is no conflictminers love to say without us you wouldnt have your shipsmodulesetc these people dont want to have to deal with suicide gankersconflict but they do want to feel like they have an impact on the rest of the game
the first half of the ship tiericide initiative was a mixed bag UFFFD it made new players more powerful in pvp engagements in frigates and cruisers a positive but it also increased cruiser build cost significantly and made it much more crippling for a new player to lose a ship this is a significant issue UFFFD when i was a rookie a vexor cost 6 million isk or about 3 hours of running level 2 missions with low skills and little game knowledge now itUFFFDs 11 million or about 5 hours despite the mineral price index being about the sameand yet you actively support destroying newbie mining ships costing much more than the 11million isk the current cost of a retriever costs about 30 million almost three times as much as the 11 million vexor a low skilled retriever pilot can easily be killed by couple of new order catalysts costing an couple of million isk which is fully reimbursable so just to recap the costs newbie mining pilot 30million isk  about 15 hour grind 35  against sabrizs two new order pilots 2 million isk  reimbursable 0 hrs i guess the guy was a goofus for mining seems ok doesnt itedit newbies and wardecs newbies cannot fly freighters or afford them anyone with those sp and resources is not a newb our primary targets are exhumers a month to train into orcas and freighters multiple months and mining barges as a low priority which still require more sp to sit in than battleships mining barges low priority from code zkillboardexhumers 8384 mining barges 13895edit2 hiasa kite posted 20141206 1815 i think you missed the point that the code csm hopefull doesnt really care about nuturing new players and indeed if a new player mines they are pretty much fair game my experience of the new order is that rather than send a helpful mail offer advice they are more likely to try to send you one to attempt to make you upset so they get get a reply to post on their blog the retriever is the optimal ship for solo mining when you start mining in a procurer you are not using the best ship for solo mining where the procurer shines as you mention is in its defensive capabilities which as you point out is considerable and should be recommended to newer players because there is group of players that specifically target the newbie retriever pilots since when was a retriever considered a suboptimal ship it is a great little ship and indeed the new order along with sabriz adoudel thinks is too good a ship and wants it nerfed
some miners do some dont care theres a significant subset of players who just play for the game mechanics regardless of if they interact with others or not in any way pretending they dont exist or ignoring them completely as an irrelevant is not the way a csm candidate should conduct themselves it shows that if sabriz doesnt agree with your playstyle your opinion no longer matters
salutations dear sabriznew player retention is an issue with this game and our play style can and does effect thisa new player mining in his first retriever very well may quit after his first gank there is also the chance he will be thrilled and excited and maybe curious this all depends on the player and how others interact with him or her many see you as a negative effect on players but do not see all the help you give them any ideas on mechanics that may help them i believe solo ganking is terribly easy on people like this solo new player alone in a belt i feel the best answer is community support on current mechanics and heavier interaction between players but well you know how some people aredon purple
a fully fit venture costs less than 1mil iskthe much more powerful procurer costs 20mil iska low skilled procurer pilot with a 30mil yield fit in a 05 system with prepulled concord requires at least 4 preferably 5 t2 fit catalysts costing about 40mil a fully tanked procurer requires closer to ten remember these are best case scenario numbers for gankers in higher security systems it gets much worsefor mining no for using a suboptimal ship and fit yes
going to vote again for core 1
both sugar and mike will always get my votes i want a eve pinball machine confirming ccp cognac is best cognac
sugar youll get my votes again this yearim not a lowsec player but the community that sugar has fostered as part of her csm9 tenure has made a huge impact on my daytoday enjoyment of eve the number of csm9 members on this thread saying how much work she does for you should send a clear messagemake her your 1 vote not 2 not 5 put her at the top of your list
sugar running for a seat on csm x is great news for all she is easily the hardest working member of csm 9 and will carry this ethos over to csm x with easeregardless of whether you fly in lowsec or not sugar deserves all the votes you can give she is good for the csm which means she is good for you
sugar has my vote
would you care to comment on the tweefleetnet that evenews has just setup and how alot of people on twitter who use tweetfleet are rather annoyed about this
i run en24 not the whole network
what gives with this tweetfleet grab why did you steal an existing vibrant and open community are you really that greedy to think you can establish ownership over something we have all shared freely for so long
i am the owner of tweetfleetnet registered it a few years ago this is a side project of mine you are welcome to go there and postriverini  evenews24 evenews24
that may be the case however en24 is the most visible and public part of the en24 network and you as its editor are rightly associated with your sites wider network and any actions positive or negative that come about so echoing corbexx here what is your take on your employers blatant hijacking of a well used and loved community identity for his own ends
i think the question was would you care to comment not what is your relationship to the siteas you are a csm x hopeful i would too like to hear your views on en24 network attempting to steal the tweetfleet obviously this has made a lot of the community very angry so what do you think about this situation
except the guy who owns the domain is the guy who did it not bobmon and youre all idiots no one stole anything
i know that the team tried to make a site that would support the already existing community thats the reason behind why the name was chosen stealing was never something the team wanted to do support it was their objective the project was also ment to focus on everything in the community and not have an connection to en24 at all excapt same server and a few shared moderator positions moderators position would be givin to those who are known for their work in the communityi always gets sad when the community gets angry what i think about this situation i think it was a good idea to make a new  active forumabout the name they had the intention to help not to steal so it yeah
are you as editor in chief of en24 and part of the en24 network part of that team
hang on im confusedearlier today you put up a tweet which since looks like its been deleted that had explained why you were doing it and that you had put this past some people who thought it was a good idea it was on your twitter account and signed in your name as ceo of en24now in this thread your trying to distance yourself from the sight so in an effort to actually find out what you stand for1 reinstate or put the text of the tweet that has been deleted on this forum2 detail your involvement in the start of this website3 give your personal opinion on what you feel about
longer then a year ago riv approached me with the time i thought it was potentially great for a supporting platform so i went out i guess a year ago with the name under my arm and asked some active users how they felt if somebody would support the already exsiting community with a new forum the reaction i got was positive but we didnt go through it because we had no team to really get it started i myself didnt have enough time so the project was stopped now others approached me with an idea to create a forum and i told them to contact riv riv started up this project and asked my opinion with my previous obtained knoweldge and the concept of supporting the community i said ok i was dragged into a channel and the only thing i did was to make sure that the main focus was still on en24 and not on rivs side project i also tested some early stuff and spent time creating some fun signatures
i had noticed it and felt that i was the one responsable en24 is kinda my baby i showed it to riv and he said no im the guy who they need to talk to not you riv told me to remove it and so i did people started asking me questions in this thread and so i thought it was only fair to respond
as i hope all other csm would do i took over and we will soon change its name have ideas mail me
are you of the eligible age to run for csm i recall hearing youre under the minimum age of 21what does that forum provide that others such as failheap challenge redditcomreve zulu squad and others dontwhy did you and riverini feel the need to tack on the tweetfleet name to a privately owned site that runs ads if you claim you arent stealing the name from the twitter community for eve since you seem to have made a mistake and decided to change the name i can only interpret that this was a poorly thought out project to attach yourself to that has upset members of the eve community
hello tiveand welcome to the discussion thats an interesting question the fake plex though i see where youre coming from is not something i would endorse i imagine more scamming and things of that nature coming out of it mind you im not opposed to people trying their luck at scamming and such i just dont believe a fake plex would help on the other hand i do like that mod idea in a broader sense the idea of there being more decoys or electronics trickery so that information isnt so easy to rely on would be a nice element to further develop in eve this is also an angle that could not only help carebear vs fighter but potentially fighter vs fighter as well naturally ill let someone from the pvp community tell me if theyd have utility for decoys between each other but id imagine they wouldmore to the point though id be fine with a mod that presents itself as a cargo expander but in reality is a lesser form of a bulkheadkudos on the idearl
i fully endorse this person andor serviceseriously how could anyone not vote for this handsome bearded gentleman covered in furs and standing next to a wolfgreat dude and would certainly make for an excellent csm
i believe in fisty
sweet i would love to chat to you when is best for youwhat do you want to do what would be your idea plays if you would do anything whats your idea for hisec lowsec null and wspacewill you listen to people
awesome to see you run fisty you have my vote
catch me in game or pm your comms info and i can come by to chat let me turn that around and ask you what you would like me to do i am not skilled enough to be a game designer so i wont even try that but i can listen to what you have to say
tora u will have my vote i used to fly with u guys a while back as p42alpha you have a very good understanding of the game when i have spoke with you in tseven when i would do some things to really set you offbreak the rules i agreed to when i joined marmite you were very level headed and talked it out and as a leader of a alliance like the one you have you were very personable and from what i could see you enjoyed and took in everyones opinion equally was refreshing coming from 00 learned a lot about eve leadership from you tyi hope the best for you if you do get elected to the csm i feel you will be a great benefit to eve online tell blades i say hello another good dude in marmitethough as small as we are and all exmarmite players our corp will be voting for u but we will still be wding u guys foreverer07 tora

the more you write the more people laugh at you at you not with you its important that youre able to recognize the difference if you expect to be taken seriously this is as true for saeger1737 as it is for you lucasperhaps try to restrict your comments to topics where individuals who havent hurt you are posting that way youll be less inclined to post emotionally and hopefully your words will deserve consideration as opposed to derision
any don purple idea is good you should run for csm i have no problems with my ideas not being the best around and am always willing to listen to better ideas in the end we all want a better eve which way we get there is up to all players in eve not just a small group
brain farts by sweet trader founder of marmites   an autopsy skill that gives you a chance of recovering implants from corpses yesno why   a shared inventory for all charactersalts on linked accounts purchased by the same individual no more trading or shuffling  back and forth from an office yesno why 
yes yes yes yesi think when you pod someone you should have a chance to get 2530 of there implants drop into there corpse
brain farts indeed read lovingly crafted suggestions the second one is a pure quality of life feature we all know what multiboxers do so why make their existence such an unnecessary clickfest if you are in a station with stuff that belongs to any of your accountsalts it should be in the same hangar tora all the way some think hes a character some think he has character im in the second group
1 yes if there is a balancing pass made so implant prices dont collapse if that happened the salvaging of implants will become kinda pointless 2 no i dont think multiboxing needs a buff
hellothank you for having the same passion that many of us share playing this gamei do not agree with you revised ganking procedure eve is not a safe place not even high security systems ganking should not be revised i suggest inserting a new item secure passworded containers items that only capital ships can carry that have an encryption level based on a skill also a decryption skill would be needed in order for them to be opened and it would take say 15 days for a lv 5 decryptor to hack a lv 5 encrypted containerpeople should not be more baby treated they should organize themselves when transporting valuables in high sec and not afk freight 15 billions of stuff simple as thatplus the stations will spit you out if you gank is just pointless stations have always been and always should be the only safe place for pods and ships maybe not charactersi do not agree on a afk timer for cloackers but we need a system to counter macrobotting this should be not done through change in ingame mechanics but should be adressed by ccp internally with some monitor programthe mining boredom is a problem i would make it more profitable but more challenging changing the mining ships in a way that requires them to be dynamically managed adding content making mining belts casinospeople that want to avoid wardecks can stay in npc corp the current system ensures only the best business models survive generating stronger more coordinated and cohese entities the current wardeck system works just finepeople should not be forced in leaving npc corp it is a good aggregator and many people use them for various purposesthe industry changes i approve ofempire poses should simply have a limitation on defences that are possible to fitsorry but you do not have my vote especially because of the changes you propose to high secr
the incentive for making more isk is the same every where so i assume you mean the means rightlook we can play this point counterpoint all day because you missed what i was saying i am not trying to ruin or even change your gameplay when we discuss ways of making isk but i in return ask the same do not look to nerf someone else to make your own situation be better look to improve your own space make it attractiveit is like real estate    graffiti on the next block over might make yours look better relatively but it is a downward spiral and in the end few want to live anywhere nearby if we make highsec untenable then we block a distinct portion of the game population who have no want or need to go to low or null that hurts the whole game make your space better    not by making someone elses space worse but by actually making your space better as a result the whole game will benefitmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
what i am saying is that areas outside of highsec must be more attractive for making isk relative to highsec if we dont want the game to devolve into esports where players and groups can easily recover losses in the safezone of highsec groups like cfc and the new order actively attempt to disrupt highsec economic activity because we understand the impact that the wealth it produces has on the rest of the game if capital pilot owners on both sides mine in highsec or run incursions would it not be in our interest to disrupt and hurt such activities if producers in highsec are in direct economic conflict with our own industrialists would it not be in our interest to slaughter them enmass conflict comes to highsec because it is connected to every area of the game if the humble highsec miner mission runner incursion runner or industrialist who do not want to leave highsec were not in economic competition with the rest of the game you would certainly see less effort put into their extermination
doubtful its one thing for miniluv or code to target known logistics alts and alt corps of enemy power blocs its quite another to massacre every freighter that enters a pipe system even if nullsec was far and away the best place to do industry you would still see people doing it in highsec and you would still kill them so your argument is pointless justification but that is to be expected from james 315s followers
mike i always have fun talking with you feel like i can approach you with any of my ideas i think are worth doing more than just throwing at a wall to see what sticks and when we disagree on things you can articulate your point to even someone as hard headed and opinionated as me1 for mikes continuation on csm 1 for letting mike continue to use the developed relationships and skills to be an effective part of csm
i see mike as one of the more active csm on the forums soliciting opinions and visibly reading and responding to feedback threads i dont regret voting for mike in the past and ill vote for him again despite his being a horrid dirty carebeargiven these conditions if players were avoiding activity in dangerous space due to rewards not stacking up to the efforttimerisk  when players would otherwise enjoy activity in that space including hazards i believe players generally gravitate to the most optimal method for an activity regardless of fun factor  when making changes would probably cause players who would prefer to play there to move there  when making changes would not cause safer space to have inoptimal rewards for efforttimerisk for those who would prefer to remain and when changes would create additional or more enjoyable pvppiracy encounters for everyone who desires such gameplay i feel making more targets move to this dangerous space would be a good goal because its adding to the entertainment value of the game by presenting more engaging options for those who want to take themthats not reason for simply nerfing the better options though its a hypothetical circumstance that may justify a certain goal i imagine theres many paths to achieving the goal and by taking the most obvious nerfing something youre possibly ignoring more effective or less disruptive optionsi think itd be ideal to have any given activity have about equal viablity in all areas of the game for example shooting red plus signs pete might like lowsec belt ratting over running highsec missions but before the clone tags were introduced pete only ran missions because he when belt ratting he felt he was wasting his time now with mordus rats and clone tags pete flies around lowsec belts and enjoys his pve hours more than before pete sometimes runs into pies but even with the bother and the hazard the isk is more worth his time nowe uh wow that last bit has nothing to do with whats quoted i guess i wanted it in there as a positive example of making space more appealing to people who might want to play there
i endorsed mike for csm 8 on a long shot  i didnt think he had all that good a chance of getting elected but i thought it was definitely worth trying to help an advocate for the little guys of eve get elected because i believe that a csm with a diverse range of experience and viewpoints is a stronger more effective csmmike repaid that that endorsement a hundred times over in csm8 and then gave us an encore for csm9 the argument that the individual the loner the casual needs a representative is as strong as ever and mikes proven ability to speak up effectively for that constituency and his two terms of experience in delivering that voice make him an inarguable choice for the role i strongly urge you to find a place on your preferences for mikevote mike azariah
what a joke this is about as funny as your campaign on ganking incursion runners probably end up about as successfulalso per your comment in toras threadout of game  hes absolutely positively someone the csm needs and will probably receive second maybe third place on my recommended how to vote listyou sure sound full of yourself even have a recommended how to vote list for the sheepjust another  trying for some eve fame
thankyou for supporting sabrizs campaign by bumping the thread
in addition to helping create a stereotype of what his opponents are like
you have my votes
sugar kyle running for reelection is fantastic news and was the primary current council seat i was hoping to hear would return given the chance everyone who has kept up with the work csm 9 has done knows that sugar has been absolutely exemplary of what the eve community and ccp could ever hope to have as a council membervote and keep her very high on the ballet if not the 1 vote that is so clearly deserved its not only a vote lowsec it is a vote for eve online itself to be a great as it can be
since you openly admit to being the man in charge of gia the goon intelligence agency how do you think ccp can stop people from doxxing other players for the meta game part of eve as the leader of gia why do you support efforts of members of the gia in their doxxing efforts also what is your activity level how often do you actually log in to play
why are you running for a csm seat with an alt and not your main character
endie is a good person and i like the ideas he is behind
if you try and read the last part of hes post you see that he dont own the real endie character
i answered this already on this page about two posts ago but let me say again i dont doxx people none of my gia people dox anyone i have nothing to do with such activitiesas i said on reddit when you asked me the same thing since nothing has changedi dont want to do anything to anyone in eve which id not be happy about them doing to me and i would hate to get doxxed ergo i think doxxing people is  unpleasant and if you want to look at it in totally detached lawl meta terms it is also stupidly counterproductiveedit the nastiest thing i do is make rude jokes about people and god knows they do the same thing right back to me
i answered this in the op i play eve a lot whether in mainfleet midsized eg stuff or roaming with bat country in small gangs again as i explained in the op i dont own the character endie nor have i ever since quite a lot of people know who i am as endie and not by the name of any of my 20odd eve characters i decided to make a character that clearly identified me so that there was no confusion
when it comes down to potential csms i think the most important factor in any sort of evaluation is passion when you have someone who is head of one of the games biggest fansites the passion is undeniably there ideas and campaign promises are interesting but the csm arent junior game designers hes got the passion hes got the motivation to work with the community and he knows how the game works pretty good combo if you ask me
met bobmon  saw the passions love the person defo a awsome candidUFFFDte
u awesome sir have my vote 
ive known bob for a few years now hes a good honest guy whos got my vote go for it bob
bobby has the mental age of stephen hawking thus superior to yoursobviously it provides space for the readers of en24 to voice their opinion and the writers space to get feedback from their own readers as to what theyd like to see more of in future articlessurely if the name has been changed it means that he does not wish to create drama and would rather have a compromise than upset the player base something one would hope to have in a future csm member bobmon for csm
sure why not
does this not make this whole topiccampaign pointless if he is not old enough to run
whats your opinion on rlmls and hmls
rlmls were nerfed a little bit too hard hmls need either an application or range buff since they are currently pretty useless for pvp purposes
youll be happy to know its not going to matter after tomorrow nektor clone costs are going away as is sp loss on death with the exception of t3 cruisers they still have a skill loss
steve has been invaluable on csm9 and i strongly endorse him for csmx he has been a pleasure to work with and his feedback has been vital in solving many of the current issues in the game
you stance against gankers and wanting your mining vessel to have a 50 win chance eliminates you as a serious candidateyou are in a pve ship facing someone who fitted his ship for the single purpose of killing you if you fit for the sole purpose of tanking his damage can he still solo gank you while making a profitwhat makes you a better candidate to vote for as mike azariah or sugar kyletheir goal is to improve eve for everyone your goal seems to be improving eve for carebears while nerfing gameplay of people that are not you
thank you for taking the time to read my campaign threadwhat do war decs have to do with gankers other than code seem to have a war dec thing starting upi do not want to make myself immune to it i think i already mentioned a couple of times in the thread words to the effect of i am not campaigning for a theme park eve because ccp will never make onefor examplegive me the tools to keep me safeallow me to decide to use them or take the risk not tothe new player experience does not as it stands prepare new players also new carebears for life in eve ive played through the tutorials on more than one alt and there was nothing there about dscan there was nothing there about how to fit a ship according to the current theories and trends for pvp or pve there wasnt even anything like a friendly nudge in the right directionok you could say that google is your friend but there are enough of us care bears out there that have not mastered the intricacies of efficient internet searching how about for example an evemail automatically for every new character firstly introducing the new guy to the functionality or presence of evemail that has a couple of helpful links wikis eve uni stuff that a new guy might like to readpress the information into the hands of us carebears then see what we do with it if we do nothing then that is our choicefault but it ought to be a choice and just trying to google eve brings up a lot of old information and information of dubious qualityand i believe that i have also said that i would love to have the caldari navy intelligence secure self destruct module that is 995 guaranteed to destroy my ship all mods all cargo et cetera it is of course an active mod but if i am not afk or dicking around i can make sure that those gankers dont get their hands on my shinies
the marmite name makes everyone look for the hidden agendai wont vote for tora simply because of his stance against afk cloaking afk cloakers are an annoyance but the only thing i think of is me being trapped in a deadend system unable to jump out because there is a gatecamp and unable to log off because hostiles have probes outand then i have to set an alarm clock every 20 minutes to prevent losing my ship and implantsi will accept an end to afk cloaking if they will introduce a way to log off safely without getting killed
i knew i took a risk here as marmites isnt the most loved alliance in game but people who know me well also know that i can set aside my personal issues and go for the bigger picturei dont see why you cant log off after you timer has run out 
and im certain that players like yourself slapping their knees and laughing at me matter to me oh so muchim not posting positionally you leaping in to launch personal attacks at me in defense of your beloved tora would seem to be an emotional response here tora claiming that someone pointing out reasons he would make a bad csm representative is off topic is an emotional response tora has never hurt me a useless person sitting around in highsec running a corporation which is amounts to griefing new players and supporting gevlon goblin is hardly going to have an effect on a high level trader and industrialist operating primarily out of nullsec i post in this thread because i oppose the campaign and will voice my opinions wherever i wish if you dont like that tough go cry to someone else about it or dont who really caresthe fact that youre in marmite is neither here nor there the fact that your campaign here is terrible and anyone having read posts by you or your alter ego general lemming knows that what spills out of your head is pure unfiltered garbage is what will put most people off of voting for you
i think youre confusing multiboxing to having more then one character active which can happen on the same account
if this change were to be used why would a new skill be needed as opposed to the hacking skill its already a rather unused and untapped skill that only pve players usei like the concept but the idea of adding a whole new skill when there are many redundant and useless skills already isnt necessary just make hacking v to be the minimum to revert an offline tower
corbexx csm best csm
i also endorse corebexx for csm
easily the greatest and most active csm member i have ever met keep up the good work and you have my vote for reelection
although corbexx and i dont necessarily agree on new features or how things should be implemented i have found him to be a strong voice and trustworthy representative of the space that i grew up in i still keep a close eye on wh space and i havent seen another wh representative during my time playing who really does deserve the players voteskeep on with the amazing work youve been doing and expect a vote from this player in the upcoming elections
mike azariah is one of my most very favourite people in all of new eden and thats before i even take into account the amazing work he has contributed to csm9 you should vote for him  i will be
much of the iskhr that high sec activity can generate is because high sec is the beating heart of the eve economy would you agree that part of the problem with nullsec income in particular isnt just the risk but the fact that its a nearly pure isk faucet that hardly requires any interaction with other playersand their wallets given that a neckpunch to high sec might just bring the whole games economy to its knees wouldnt it be better to figure out how to get players to interact profitably if you could get the isk transferisk injection ratio in null sec to roughly the same proportion that mission running enjoys in high sec that would be a huge buff to null sec income but with the same or less isk injectedunfortunately that would be a very tall order but do you think that its the right track or do you have a better idea
1 vote from me every little bit helps
man you ask think questions with a lot of layersto the first part no null does make a fair amount of isk in their own space they just dont talk about it as much so null is not the impoversished waif some make it out to beit would be better to help players interact but as i have said before not force them to do so there are some players who take solace in quietly mining or running missions i know i am at times one of them to gut highsec would not move players to other regions some it would move to other gamesas for the last part i wrote a huge paragraph and then realized i was tapdancing too close to my nda boundaries for my own taste but i can say in more general terms that a lot of commonly held beliefs of how things are in eve are based on faulty premisesbut back to my key point i do not want to ruin one space to benefit another each space should have its own draw and its own reason to be theremmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
ok i promised to respond more in detail to this when i had time so ill do so nowpve content in highsec is currently designed to be grindbased and fairly low player interaction anomalies are the most competitive content in highsec but they have their rewards tuned so low that noone runs themwith the exception of quite new players this leads to an environment where pve stops being about can i succeed at this mission and instead becomes about how can i most quicklyefficiently succeed at this mission efficiency becomes everything and pve does not remain interesting once you get efficiency focusedfundamentally this comes down to the fact that player opponents are dynamic and unpredictable while npc opponents are static and predictable even where npcs have very high stats such as the burner missions it all comes down to learning an established efficient way to beat them and doing soadd in competition with other players not necessarily starship combat and this becomes a very different equation look at how terrible the pve aspect of factional warfare is  kill one rat orbit a beacon kill the rat when it respawns then sometimes shoot a structure this utterly terrible pve content entertains thousands of players because of the involvement of other playersthere is a form of conflict available in incursions via the mechanics for contested sites but the stakes are just too low for contests to matter much if your fleet loses a site contest you incur no real cost and only a hundred million or so in opportunity costs you can also quite easily determine who will be likely to win before a contest happens and if you assess that you cant win a contest you usually just warp out of the site and go and do another onesome rough ideas of what player conflict driven pve content in highsec could look like from lowest to highest level of pvp add level 5 security missions to highsec but have them take place in deadspace areas where concord only responds to pvp aggression towards pods not towards ships unlike lowsec l5s you will need to be scanned down to be attacked in lowsec you can be attacked on gates or undocks as well a new type of mission agent that give missions only once per thirty minutes at a set time everyone gets the same mission in the same deadspace pocket these missions are designed in such a way that a limited number of people can succeed at them  perhaps you have to land a killing blow on an elite battleship npc and there are only three of them in the site or perhaps you have to collect a particular dog tag or cargo item penalties for failure are purely isk no standings loss and are at a level that irritates not a level that cripples  new types of anomalies that always offer escalations however anyone else doing these anomalies in the constellation or region will also get the same escalation concord will not respond to pvp aggression in the escalation site new anomalies that always offer escalations however the escalations always occur in lowsec regionwide events where at unpredictable times an npc fleet fight takes place and players can join in on the side of their choice and have the right to shoot both players and npcs fighting for the other side
sounds like your ideas pretty much boil down to replace pve with pvp and make places where i can gank without concord getting involvedwhat you fail to understand is that some people like pve not pvp better ideas will be around making pve more engaging without turning it into pvp the second you try to make it more engaging by adding pvp conflict you fundamentally miss the reasons people enjoy pve its certainly possible for npc based content to be challenging it needs to simply be less formulaic and require more on the spot thought from a player
shes talking about adding stuff that will lead to pvppve hybrid situations thats not replacing pve i really cant see why anyone would object to adding stuff like that nobody will be forced to run them they merely add another imo interesting option
this tax already applies if you care to run a site youll see a piece getting taken by corp tax if anything this encourages people to create tax haven one man corpsi think players dont join corps and stay fighting for them is mostly because of the effort to organise for game play they dont generally enjoy
because its all an attempt to gradually move pve into pvp im sure that the arguments would be made that because its pvp thus more risk that it should then be more rewarding then traditional pve would be left behind to rot and lets face it the last attempt at hybrid pvepvp was fw and that got abused by people ganking their alts and is now pretty much dominated by double stabbed plexingthe objection i have is that sabriz has absolutely no intention of accepting the existence of pve players its in the op pve players dont want pvp what they want is more engaging pve why should those players be ignored so players who want to pvp can have more hybrid content created for them
perhaps you have some suggestions for sabriz on how to make pve more engaging in my eyes players who only want to pve already have quite a few options but by its nature pve always becomes optimized and grindy incursions and wormhole sites were designed to be very challenging but even they have been figured out and reduced to an efficiency game and yes wh sites do have an element of pvpso how would you make pve more engaging  without including player interaction sabriz has some ideas of her own but one of the most important traits of a csm candidate is being able to listen to and identify good ideas from the community what is yourswant to talk join my channel in game house forelli
while the first part of your reply is a bit of slippery slope argument sabriz seems to be voicing a reasonable position she is saying that since eve is a singleuniverse competitive sandbox any new pve content should be designed with fostering this competition and the emergent gameplay that results from it you are welcome to disagree but it doesnt seem to me that sabriz is proposing anything especially egregious now there are arguments about where best limited development resources should be spent  on more solo pve content which according to ccp the majority of these consumers quit the game quite quickly or on more interactive content and game mechanisms that promote social interactions and thus player retention however that is really a ccp business decision which requires information that i lack to make any solid conclusions
the simplest way would be adding more variation so figuring out pve is more difficult because its dynamic take for example missions they are made up of static waves of npcs from static triggers instead give each wave a set of points and randomise the npcs where tougher npcs cost more points add the need to engage in ecm and counterlogistics to rats and its already miles ahead of where it currently isive played more games that i could possibly try to count and many of them have very engaging offline modes its certainly possible to achieve without needing to add pvpanother important trait of a csm candidate is accepting that not everyone plays eve for the same reasons you do it seem pretty obvious that sabriz has absolutely no respect for players with gameplay styles which arent focused around pvp the op even goes so far as to suggest that a certain subgroup of players simply dont existslippery slopes arent always wrong suggesting they are is to suggest that changes would never occur as a precursor to further changes in the same direction and while all content should have levels of competition making it so that new pve content forces you to move to an area when you can be ganked without concord protection certainly doesnt seem like the right way to go about it to be honest it sounds like im running out of targets and want a new mechanic that allows me to kill more people who dont want to fight yes many of those people quit the stats from fanfest in fact show that around half of new players leave eve within a month of those that remain 10 go into group content and 40 move into solopve content put another way if 75 or less of players who stay more than a month but move into solopve content leave they they are still above or on par with the number of players who stay for group content even if none of the latter group leave highly unlikelynow to me this would be an indicator to devote time to making pve more engaging considering pve gets very little work and mechanics like mining have been the same dull gameplay for pretty much ever it would seem its long overdue obviously there are players joining who like that experience so pretending they do not exist and focusing on yet more pvp zones would seem to be a bit backwards
ok sure but if you frame it that way then any attempts to add mechanics that promote more interaction or competition between players is an attempt to gradually move pve into pvp even mike azariah agrees that ccp should be spending development time on increasing the mechanisms facilitating group and player interaction i see no problem adding new optional pve content that is more rewarding but has additional risks such as but not limited to reducedno concord its essentially just a proposal to bring a bit of lowsec into a specific highsec context eve is all about risk vs reward and lowsec or this hypothetical new mechanic pve should be more rewarding perhaps you are right and more people would stay if the pve would massively revamped however eve is not a singleplayer pve game it is a sandbox where social interactions both competitive and cooperative are paramount ccp seems to have recognized that and everything ccp seagull has said points to development being focused on a more playercontrolled playerdriven eve universe in the future so i doubt you are going to see any significant solo pve content ever again even if a complete revamp was done which for mining might happen eventually it will be to make it more group orientated and competitive not make it more solofriendly and isolationisti am not saying you are wrong in your views  you like what you like  but you appear to be fighting an uphill battle against the direction eve is moving youve made it clear that sabriz isnt your candidate but i am not sure you are going to find many other csm candidates that share your view that eve development resources should be spent on expanding eve solo content over group content nor even if you did would the developers listen to that csm member
sure adding more social tools and if you noticed he mentioned pure pve activities for that too is generally a good idea i strongly believe that people would work together on pve if everything wasnt stacked against doing so many games give bonuses to working in groups eve simply splits the rewards so theres really no benefit in working together more tools for collaboration all round is a good idea the real difference is though that mike accepts there are players who like to play solo and that its ok to do soeve is a game for all types and to be honest whatever seagull says the game needs players to accomplish anything some players like to play without combat if they are going to simply write those people off then it really doesnt matter whos csmim not saying that solo content necessarily needs to be a focus but it certainly needs to be accepted as part of the game and noncombat content will always be required and certainly needs love sabrizs ideas amount to add more places to gank people who dont want to be attacked seem to be pretty selfish in design like i said before a csm candidate needs to be trusted to look out for the needs of the community not just their own
there is definitively no such thing as people that play without impacting the rest of the gamethere are definitely people that think they dont affect anyone else the ore they produce the meta and faction modules they add to the economy  these people turn the tide of wars would goonswarm have defeated test if phased muon sensor disruptor i cost ten million isk not 25 million it would cost ten million or more without career highsec mission grindersif people want to experience pve content completely sheltered from other players actions  they already can do so on the test server where surprise pvp is completely banned however these players do not want to do so because when they do so they also lose their ability to impose their actions upon other players through the marketi started as a carebear player levelling up my dominix had i not been shaken out of that i would have definitely left eve the server structure enforces a 1 second tick needed to support fleet fights which when combined with inertia mechanics removes any prospect for a fast action feel in combat in the game for those reasons eves pve will always be slower paced and can never manage to be as engaging as the pve found in games like path of exile that are designed for pve first and foremostfinally eve is not a game for all types it never has been so many of its fundamental design decisions  real loss pvp extremely high productive capacity to fuel all of that destruction making sure that low level ships remain useful to experienced players and more  all of these are designed to push eve down a very different path to other games there have been many pveoriented games with better pve than eve that have gone broke

i did however the response i got was that they couldnt get into it because they are not allowed to say bad things about other csm members only nice things something sensitivity training something that is why i am asking why they are not endorsing you do they have nothing nice to say or do they just not want you on their teamlike you have none
you have my vote again thanks for all the work you did this past year and hopefully you get a chance to get back at it in 2015
sugar has been arguably the hardest working member of csm9 in my opinion while she has been a massive credit to those lowsec pilots who elected her sugars views on other areas of the game have been invaluable her work on the minutes was also frankly staggering an easy endorsement
as a player who started eve around the same time as sugar i have found no other players voice that stands closer to my own on so many different areas and aspects of the game the impact sugar has had on eve not only since becoming a member of the csm has easily earned her my vote again keep up the great work sugar 
so then when the issue of one player collecting posting and sharing the personal information of other players was brought to light and it seemingly has become a recurring theme with different examples cited each time what do you feel is the appropriate response to curb that behaviordo you think it crosses the line into real life harassment that ccp have reinforced their policy on recently and should be condemned do you feel its an internal cultural issue with that players organization and the us vs them at any cost mentality that same player cites as his rationale do you feel that is a healthy aspect of the community that 50 of the sov holders have towards the gameclearly people are linking you to the actions of digi and his usage of collecting other players personal out of game information this is clearly due to the gia which you openly state you are the head of and thus are perceived to be the cause of these actsin the spirit of supporting the metagame what do you think ccp can do both mechanically ingame and policy wise to limit the inherent danger joe the gamer can experience out of game by someone like that without neutering the ability to prevent enemies ingame from committing acts such as the ones that destroyed band of brothers etc it is clearly the fear of being destroyed from the inside that caused those acts of doxxing to occurplease dont fall into the fallacy of thinking this is taking pot shots at you as some people tend to resort to when these questions are raised to them im genuinely curious how you see this issue and how you would go about fixing it
i think that if someone has their private personal details released without their permission then yes that sounds like real life harassment and if ccp feel brave enough to enforce that then i would entirely welcome them doing so of course someone could ruleslawyer that with specious what if hard cases but i hope that im being pretty clear on the principle i think that ive been extremely clear on my distaste for such practisespersonally i can only remember this happening once in the last couple of years but that once was too often and i hugely regret that it was by my allianceif ccp assigned some unique numeric id to each player and made it a stronglyenforced contractual term that you do not attempt to register with more than one such id and made public the characters linked to that numeric id then that would do what the counter intel guys do but that would be such a huge and dramatic shift in the nature of eve that i am not sure that the playerbase would accept it and it would certainly strip away most of the backstabbing convoluted spying metagame that draws many people to eve in the first place i suspect that it would also not be even 80 effectivebut lets be clear the spying metagame does not justify doxxing it explains why counterintel people try to find out if a given friendly character is owned by the same person as a hostile character every major nullsec power has to do this to survive but it does not justify publishing those details so finding out that manny was flying a titan for a cfc alliance and blowing it up thats an ingame consequence and entirely fine publishing some of his details just to show off that it was him totally and utterly out of lineim not at all annoyed and those are very fair questions given that most of eve probably thinks that mittani still runs the gia something he happily encourages people to think it is not surprising that plenty of them think that digi has something to do with it i imagine some cfc members doin fact digi is not in the gia and his only interaction with our agents is when he bans them and i have to tell him to leave them alone and unban them because they are our brave patriots fighting the dastardly enemy in his fiendish underhanded war
all my dealings with endie in the game or out combined with the writing on his blog makes me entirely confident that he would be a superb candidate for csm you have my vote mate
thank you for those answers
greetings  salutations i am manfred sideous and i hope to earn your vote for the council of stellar management i have been playing eve online for the better part of a decade i love this game and the people that play it and care greatly for the health and well being of this game and its community i have participated in so many cool events  wars  conflicts and made so many wonderful friendships from this community i have traveled thousands of miles to attend weddings of players who met from this very game i like to think that eve is a giant epic drama unfolding before our eyes but instead of watching it we get to participate in it and shape it no other game can rival eve online in how immersive and epic it is i agree that eve can only grow and get bigger i agree that we are still in the early years of eve and i fully intend to be part of this game for a very long time to comewho is this guyi am currently a member of the pandemic legion and a fleet commander and campaign commander in the service of the legionemployment history  things of noteroyal fleet auxiliary service  tash murkon based mining corporationfirmus ixionoutbreakrequiemtriumvirateminor threatagainst all authoritiescascade imminentpandemic legionthings ive done or been part offix easter egg defence 1  2
nullsec industry not all things should begin and end with jita what if there were a better way for nullsecrs i think nullsec industry boost would be great for nullsec and the game overall it would also lead to more reasons for players being in space doing things like collecting and harvesting materials and resources those people will be hunted so they will need people protecting the area this gives lots of new meaningful things for attackers and defenders to do that actually make a real difference also this strengthens the need of nonpvprs to be included in nullsec as currently 99 of players recruited by nullsec groups are pvprs allowing more dynamic playstyles is a good thing for everyone in nullsec lowsec why is it that high security space has all the bells and whistles and you lot are left with your hands empty what if there was a way to offer great services to builders  refiners and researchers for a fee creating a system where customers could purchase benefits and protection from faction warfare they pay a fee and purchase standings to the local fw or the ability to use speedy facilities or efficient facilities that are better than what they can get in high security space now fw have a vested interest in protecting customers or thwarting off wouldbe attackers or raiders also gives fw a reason to want to expand territories to have a bigger market share of business because business  isk into pilots pocketsnote  i ran for csm9 but due to usa immigration i didnt have my passport in time i have spoken with ccp in great detail via petition to make sure i was in fact a valid candidate for csm 10
some articles  posts  interviews i have taken part inhere is doink who produces sht on kugu
upswagged
youve got my vote boss
third yay manny eve down under  australian eve community wwwevedownundercom
manny will be an amazing csm
was sad to hear you werent able to run for csm 9 glad to see youre running for csm 10 when your insight into sov warfare is most needed
you got my vote
as much as i love what you talk about in your platform and hope that you make it onto the council my votes are already spoken for with sugar kyle purely for her accessibility as a candidate best of luck
good eve player that knows his stuff1010 would br again
one of the better leaders in eve and knows his dual pane idea click
sweet and lovable guy who is known as the butcher of titansdefinitely someone who can advocate positive changes to improve the sandbox oriented gameplay
one of my main concerns is ship balance and id like to learn more about your thoughts on it as someone who flies t3s in a routine fashion id like to hear you would balance t3s id also like to know how you believe ishtars are overpowered do you think that sentries should be looked at as well
this is a great campaign and im sure youll get my voteout of curiosity why do you believe shield is under powered compared to armor when most major doctrines tengus and ishtars seem to be mainly shield is that due to the bomb driven meta or because of another shortcoming thats not coming to mind
why do you prefer an occupancy based sov over a freeform sov approach do you really want to see defensive mining fleets 
what is your view on competitive pvp in eve at neo some kind of dojowhere do you see eve in a year regarding competitive gameplay
what is your favorite childrens toy to step on in the middle of the night while walking through a hallway
needs more swaggerwhat are your perspectives towards the sov warfares future and any ideas to improve it
1 for an actual bomber rebalance would love to hear your suggestions on how to bring the little buggers back in line
skilled player who would get my vote too
how do you balance the learning experience for new players whilst also teaching them that eve is a rough place and they shouldnt particularly expect it to be fairwhat would you do to make it so that n1 isnt the easiest way to win fleet fights e how would your sov system work wrt to timers and sov structures what would you do to actually encourage people to live in sov null do you have any ideas on npc null and lowsec that isnt fw what would you do to encourage pvp in hisec  and possibly make it a viable home for people in the long term
t3s as they stand are better than bs  hac  command ships they dominate fights as they do most thing very well all at once i am not a game designer but it feels like they do too much well at once tank  speed  sig  dps  dps application please point to a hac  bs  bc hull that can do all of the above other than the ishtar i am not quite sure what to do with the ishtar either but its still pretty op i think maybe reducing the dronebay size is the answer
pretty much the ishtar and tengu still have lower sig because of the hull size and they are extremely kitey making bombing them much harder the bomb meta is cancer on fleet tactics you dont see alpha fleet you dont see missile boats like ravens or navy scorps the high sig of shield comps makes them a instant non starter
bs get bombed and have terrible mobility hacs are generally speaking fairly flimsy and command ships are a messdont you think these issues should be addressed before what i would hope to be a reasonable t3 rebalance
i think occupancy based is great and will allow so many different approaches to conquest and defense why would there be defensive mining fleets i am gonna take a stab and say you are saying defensive mining ops would be utilized to maintain indexes for occupancy based sov yeah i dont think anyone wants mandatory and tedious mining fleets
i love the alliance tourney i would like to see more tourneys i participated in the past at on the pl team on my alt paik  the eos that lived in structure  unfortunately the problem with eve is its kinda niche and im not sure its viable for esports i wish it was i dont really have a answer but ill be listening for the guygirl who does have the answer
stuffed animals of course
i think in regards to new players that perhaps a week or so in a noobie friendly area would be great completely insulated from the rest of eve most games have a noobie area which is focused on helping new players learn about the actual game and its mechanics once they have the time to learn this push them out of the nest new players should be able to opt out sooner if they want new player retention is one of the biggest hurdles for ccp with the changes to power projection and further changes with sov you will start to see fights become more localized with less outsiders intervening numbers will always be a huge factor in fights and there is no way that i know of to change that so to be clear i dont have the smoking gun answer but what i do have is a ton of knowledge and experience in this game i plan to use that to help ccp develop or find the possible smoking gun but in regards to why would people want to live in nullsec risk vs reward and carrots should be the driving principles you cant force players to do anything however you can incentivize the thing you want them to do and not make it painful and they will do it yea i think there have been a bunch of good ideas on npc nullsec the ones i like alot is that inhabitants that do things for the faction get added benefits similar to some of the benefits you get from holding sov hisec pvp i am not really sure i think people that arent interested in pvp mainly reside in hisec so honestly i would just listen for good ideas for this area
1ing in a vote manny thread
1 for mannythe best man for the job
all of my account votes are belong to youa good man who actually knows his stuff
manny is already deserving member of the eve community having him as member of csm will only improve his contributions for the beneft of all
whats your stance on lowsec why do you want to take more power away from pirates and into fw hands what do you think about fw lp stores and how they affect every other lp store do you think there should be variance in which lp store offers what
mannyyou had me at hellogo get em big fella
if i had more than one account youd get a vote from me as it is i wish you all the best in securing a csm seat i suspect you wont have any problem doing that
i would not mind if t3s lost 1015 dps and 2025 tank in exchange for ccp making the rest of the non standard subsystems no complete garbage plus if they get that kind of nerf i feel the skillpoint loss will need to go also recons need to be fixed because they are complete trash right now and hacs need another balance pass most of em are garbageanother thing in regards to bombers i dont think a rebalanced will do bombing in its current form has to go because in a game that kind of is about blobbing anti blob weapons have no place otherwise why did titan guns get nerfd beyond reason ccp is fairly inconsistent in their balancing and its hurting the game
ass we can
in your opinion1 what is currently broken about lowsec2 how would you fix it3 how do you see lowsec fitting into the universe as a whole going forwardyour post mentions something about fw but there is more to lowsec than fw
my csm
what are your thoughts on the relationship between cruisers and battlecruisers and battleships ever since the warp speed changes this game has become very cruiser heavy coupled with the buffs in the cruiser rebalance it seems that anything larger is irrelevant in todays game exception being drone based ships cough domi cough that can project damage on any size target up and down the spectrum of courselooking at battlecruisers do you feel that bcs are in need of improvements what would you change about them if nothing why notlooking at bs do you feel that bss are in need of improvements what would you change about them if nothing why noti have been around for a while and recall the good days where bcs and bss and cruisers all played an integral role in fleet make ups bc  cruisers  bs  bc it was a nice little food chain that demanded intel on enemy fleets so you could effectively counter what they were bringing to the field today 23rds of that chain are broken and we are left with cruisers trying to counter cruisersand due to the nature of that you see a perceived imbalance in ships namely t3s or the king of range dictating the ishtardo you think it is t3s and ishtars that are the problem or could it infact be that presently there is no bigger fish in the pond worth using to snuff them out or a little from column a a little from column b
good luck manny i hope you get a seat
manfred is in my top 2 list
7 votes from me m8
you have my sword etc
hi manny i thought you were a great candidate last year sure you will get in and be great one note of caution however remember the wormhole t3 meta needs to be kept in mind and is not the same as the null t3 meta i would suggest that nerf the crap out of everything is not the right answer there either would you call for instance an armor tanked ecm tengu op at that level i wouldnt but yet it is a very common wormhole fit author of interstellar privateer shattered planets wormholes and game commentary
no your legion harbors members that scam newbros in recruitment channels not cool manny not cool
im going to vote the  out of manny easily the most qualified csm of any candidate running so far
newbro 12m sp
lolim sure manny will surely be able to dictate to each corp in pl how they are not allowed to make their own policies on things like scamming
that scam was perpetrated in a private convo ccp allow you to do that they dont allow scams to be don inside the recruitment channelsecondly if we are going to define a 12million sp pilot with a nearly 1billion isk ship as a newbro then im an adorable newbie and should be free from being pvpdedit  also lmao at you thinking manny isnt fit to be on csm because people in his alliance use valid mechanics ccp openly support and even warn players about
 the newbros
lol you think its about you or your recruitment scams or particular details of this scam no my friend its not its about something biggerits about creating and exploiting wedges in the community right now i opened up a wedge  manfreds tolerance of scamming now if someone on say evenews24com or tmc picks this up they are going to ask him a question  whats his stance on recruitment scams in his organizationhe has three answers1 he supports it result  alienates half the normal people who will consider him nothing better then a code scumbag or a goon scammer lost votes others will spin this against him he loses the election again frankly if he does support it then he is no different from code scammers are scammers all the same2 he fluffs the answer and appears weak and indecisive other candidates will exploit this at a minimum noone likes evasive politicians3 he says he is against he will have to throw you under the bus of course or at least that dude of yours to make a show of commitment this will have a positive effect on his image and differentiate him from goon and other scamming candidates lots of potential for good spin heretake it from me i was senior campaign manager for several ontario provincial elections i know how this  worksedit  oh lol look at this in time it took me to type this already 3 posts defending recruitment scams one questioning manfreds ability to enforce rules across his organization and one post got edited definitely a wedge and definitely worthy of further note by journalists
do you have real world medical training to determine that these people are normal and that anyone who supports ingame scamming which the developers of this game do are abnormaltake it from me im an international lawyer and you can be sued for libel over this statement
man such a puppetmaster truely manny is crumbling before your mightalternatively lol nerd no one cares
erotica 1 vs rippard tegwhite knights winggkeep fanning the flames though more posts and reposts the better
perhaps depends if this gets picked up and fanned by manfreds rivals or wontmy job is to highlight an issue
erotica 1 involved out of game harassment please point to where manny or any pl member involved with that scam was involved with out of game harassment if you think ingame scamming is a major issue and should automatically disqualify a player from running for csm then i highly suggest you petition ccp to remove any candidate whose group scams other players
lol please point where i said manfred was involved with any of the above learn to read replies the question was what is normal people in eve  those who scam or those who do not erotica 1 episode demonstrated that majority of people are against scamming ergo that is the normal behavior and in any situation where there is a popularity contest between a normal and a scammer  normal wins
u truly are a metagame masteru have singlehandedly ruined manfred manny  sideous career of fake videogame politicsthe world shall fear u 5evrmore
oh that would be too pretentious of me no i aspire to nothing of the sort reallyim just a simple bored eve bystander that sees a legitimate issue worth discussingbut dont let me stop you from trying to make me sound grand i might grow to like it
well you certainly got the fact that youre simple right at least
first  i am not the leader of pandemic legionsecondly  pandemic legion has all kinds of players engaging in all kinds of gameplay just because a guy solos in lowsec and is really good doesnt automatically mean the rest of us are as wellthird  i personally dont engage in scamming i would have to much guilt for it personally fourth  scamming is legal in eve as well as stealing despite how distasteful some people find it i am of the opinion that i like the diversity of gameplay in eve eve is a terrible cold and evil place and that makes it feel so much more excitingso i am sure this isnt going to satisfy you i am not a politician  i am just a guy that sincerely loves the game and the community and has alot of passion about it if i dont get your vote then welp sorry
thats a beautiful slippery slope the incident of erotica 1 revolved less around ingame scamming and more towards out of game harassment ccp falcon even said so in his posts admonishing that incidentso again please explain why you believe manfred sideous csm 10 candidate should have his candidacy revoked due to one of his comembers in pandemic legion partaking in an act of gameplay ccp endorseuntil such time this is a moot point and youre just flailing your arms while failing to understand what youre talking about
1 i was interested in your candidacy the first time and im happy to see you throwing your hat back in the ring
i respect a man that gets ahead of the issue and makes his stance known thank you for taking the time to answer it quicklyi have more then one vote and i will keep your candidacy in mind scamming is distasteful for me but not the only factor at the end of the day
3 votes from one of the curse friends
i never said manfred should have his candidacy revoked i said he is not fit there is a difference and dont put words in my mouthbut i will humour you as i understand what you are trying to sayin my opinion csm representative should stand for good things in eve improving gameplay reducing scamming ganking harassment etc those that do not by omission of leadership included in my opinion are not fit for csm dutysimple explanation really you may disagree of course but it is your opinion against mine we shall see how the votes pan out
not empty quoting
you have my vote
i dont see why it should its not as though he is twelve he has probably twice the maturity levels of any current csm member and he has the experience and ideas of somebody who should be heardhe also said he would decree that everyone will receive 100 exotic dancers if he was to winyay exotic dancers bobmon for csm
insulting the current csm and missing the point niceyou have to be of a certain age to run for the csm as dictated by ccp and youre required to submit a passport screenshot for proof there are a few reasons for this but afaik its mostly so that you can attend the summits in icelandedit but yay exotic dancers
1 good man
this is an adorable attempt at trolling and ad hominem but please let bobmon answer the question for himself it is a rather large issue for his campaign if he is ineligible automatically due to the csm white pages list of minimum criteriabobmon seems like a decent fellow but if hes ineligible then hes ineligible plain and simple no amount of pedantic posts by you can really change that
as soo as i can i will
your question wasare you too young for thishe is a legal adult in pretty much every country in the world i dont see why he cant if 21 is the limit its obviously outdated and should be changed to accommodate the future of the gaming community is it fair to say that your opinion is only valid if youre at least 21 at eighteen years of age mostif not all a part from weird little cesspools of dictatorships in africa and south america are legally allowed to vote in elections how does it make sense that we can trust an eighteen year old to select the future leader of a country but we cant trust them to vote on issues in eve sure this is something bobmon should be discussing but dont you think it affects the gaming community at large to say somebody is ineligible to vote on issues that concern the community solely because theyre underage is an outrage especially when the game is aimed towards that age demographic bobmon for csm
yes letUFFFDs change icelandic law to suit the needs of some spaceship nerd that would like to be a rep to the community for a few monthsUFFFD if the icelandic government says you have to be a certain age to do things drink sign ndaUFFFDs in their country then thatUFFFDs the age you have to be quite shore the main age demographic of eve is 1880 at a fan fest a year or 2 back they showed the average age of an eve player to be 2636 or somethingedit ccp gave us the info yay and i was right it is between 26 and 36
his question wasnt if he was too young for this it was if he could actually run based on ccps longstanding rule which our dear friend bob has yet to answer
as soo as i can i will
good to see youre not giving up even after 99 of your own alliance rejecting you as a legitimate candidate bobmong
people have the right to choose who ever they want thankfully there are others even in pl who gave me a 1 so we will see how this goes
i wouldnt hold your breath your contributions to eve are hardly extensive even if you do try and count your iliterate attempts at writing articles for a second rate news site serious question how damaging do you think your bad penmanship will be to your campaign
not very hedliner i do my best and as long as i get my message across im happy
snip please refrain from personal attacks isd ezwalits a rather straight forward question if youre 21 then youre good if youre 20 years old and under then youre not eligible per the csm white pages unless those change this year
i have removed a rule breaking post please people keep it on topic and above all civilthe rules4 personal attacks are prohibited commonly known as flaming personal attacks are posts that are designed to personally berate or insult another forum user posts of this nature are not beneficial to the community spirit that ccp promote and as such they will not be toleratedisd ezwal community communication liaisons ccls
who knew asking someone who has avoided a question about his age and the eligibility pertaining to it if they didnt know their birthday or if they were consulting with ccp to potentially change the rules was considered a personal attack to isd ezwal
not avoiding them hendrick i said that as soon as i know more i will post it
so its safe to assume that youre awaiting ccp to confirm or deny any appeal to change the age requirements from the csm white pages then again its a rather straight forward question you stalling to answer
just kidding about the brostatus thing gorski knows his pvp and understands how mechanics being introduced can affect that aspect of the game
what is your view on competitive pvp in eve at neo some kind of dojowhere do you see eve in a year regarding competitive gameplay
thoughts on ogb
as a pilot who has flown in a couple of alliance tournaments both neos and scls i have to say that i am a big fan of competitive eve i think that ccp should continue running these events i think that events like these is a good way to get people into eve because it looks exciting competitive eve is also very different from normal eve pvp and it does a good work of bringing bitter vets and people wanting to try something new back to eve pvp i know personally that i was kinda numb from dumpstering scrubs in lowsec but when i went into my first alliance tournament was when i got the shakes back that i liked so much from my first moments as a pvperlarge 2k vs 2k battles in 00 battles also do this well but i feel the smaller scale pvp with commentators is a bit faster and more exciting to watch in a year i really want ccp to still be doing the tournaments i think they should keep alliance tournament as the big tournament every year that people look forward to and the one with the biggest reward i think ccp should be looking into maybe doing some smaller tournaments where people can qualify for neoat or win some cheaper prizesbut i also think that players should take some more responsibility creating these events currently these events are kinda hard to arrange for players but the dojo while kinda unrefined is a good start towards making this easier for people to handle
capsuleersmy name is xander phoena and i would like to confirm my candidacy for the 10th council of stellar managementbefore we go any further if you want to know a little more about me and my work on csm9 you should begin by reading my candidacy announcement for csm9 my main goal was to stand for two key things UFFFD work on 00 and UFFFDcommunicationUFFFD in the broadest sense between csm ccp and the player baseletUFFFDs look at a report card for both of these goalscommunication UFFFD my weekly reports have kept the player base informed of what csm9 is up to on a regular basis with insight to what we are up to as a group where we agreed with ccp where we disagreed with one another and what particular issues i was personally focused on at any given timeiUFFFDm very pleased that i have been able to keep these going every single week despite issues being offshore and such like that said more could be done both personally and as a collective i said this last yearUFFFDthe csm as a body fails if it does not adequately communicate the wishes and thoughts of the player base to ccp ccps intentions and plans to the player base within nda obviously and its own work to bothUFFFDwe are closer to the above goal than we were a year ago but the work is not yet completenullsec UFFFD ccp is tackling 00 head on we have had the jump nerf and some tweaks to structure hp but major changes to sovereignty are just around the corner it is imperative that csm does what it can to keep ccp on the righteous path they are currently on over the past few months we have seen blocs at war ingame join hands to push ccp for change UFFFD 00 has never been so unified in ensuring sovereignty is improved for the overall health of the game i have played some small part in that and wish to continue to domuch good work has been done by ccp and csm9 over the past six or so months ccp is taking bold and brave steps in breathing new life into new eden and csm9 has been a vital part of that but based on the two goals i set myself for csm9 the work has begun and is going well but i feel the need to see it through to the end and to do that i believe i need another term as a council memberi mentioned last year how i had worked very hard during csm7 and csm8 to bring the csm closer to the player base and i can tell you that that doesnUFFFDt even begin to compare to the work involved in being a member of the csm it is also incredibly satisfying to feel you have made some small impact on the sandbox that is eve many of you talk about how the csm does nothing or has no power i highly recommend you read thisto see how some csm members worked incredibly hard on feedback received from the community on input automation via third party software and enacted real change in the game this is a tangible specific proof that your votes matter last year i was worried that my work offshore would make it difficult to be an effective member of csm i can confirm as i hope can others on csm9 that it hasnUFFFDt proved to be a hindrance indeed it proved to be a huge help during the summer summit where i was able to attend every session bar one remotely from home i worked hard to bring csm to the player base before i was elected and i have worked incredibly hard as a csm member over the past six or seven months vote for me and i will continue to do so most importantly even if you donUFFFDt vote for me vote for someonethank you for your timexander
i highly recommend people read ccp leeloos csm9 dev blog from yesterday here

ive known xander precsm 9 and have recently worked with him on crossingzebrascom and the new eve101com websiteswhile he can be a chore to communicate with at times due to timezone differences and depending on if hes on crappy oil rig internet he has always seen something through he promised he would see throughhis podcast is quite good and he posts weekly about the role csm have had in recent changes or announcements
at the time of the last election i did not know xander personally but he had my vote in him i saw a candidate who was not a celebrity fc or held a highlevel bloc leadership position but a representative of the many nullsec line members not only that i also saw someone who did his utmost best to deliver independent quality content for the community despite his demanding work schedule heres a candidate who kept his head level and his thoughts focused never partisan always passionate about the game and its players and with his moral compass pointing in the right directionsince i have become a member of crossing zebras staff i only found every single quality i had assumed about him to be true if you vote  as you hopefully will  then xander definitely deserves to be on your ballot not because some ingame group endorses him but because the csm needs people like himalso if he gets elected he promised he will wear one of those quaint checkered skirts the male natives of his country dress in on formal occasions
i am glad xander is running again he has been and still is a strong proponent of the csm process and an easy guy to work withmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
xander is a great csm and ill be voting for him he goes out of his way to communicate with people and try to keep people informed all you have to do is look at some of his publications and videos to know this guy has passion for the game and community
sion and i havent always seen eye to eye during csm9 some of that is public knowledge some less so for what its worth he is easily in the top two or three hardest workers on csm9 and while we may disagree from time to time i have absolute belief that he cares about the future of the game he doesnt need my endorsement but someone who works so hard and has such passion for the game has it anyway
i like you i am going to vote for you do you like me
hello skandellol yes i like you too thank you for your support  rl
im dradis aulmais im a new player i was born april this year about the candidatein real life i am 27 i was in the military for 3 years and now work in the evnvormental clean up industry i have played wow since bc and grew to find it incredibly boring a quick google search lead me to a new place a new eden i joined in april of this year and quickly subbed my account the very complexity and depth to thia game is what pulls me in issuesnew player as a new player the learning curve is steep there was and still is many aspects of this game i have trouble with i have tried industry mining fw exploration and now i am in a corp in npc null where i can get my hands dirty at pvpthe parts i had trouble with and would like to see addressed are skills  starting out skills are confusing i had no idea what skills did besides letting me use certain ships and items more information via the tutorial would have made this betterfittings  this is something i still have problems with theres so many stats you have to track i think we could be clearer on what these stats do sov null i have very little experience in this area so i will reserve comment on this issueoacessablity issuesadjusting sound and text to accommodate disabled players is an issue i would like to work towards fixingi am always open to questions so ask away im young but driven let me work for you

so if your main point is the npe what would you do should that happen to get fixed
i would like more transparency from ccp related to ddoss attacks when the last series of ddos attacks where hitting games across the world game companys where slow to acknowledge it this led to frustration among the base i would like a quicker response and more preventive measures in place can you reduce a ddos  i would also see improvements on the tranquility sever mainly in load balancing and latency jita is a main trade hub its always packed i believe ccp can do a better job keeping these systems active and available not tidi and closed
1 ccp rise gave a presentation at fanfest 2014 on the general direction his team wanted to take the new player experience have you watched it its worth it because theyre not thinking of iterating on what we have now theyre looking at starting over with a completely different approach2 its extremely difficult to counter a ddos for roughly the same reason that its hard to counter a flood what would you have them do3 ccp is working on the back end of eve to tackle various performance issues team gridlock also gave a presentation at fanfest 2014 giving an overview of what theyre trying to do and what theyre up against definitely worth watching the tldr is that load balancing in a game like eve is a difficult problem in the best case but more so when youre making live changes to your morethan10yearold game engine written in a language that doesnt really understand what threads are
funny how a couple salty hotdropping alliances are trying to astroturf threads like this into relevance are you guys so stymied by your inability to bridge everywhere that the only other thing you can think to do is launch forum ops the changes were needed and most of the coalitions like them sometimes eve requires that you adjust your play style
well hello theremy name is lanctharus onzo and i am one of the cohost and writers of the cap stable podcastin early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10here is our announcement
started a blog and updated the orginal post to try reflect a more considered approach
i endorse steve for csm
oh look another carebear wanting to turn hisec into a riskfree disneylandwhen eve becomes a milquetoast wow of hisec fappery we will be able to look back through successive csm members like ripard teg mike asariah and this carebear as the clapping seals who didnt fight ccp on behalf of preserving the sandbox and our htfu traditionsbut then it will be too latetldrdo not elect carebears like this to the csmf
not exactly but if you had read what has been written you would have known that for example the post directly above yours
vote tora bushido time for a new generation of leaders to step up
either you log off cloaked ewarp and your ship sits in space uncloaked and probable fori cant remember 30 seconds or a minute when i was in wspace i always safe loggedor you safe log off which involves deactivating all modules including your cloak and sitting there while the timer runs downin the former case active hunters with probes out can likely pin you and blow up your ship once youve left the game in the latter case youre basically spamming dscan hoping that you dont see 4 or more combat probes before your timer ticks downits 30 seconds so any good prober in system with probes out is going to catch youand cloaking up and bouncing safes if you do see probes in which case you have to start over again at 30 secondsor you can just cloak up and wait
my support of any csm candidate is tied to some specific things1 remove the wardecdodge exploit after an aggressor has paid good isk for a war a defender can just drop corp and reform under a new corp for negligible comparative costs effectively ending the war and making wars consensual only this exploit must be closed period one remedy is to have wars follow individuals if they leave corp another is to increase corp creation costs to 50m isk 2 incentivize war defenseput all aggressor wardec fees into a bucket claimable by the defender or his allies based on aggressor assets killed3 incentivize corp membership disincentivize npc corp membershipincrease npc corp taxes to 60 for players older than 30 days if you want to be safe from wardecs and hide out in an npc corp forever fine but its going to cost you for that privilege further i do not think wardec fees should be increased as a priority until the above issues are addressed firsti do not think ganking mechanics changes are a priority ganking has already been nerfed as wars have and there are guides on how to avoid it for my support for what its worth i would also invite sabriz to comment on the abovef
hello mikejust so that you know i havent forgotten about you we just have been busy fighting in catch so to be completely fair and not make you feel excludedgood to hear that you have decided to run againas you are aware we at the cap stable podcast interviewed you during your run for csm9 and we wish to do the same this year for csm10here is our announcement
im not so much interested in answerswhich is why my questions are generally too big to answeras i am in revealing thought processes csm strikes me as involving a strong analytical component so i like to watch the candidates thinki cant really argue against nda but its a shame that i wont get to see that paragraph given that its what i was angling for still im sure its the best answer you can give and its tantalizing i agree 100 with your key point
a vote for mike is a vote for continuing down the road to nerfdom and slow watertorture death of the non consensual conflict traditions eve was founded on mike offers the usual platitudes of every liberal social engineer to have haunted real world political circles that he is all about the middle ground whatever makes sense or that he doesnt go to extremeswhile constitutions lay shredded and freedom lays destroyedany csm or candidate that refuses to swear an oath to the eve constitution that they will never support any change that reduces player conflict and will only embrace changes that increase player conflict should be summarily removed from consideration mike does not subscribe to this pledgein past years eve was defined by its htfu nature the nonconsensual hard fit the live or die by your wits ethos that made it special and different from wow mike would take us down that wow road while pretending not to while espousing middle ground platitudes yes mike is a nice guywhile he is slitting eves throat and refusing to acknowledge he is doing itthere is no middle ground between food and poison just poisoned food once you deem htfu as the food keeping eve alive and nerfs the poison to one day kill it there is no rationalizing a mixture of the two one is good one is bad a middleground mix is where disingenuous evil liesa vote for mike is a vote for disneyland in hisec and making eve into wow period he would just go about it slower than more upfront carebear radicals and then years from now perhaps say i never intended for that to happen when all that is left is dust however if you do want to turn eve into a pansy dreamland disneyland of wow in space mike is indeed your manf
ive just posted a soundcloud recording of a very informal discussion about wardec mechanics i did with beboparhubarbpie and a couple of other peopleits available here
wonderful accent on you and an interesting topic im glad you are not shying away from these vectors in the game that seem to have garnered such distaste recently at least from what i see looking aroundi would like to add that these darker elements of eve are interesting to me as well
it was you and bebop who kept me in the game sabriz met you in the mining chat bebop in euni chatwithout you two id not have joined the new order i was on the verge of quitting this game whilst on the path to leveling up to a dominixyou have my vote
well for starters thats nto what you said this iswhich is wrong some people do play just to play the pve content did you even listen to fanfest its not about whether or not they think they affect other things its about how they want to play and you wont accept there are other people who play in a different way to you and who can and should be able to continue doing so because its a sandbox not an everybody plays my wayand sure eve is about impacting each other what its not about is adding more game mechanics so you and your mates have more cannon fodder in the form of players who dont want to fight adding better paying missions which require people to fly into gank zones isnt about adding unique ways for players to interact its about adding a place you can gank ships that would normally be ungankable with very little at riskat the end of the day youre a scammer a ganker and you seem to have very little interest in even acknowledging other players playstyles let alone supporting them so youd really not be doing the game a favour if you secured a position in the csm
and suddenly it all becomes clear  lucas is frying doom who viewers may recall attempted to  up previous csm threads only to see those candidates win never stop poasting frying kell
i actually want lucas and others like him that reject large swathes of my platform but are capable of remaining civil to bring some hard questions to my ask me anything interview details to be confirmed but probably december 20 2330 eve time on the minerbumping teamspeak hell be welcome in person if he wishes and is ok with being recorded or he can submit questions in absentia
who are you again oh nobody shush then kiddo grown ups are talkingthere would be no point so you can hop on your teamspeak server and record yourself saying whatever you can to get votes the only thing that matters is looking at your past and seeing what is is you are and are not in favour of whether or not your can bs your way through an interview now is irrelevant im not against scamming and ganking or generating more opportunities for pvp but they certainly shouldnt take priority over historically bad mechanics long overdue for a revamp and players who dont scam gank and pvp shouldnt be treated as if they do not exist
you have my interestyou just lost meone question what is your position on the current exploit that allows a defender to completely duck a war by leaving or disbanding corp and immediately creating a new one or fleeing to npc corp for a weekwould you champion the closing of said exploitf
responding and adding more to the response i made this morningim for a meaningful unilateral surrender that means serious concessions not some oh heres a refund of your dec fee now go away i would not support unilateral surrender options that dont feel like a defeat to the defender and a victory to the aggressor the goal here is that a corporation would be incentivised to defend itself unless overwhelmingly outmatched but that they have a surrender option if they would otherwise simply not undock for a weeki would not endorse such a surrender being available in the first 48 hours of a war going live nor for entities with anchored structuresim for closing that exploit yes i would push for ccp to return to considering disbanding and reforming corp an exploit again likewise various other permutations like having six corps five with just a ceo and the main corp where everyone drops from the main corp into one of the alt corps as for people dropping corp to hide in an npc corp for a week  anything that bans doing that will have other consequences that are serious such as two permanent wardecs preventing anyone leaving a corporation but i also want to provide incentives to stick to your corp one rough idea is a mechanic where if your corporation has earned five million lp from missions over its existence the corporation gets a bonus of 05 or 1 to lp gain from missions that only applies to members that have been in the corp 14 days or longer a second tier of this bonus might exist at 25 million lp these provide an incentive to stay loyal over time id add the same for mining but as i have less experience with mining im not sure what appropriate numbers would be perhaps a first tier of 05 cycle time for mining lasers at 50 million cubic metres of oreice mined and a second tier at 250 millionif you drop to an npc corp you therefore dont just miss out on a few percent of mission completion rewards and bounties you lose out on possible bonuses to mining yield and mission lp rewards and you dont get them back just for setting up your own new solo corp or even immediately upon joining an established corpimportantly however the thresholds at which any of these bonuses kick in should not be set so high that they set a major barrier to creating a new corporationfinally on npc corps and long term players i think dropping to an npc corp should be a viable option for someone that derps badly and loses everything and it should be a viable place to rebuild until you both own and can afford to lose a hac t1 battleship or a similar level of ship but they should offer nothing to players with those shipsmy concrete suggestion is to change the tax system to apply only to bounty ticks and agent mission rewards exceeding 500k isk presently the threshold is 100k but for the tax to be much much higher and to apply to incursion payouts mission lp rewards and if a mechanism can be found to do this to mining and potentially market interactions for a rookie in their failfit level 3 mission battlecruiser they will seldom notice taxes but for someone blitzing l4s being in a player corporation would be strongly incentivised
i havent checked nor asked nor did i announce it big   maybe they dont like me haha i serieusly have no clue i dont belong to a big null voting block except my own   we agreed indeed to not comment on eachother i on my side havent posted in their campaigns either and i dont feel the need they are all very competent in their own way and add too a mix of poeple that ran a succesfull csm in my eyes but i dont feel like posting i like xander to get him to write it here nor aproach him as example or any other in there i rather let the players that know me trust me my actions that made them vote for me last year decide if i get in again on which i am confident of my own performance nor am i involved in cross ballot voting which i dislike or any of the forming groups that work with tactical voting lists i endorsed bobmon as i met him and know he s a stand up kid and maybe hero and i have a chat about common intrests in null but i past the backroom dealing 2 csm s ago and didnt like it independant but to my knowledge no major  between any of the current csm members
sugar kyle has already reached out to us regarding an interview but for the sake of fairnessgood to hear that you have decided to run againas you are aware we at the cap stable podcast interviewed you during your run for csm9 and we wish to do the same this year for csm10here is our announcement
i also endorse sugar kyle for csm
its happened at least three times in recent history that i can remember manny erotica 1 lucia denniard just because theyre less public incidents than the infamous kcom one doesnt mean they arent happening so youre influential enough within gsfcfc to tell him to reverse his decision as an it guy let me tell you just how hard that is in my own experiences sysops are the least receptive people to be told that theyre wrong but not influential enough to either get him to stop doing it altogether or to remove him from the alliance because as i said above his actions are less public now but they still happen and thats a problemyouve clearly said that you dont condone what he does so does that mean others in gsf who are above you do iirc theres only 2 more people above you and thats mittani and sionlike hes already been banned from sa the gsf homeland for admitting to collecting personal info on people isnt that enough of a smoking gun
i cannot ban people and i have to ask to get people unbanned and every single time i do that it is a lengthy period costume dramathere is not much more i can do except to repeat that i dont doxx people i have nothing to do with it i dont even remember anyone publishing any details about lucia or erotica thankfully and i disagree with other people doing so its not part of the game of eve i play and it has nothing to do with the csm if that is getting boring then i apologise but thats the truth
youre an absolute imbecile i want you to know thathe has absolutely nothing to do with that for starters nevermind that if i judged your alliance by how you behave then id be doing them a disservice indeed since i doubt theyre all sjw wannabe moral crusader slime like you1 to manny hes been on the ball with some things lately and he basically called the jump range changes way before they actually happened edit oh yes and a question if you had one and only one issue you could really stand behind what would it be and why
manny understands that this game isnt a crappy playground for idiots and accepts that scamming  the fine art of separating the idiot from his pixels  is a tradition in eve and an honourable profession choicehe has solidly earned his place on my ballot its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
well hello theremy name is lanctharus onzo and i am one of the cohost and writers of the cap stable podcastin early 2014 our podcast interviewed a great majority of the candidates for csm9 and we will be doing the same for csm10here is our announcement
0utbreak with a zero manny ps u got my vote 3
is that why youre part of a corp that has scammers
not sure why the scamming hate for pl here pl are mostly good guys top notch pilots and the vast majority of them are not involved in this stuff a few bad apples sure but nothing like the degree of scamming in goons or the rest of the cfc being in the leadership of pl is certainly not disqualifying for being an asset to the game and being on csm i would definitely consider voting for manny but id like to here more about his thoughts on highsec ganking awoxxing wardeccs etc any ideas
if youre not smart enough to not get scammed youre not smart enough to play this game
plus one manny good luck mate
vote for the man because of his own stance his own actions and his own deeds not because of what someone else in his alliance does or does not do if you only elect people from alliances whose members never scam then you will end up with all the nullsec representatives from provi and etny and that might not be wholly representativeeve is a dark exciting dangerous place and scamming piracy and allround depravity have always been huge draws for the game like manny i dont scam due to having too much of a guilty conscience to be comfortable with it but it is part of the game we all chose to play you cant move in next door to a nightclub then complain of noise in the night
please dont even joke about that
you know youve got my vote 3
hi xandergreat to hear youre running again 1
xander has already reached out to me in regards to an interview but for the sake of fairness dgood to hear that you have decided to run againas you are aware we at the cap stable podcast interviewed you during your run for csm9 and we wish to do the same this year for csm10here is our announcement
do not elect this man he is a traitor to my heart
ignore hvac this post leaves him with egg on his face xander is a good man
xander and endie are like the only good scots in the worlda pity they still lick the boot of the queen
xander is ok but he still hasnt been able to explain what irn bru tastes likeso take that as you will
xander is a rare thing in a csm hes proactive and communicative i actually feel like the csm does something other than get a trip to iceland after interacting with him
hi xanderyou and crossing zebras are the reason i actually know anything about the csm for me your communication and thought processes have been wonderful so you do indeed have my vote in yc117having said that id like to ask you some questions im asking the candidates im seriously considering if i couldspace has become littered with abandoned pos structures what is your position on getting rid of them id like to see perhaps a orbital degrading mechanic once the fuel is gone this then would open up the moons for pilots that will actually use them the current mechanic of course involves wardecing a possibly abandoned corp and then sitting there for an extended period of time blapping the structures i think something better is quite possibleeve seems to be popularly seen as more than a game perhaps moving into the hobby realm im aware that some discussions have been held with regard to finding a way to bring a more casual player or a more casual playstyle option into eve would you advocate this if so how might this be done without fundamentally changing the nature of the game would itit seems a given that csm x and ccp will look at dealing with the sovnull question this term beyond that from a gameplay perspective what would you advocate as the next priorityeve players seem to be quite passionate about the game yet it is said that the voting rate for csm elections is lower than that of even the united states midterms does this diminish the validity of the csm what would you like to do to combat the voter apathy that we see and effectively educate the voters on the reality of what the csm can effectively dofinally and most importantly do you like cats thanks so much alan mathison explorer  industrialist star tide industries
xander has been an excellent csm throughout his whole tenure and his crossing zebras blog has been great at communicating with the entire community  1
i didnt vote for you last time because i was indifferent to yet another nullsec bloc candidate but youve distinguished yourself and youve provided lots of meaty updates and analysis at cz so im happy to eat crow about last years judgment of you youll be on the ballots
xander is awesome and in his time in pl has absolutely set the standard for a csm to be communicative and approachable hes just a great dude who has already proven he can do a great job at this and has the passion and energy to keep on succeeding youve got my vote boss
xander has demonstrated that he is a great communicator which is an ideal trait for a member of the csm as they are charged with communicating between the devs and the playershe is exactly the guy i want the devs to come to when they are trying to decipher the rationale behind our the players opinions of game design changes he has my vote
i think some kind of degrade mechanic would be entirely reasonable as you know structures are going to be addressed soon  mainly in the case of sov but certainly not exclusively ill definitely make sure this question is asked at winter summit hm this is a tough one see on the one hand i would like to see there be more ways to play eve quickly i hate that in eve you normally need to sit down and dedicate a good chunk of time to any given play session fw is maybe one of the few exceptions to this so i guess i am more an advocate of quicker gameplay options as opposed to more casual ones whether that is actually an achievable goal im not so sure i definitely like the fact that eve isnt a simple game and it caters to a fairly specific audience im not necessarily sure attempting to attract a more casual audience in an attempt to increase subs is the way to go forward another tricky one i think lowsec as a whole not just fw could probably do with a good looking at i think its purpose and niche within the wider eve universe has perhaps lost some focus of late and it could do with being worked on of course those who fly in lowsec may avidly disagree with me therei dont think it diminishes the validity of the csm i also dont think there is a direct correlation between what the csm can achieve and voter turnout that said its reasonable to assume that ccp would be more likely to trust a csm advocating a particular position on behalf of the player base when 90 of that player base voted them in than if 10 voted them in as such we all need to work hard to increase voter turnoutas to what can be done ccp do seem to be doing more and i have very high hopes for that they have planned for the csm x election as csm members it is imperative that we each actively go out and engage with the player base i myself have regularly blogged and taken part on tweetfleet i know some others have blogged some have been incredibly active writing for news sites some have been active on eveo or on their own alliance forums etc i will be watching the turnout figures for csm x very closely indeedi love cats and own one but i hate to tell you i prefer dogs myself and my wife have two labradors and they are way more fun that our cat who i feel barely tolerates our existence thanks for the questions
xander has been a sincere and effective member of csm9 and its also my personal opinion that hes a good character who would be too proud to betray his duty csm x will god willing have many eve luminaries members of the great and good of eve who are obviously attracted to a term due to the increase in the csms credibility and reputation earned by the previous and current teams but amongst these titans we should remember that just as the unconnected unprivileged little guy in hisec needs a man like mike azariah so the average mediocre grunt in 00 needs someone to represent his viewpoint and needs as welland i deeply believe that xander has the long exerience both in game and on the csm to accurately represent that constituency
cause the players gonna play play play play playand the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hatego for it u know who u are
iUFFFDve known and worked with sion for years and he is a calm methodical and thoughtful person who knows nullsec eve in particular extraordinarily well he has made an excellent csm so far and i have no doubt he will be even more effective next time you just need to read the minutes to see the impact he has made

a new name is always welcome and this is the first time i think anyone has run with multiboxing in their platformshould be fun to watch the fireworks at the very least
thank you i agree if nothing else this will shine a light on a part of eve that many either hate with little to no information or ignore completelycheck out my podcast my blog

a character can create a new application to join a corporation from anywhere previously could applications could only be submitted whilst docked in a stationyou are correct i wrote this up and have been working on it for quite a while now thank you for the correctioni have multiboxed eve since almost the beginning with more than one account then three now i have started utilizing third party software and am up to 7 as a multiboxer this simply means more than one account over half of eves players are multiboxers but dont necessarily consider themselves as such let me put this out there right now i support the upcoming broadcasting changes but most of the multiboxing community feels misrepresented and their playstyle has come into question and attack with little to no response from ccp i feel all multiboxers should be represented correctly and communication between some of this games most devout supporters and its developers needs to happen this change actually affects me very little but it affects some dedicated players a great deal third party software can be considered any mouse with a program or hotkey built in those mice with multiple buttons that you can map to evethats third party software either way third party software has a huge impact on this game and there is not a single player that does not use it to affect their game play the issue is how the third party software is being used and how it affects players some believe stuff like siggy and unsupported cache scrapping like eve central agaisnt the eula is ok and some dont just like some dont agree with third party multiboxing software there simply needs to be representation i hope to be that not everyone will agree i just hope enough do to let me help the community communicate bettercheck out my podcast my blog

god lord the walls of text one had to plow throughjust wanted to point out the misconception that while gankers could gank again 15min later a hauler would have to spend hours upon hours getting the minerals for a new hull thats bullshit after a hauler is ganked that pilot could technically sit in a new freigher the moment he docked if he was prepared otherwise downtime would be the travelling time to closest station with one availablegankers can only be up and ready for another run in 15 min if they have a cache of ships and a target available or are we gonna take into account the time they would have to spend mining in order to build their precious hulls

thanks for the video links i havent seen them i was only able to see the economic presentation the code used for eves old and i think i know of a program that may help but im not familiar with the specifics of it it was used to update the legacy code in the faa system i have to look into the details and link it here later it may be something worth looking in tofound it 
over the past few months there has been discussion in the features and ideas forums of the merit of adding a new class of ships to the game whose purpose will the rapid construction and destruction of deployable structures so far the reception has been very positive here is the link and i will summarize the discussion so far here if you dont feel like reading through ten pages
you have to be trollingfor starters if you think battleships are weak then mail me in game and you can fight minethe rest of it must be a troll no sir i dont like your version of eve at allyour rantings sound like the rattles of a teen with too much time on her handsyou know what eve needsmoa ponies
know how the gurista logo is on some ships i can get on board with some ponies on a ship little easter egg for those that zoom in far enough
third party and industry steve is your man i wouldnt know much about it glad he looks into that if crest api is yoru future follow him last csm had several departures and those that sticked with it did their share a nice spread of interest steve specificslly mentions pve where others call themselves null or pvpgoodluck steve
ccp keeps repeating that new player retention is much better for players that join player corporations yet wardecks make high sec carebear corporations foolish affair we really need change that even if it means having corplite and tears of some high sec pvpers
thats a part of eveeve is not nor is it supposed to be easy most things in eve you have to fight for and nobody is gonna hold your hand while you figure out how to do it the first corp i ever joined got deced into oblivion cause most of the members didnt want to fight such is life but saying that high sec wars are why players dont stay in eve is kinda silly
no ccp is saying that player retention is much higher when you get players to socialize nothing silly with that makes perfect sense
thank you for taking time to read my threadwell i am serious just because i do not say all the things you agree with does not make me any less serious that 50 chance can be achieved in a myriad of waysone of the first among them would be teaching new players having some kind of tutorial about dscan and how to use it if i am paying attention to dscan then it is harder for the catalysts or atrons to get close enough that is worth a few percentage points right there the problem is there is nothing letting new players know about dscan there is no official guide to sensible fitting or even really the basicslike i said give me the tools to do what i can and then if i choose not to do it then it is my faultprobably not at least not if i do it properlyvote for me and them if you want there is room for more than one high sec member on the csm one of my main points is also to try and get people to vote at all so even if you dont want to vote for me and want to make sure that i have no success please vote for someone that way we know you careoh at the start i thanked you for reading my threadi should just have thanked you for replying to my thread i dont know what i am saying that would be a nerf to gankers for example in fact some gankers might claim that with the faction police concord the barge buffs that they have a significant disadvantage and in the interests of coming up to 50 they need some love toofunny that the gankers dont say that
the net effect of this change would be that less people would gank with implants whatever while you have more people getting complacent and hauling even more loot it wont reduce ganking for profit and podkills are essentially meaningless without implants being destroyed its easy to speak for the silent majority they rarely object to what you put into their mouths  abrazzar
having met tora at evesterdam flown in marmite collective on an alt and being heavily involved with hisec pvp for a reasonable amount of time before my current stint in oe i will unequivocally denounce any sort of run by tora bushido for the csmwhile we may agree on a number of issues facing the game i cannot endorse tora as a worthwhile representative of any player in eve especially those he claims to represent the most he has absolutely no ability to effectively communicate or conduct himself with any sort of respect for his audience or peers in other words he is selfinvolved selfish and short sighted i base this conclusion based upon his behavior during evesterdam presentations talking joking with neighbors generally not giving the presenter their due respect and my experience with him as an alliance leader not encouraging content creativity a supportive environment to try new things in hisec tldr while his ideas may be appealing i would not want this person representing hisec pvpers to ccp or representing ccps ideas to the playersill also say most of his outline in the op is illformed garbage but im intentionally avoiding that to focus on the real issue im trying to point out
less loot anywhere in fighting suckspeople afk cloak in systems to prevent isboxer people from 1 button warping 25 mining ships into a area and again 1 button pressing all the locking and miningfurthermore the broken mechanic of being able to see everyone in local in null sec reinforces thisfunny though your from null sec and not one mention of it reallywhat you have to offer is little to nothing
you might have different views on things in eve and real life and thats ok the biggest difference between you and me is i tell people that right away straight in the face and not on the forums when it suites me but youre right making jokes at a great thing as evesterdam is terribad and laughing with the entire group about good presentations is also very bad having fun with you at the bar when you accept our beers ahh well i think you get the point by now very disrespectful to use an event as evesterdam for your own personal issues youre probably the last to lecture me about respect
send tora a fedo for every vote you plan to give himsniped
you found my weak spot a few thousand fedos might stop me from running for csm
i was laughing imagining the contracts pyou will soon need a whole system for that fedo sanctuary d
if people vote for me they will know their fedos are safe already have a few thousand running around in my hq no joke 
im offended at the presumption that i somehow used evesterdam as some vehicle for a personal vendetta i observed you acting like an ass i felt it pertained to your csm run of which i had no knowledge of at evesterdam and i voiced my opinionif i were you id be telling people how good your interpersonal skills are but seeing that you lack any ability to respond to criticism in any sane manner that would just be a waste of everyones time
are you sure beer was all you had in amsterdam  funny how your opinion is so different then all the other people i spoke too personal opinions are ok but dont go crazy on the fairy tales you are offendedlol
to be honest while ive only had contact with you through the game id be surprised if micheles comments are far off you are pretty self obsessed and not really a people person it would be half interesting to see you get onto the csm just to see how long it takes for them to ask you not to show up to meetings that said its probably better for people to stick their votes somewhere they might make a worthy difference
are we talking about me or yourself lucas  if there is someone who enjoys listening to his own long forum posts its you mate do you think i could run marmites for years if i wasnt a people person players who have been there from the start do you think i would have good relations with so many alliances all over eve  just because you dont know about these things doesnt mean they arent there you life in your own perfect world where everyone else is weird which is ok but remember its just your fantasy world dont start making up things because it makes you feel better thats not very nice is it me waiting for longggg i am lucas i am so great posts
an absolute bear would also say the same thing in reverse if theres one thing ive learned about mike in the 2 years hes been a regular on podside is that he doesnt deal in absolutesif you are a full blooded code adherent interested in murder for murders sake or a super bear who wants 100 safety mike is not the candidate for youhe is the candidate for those who can respect a balanced and wellrounded perspective
some of your ideas would of been nicethe last people i vote for are the ones with no ideaswe have enough political figures like that
mike balls of steel azariah you have my vote oh gentleman and scholar
what subject would you prefer eve is a huge place with lots of facetsbut maybe you misunderstand the purpose of the csmwe dont make the roadmap we dont design the game or demand new features instead we help ccp with ideas that they have and bring modifications or ideas from you the electorate we may filter those ideas face it some ideas on the forums are bad but it is not upon us to write all the great next new things as a council of playersbest way to see where i stand is to read the minutes of the csm i have served for almost two years so a lot of what i have said and thought is a matter of record or if you have a particular cause    ask i will answer as i did feyd above obviously he was not happy with my answer and i am ok with that i say what i think not what i think you wantif reading the minutes is tldr then check out any number of podcasts i do get about and hit a fair number of them or wait for that interviews lanctharus and others will be doingthe bowhead was not my idea but i liked it and pushed for it damn glad to see it coming into the gameyou are electing a council to speak for you for the game as a wholemmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
lots of bad stuff will come of this thats why youll get my vote and my sig line at least for while
10
this was like wading through a pile of crap to find the bone then finding out there was no bonehow many paragraphs did he just post and literally tell no one about any ideas he had to improve anythingit was like watching a real political ad he really didnt tell you anything you really wanted to knowsure cant decide yes to someone with no positiondo not forward me to a different link where the information is he should of explained here
hard workingcritical and direct when needed a aswsome voice in helpchannels all the stuff already mentioned in replies fit her well a obvious x candidate that deserves a vote
1 vote no questions asked csm of our hearts
arguably it does as the csm can push for either policy or game mechanic changes to prevent the sort of out of game harassment being referred to we saw it with a firm usage of the ccp policies towards out of game harassment when the bonus room happened as well as with the eve monument incident these were out of game acts that ccp deemed detrimental to the community and took action against ccp were even scolded on video game press sites much like the fanfest suicidegate as being an example of a community that has problems differentiating between real life and video game land is it farfetched to think that collecting using or even spreading a players out of game personal info is just as detrimental if one player is actively and even openly admitting to collecting personal data outside of the game and using that information maliciously as is claimed then its a problem that ccp and the csm need to investigate and find a resolution to if they want to keep the meta game healthy and available to players the worst case scenario i can conceive is that if this sort of behavior goes unchecked an event will happen that will greatly damage the game the company that makes it and the players which ultimately see the meta game removed entirelyin the cited cases and yes there are others a player is collecting real life info on others and has been seen spreading that personal info to other players even if its a select few for example there are logs from themittanicoms editor jabber channel in which the mittani himself stated that he had digi look into and erotica 1s personal stuff and felt the need to share that information with tmc editors who werent involved in the counter intel and spying game we were writerseditors discussing erotica 1s application to join the staff we unanimously decided not to accept the application there is little purpose behind being told the personal life details of another player even if they were banned you admonish the act of disclosing mannys personal details on kcom i can only imagine that as dirk stated the case of digi supposedly contacting luccia out of game on a personal form of communication which she claims to never have disclosed would be equally deplorable to you again theres no rhyme or reason for doing any of these things out of game they dont even really have any context to ingame events or actions these among others are examples of the meta game going too far and potentially damaging to the eve community and its sandbox gameplay for the sake of ones own internet space pixelsthere was one person elsewhere who poised that if we are to condemn the act of doxxing and using out of game personal information to either out the spy harass blackmail or even intimidate them as being wrong then we must equally condemn the act of spying as the head of the goon spying group i would imagine you have some thoughts on this stance to this person the two cant be separated as the only way to prevent spies is to eventually hit out of game personal information even if its not intended you stated you agree that you dislike doxxing so then what would you propose to ccp as a csm delegate do to allow the act of ingame sandbox behavior such as spying and counterintel not spill over into out of game actions like the examples listed aboveedit  please note that this isnt a grr goons or grr digi post in any intended manner though i personally find digi to be woefully incompetent in his space job given the antics hes been up to its a this is a problem how do you intend to fix it if youre on the csm post
there is no need at all to feel a need to explain why you ask if ccp did feel the need to ask the csms opinion on this matter i would restate what ive said in my previous answers in the last few pages if they pushed me for a definitive solution id have to hold my hands up and admit that i dont have one but i think my distaste for anyone that acted like that and my sanguine reaction if ccp chose to ban someone for publicly intruding on someones personal life out of game should be pretty obvious its not something i would feel any desire to defend
manny has consistently impressed me with his knowledge of game mechanics and his ability to theorycraft the implications of potential game changes he has a deep knowledge a wealth of experience and the work ethic that the csm needs vote for manny ccp needs to hear what he has to say
my own eve career has drifted in and out of mannys path many time over the years not only is manny one of the most knowledgeable guys in eve hes also possibly the nicest guy ive met in gamewhile being nice doesnt make you a great csm  being knowledgeableactive helpful and most importantly a great communicator does make you a great csm
voting based on this alonegame desperately needs balance changes and this hits most of the problems on the headishtars lmao
but why bother either hell qualify in which this line of questioning is moot or he wont in which case any questions at all are moot
gorski came late but woudl have been a nice add on from the start hard core knowledge of small pvp direct in aproach he deserves a shot at a full term
vote for this guy literally the only candidate who actually plays the gamehe might even get heavy missiles bufahahahahhahahahahhahahajhaahsfdiouhq3w08yh45
xander deserves his next council obviously i knew him through his previous csm interrviews and he was a very nice guy also within the csm he s a guy with a moral compass and a passion for eve they say what you see if what you get xandr works hard nice guy worth your vote
so basically everyone wants to log on and create content be part of a fight get rich andor acquire something or otherwise partake of some chaos and hilarity however in the current state of eve this can be an actual challenge UFFFD so much of the population is in high sec which should come as no surprise as so much of the cheese is so safely available there for new and old player alike to grow fat and bored on the main principle i am running on is buffing npc null low sec and sov null to the extent that people can start in any security band from day one while also prospering learning and getting involved with the universe lets make eve like the trailers UFFFD for real distribute resources as content seeds and watch the players do the rest give people a challenge not a chore my goto success story is that of barleguet and brave newbies i am in no way affiliated with brave but i have seen their work first hand basically you had an empty lowsec system which was otherwise unremarkable besides for a few level 5 agents once they were done moving in barleguet was transformed into a 247 content stop where a man could buy a quafe a rifter and 5000 rounds of emp s and use them all on the way home just by concentrating some population all sorts of content sprung up new markets defense fleets and gangs coming from far and wide surely some of the most fierce players in brave now surely got their first lessons and adrenaline rushes from belt ratting around planet seven content fed a cycle of content creation an unimposing nonfw system became a huge hub of activity which brings me to the actual crux of it all UFFFD there needs to be more resources in low and null that are both profitable and accessible to new and old players resources which will both be in demand and create content the security tags and mordus angel spawns are great examples i think everyone sort of tacitly realizes that high sec l4s and incursions are a sacred cow that will not be tipped over any time soon ergo the solution if you want to promote more real interaction is to actually properly balance other resources and income potential if you could put another barleguet on the map you would create a great place for new players to actually learn the game and content for everyone the charm of barleguet wasnt smashing the day old player in the venture trying to get rich off that sweet sweet jaspet it was the chaos that immediately descended into asteroid belt for better or worse you just need an impetus to get people undocked the rest created itself i want a reason for a new group of players to rush out into lowsec struggle to survive lose countless ships but have a chance to become far wealthier than their high sec cousins and have many more exciting tales to share basically i am against anything new in high sec UFFFD high sec is fine add all new content to other security bands and plant the seeds of content today getting people to lose ships day one will create players who appreciate the beauty of the game alternatively they can just grow fat and bored in high sec and not create content for others and themselves the new player experience should be unique and personal not reminiscent of some tired quest hub npc telling them to slay 30 yeti and recover 30 yeti toenailsi mean 30 serpentis and tags give the new player a rifter and let the universe and his new friends be the teacher if you are a high sec player then you should still vote for me why half the reason high sec is such a warzone right now is because you have tons of bored players with nothing to shoot UFFFD all the big easy killmails are in high sec i used to run a ganking corporation under a proper rebalancing of resources there would a reason for some gankers to actually grow up and leave high sec as there would actually be content to chase incursions however should not even be in high sec story people should have sansha kuvakei use wormhole technology to steal concord ship plans from the jove enabling them to jam systemwide communications no concord response to capsuleer aggression in systems under incursion having income that secure and that high in high sec literally asphyxiates content in all other security bands at least nullsec ratters create content for people and are at risk for their daily income put another way we would never have seen the miracle of barleguet if all of those brave new players simply minmaxed risk vs reward and stayed in high sec doing l4s or incursions tech ii logi frigates need to be a thing many players would be very interested in flying one and the skill requirements should be forgiving enough so they can get into one as they would an assault frigate it is good that lots of good fleet doctrines use lots of lower sp ships lots of fun size ships are in good shape now but are always in need of some work the golden rule should be can a group of 510 friends who decide to play the game together after enough welping be able to field a good gang whatever new ships whatever new tags whatever new anything is released the core question should be will it create conflict will it be a resource people can fight over and a resource that will be in demand a lot of that is probably way above what one can do as a csm but at least you know where i stand after a few hours in thera it shows the promise of a barleguet style area that is linked to the whole universe UFFFD this idea was amazing and is fantastic for every part of the game
good guy  very effective communicator and csm will be getting my vote
sion was the first csm to contact me at the start of the term to chat with me reach out and get to know me i was highly impressed he invested time and shared sion can be critical and direct which is refreshing and he s not afraid to tell poeple stuff in their face internally and towards ccp if anyone stands uo there its him just like mynna i never seen him as a goon a decicated eve player and solid csm he would be on my vote list and i am looking forward to spend time with him in thr winetr summit
great job on proposing a software conversion tool for porting cobol programs as a solution for updating eves python and c code im sure with such expert knowledge as yours ccp will have no problem rewriting the entire server code base in a few monthssarcsmok serious mode now  while it might be refreshing to see someone newer on the csm who can bring fresh eyes how would you address some rather obvious gaps in your knowledge of the game what skills and attributes do you have in dealing with project managemant design consulting and communication 
never did i claim to be an expert but did you read the trsi software capabilities presentation they are capable of taking almost any code and updated it to a code that can handle multithreading and other capabilities that the current code does not have 
i disagreetaking away awoxing will retain a small  of new players who rage quit because of corp on corp losses on day 1  14 from griefers who are too scared to hop into deccing entities like marmite or jihad entities like code they love their risk free pvp on players who dont have enough skillpoints to know whats hitting themplayers in eve should never be 100 safe but bad mechanic was bad even if only for lolz like a titan aoe some might sayand lets not forgot that lol mechanism was nerfed into kingdom come because it was killing pvp for anybody who couldnt survive a hit from that moduleawoxing was killing trial account retention  conversion into full accounts which directly translated into less new players per anumas such if more subbed accounts  more players in a pvp game driven by combat then said removal has only strengthened eve
i admire your enthusiasm for balancing out the power but removing the csm is really just going to put eve back to the way it used to be when it was more like other games and ccp didnt hear the voices of the playerbase i think there really is less imbalance in allowing nullsec blocs to control the voting power than you think for instance it was not until the mittani went into the csm csm 6 that the game development took its major swerve away from adding new features and into fixing what was available he may have taken a little too much credit for everything that happened but his efforts were no doubt instrumental in things that most would say really benefited people outside of nullsec like the industrial and mining barge updates and while he didnt focus on the wormhole aspects he demonstrated that a player voice can matter and then there was an outpouring of voices which eventually led to the major turn toward giving wormhole gameplay some love in csm 8 and 9i think the best way to get good representation is to make sure everyone knows how to make their voice heard for newer or less experienced players which highsec has a larger number of that involves taking them under our wings one by one and showing them the ropes ive also seen a trend among the longer term highsec players in that many of them are unaware of what goes on in the rest of the game perhaps another big way to help get them contributing and taking advantage of the power they have is to make better ways of informing them maybe playerrun news corporations that control ingame banners in high security space but i think the biggest cause of unfair representation is uneven awareness of what a person can dopoor argument you havent compared battleships except for a generalized taunt that in a oneonone you believe you would win ship balance isnt all about oneonone fights and even when it is different pilots still have different skills ingame and as a player and different access to other valuable bonuses you winning against another ship in your battleship proves nothing about their viability statistically speaking battleships are underused in most pvpcombatheavy areas in eve
your post history is full of making gamebreakingly bad suggestions and little else1oh and a little tip defining yourself solely in opposition to something does not actually comprise having any substance since you pretty much have nothing but grr nullsec and your horrendously bad ideas to recommend you you might consider trying to stake out an actual position before running for csm
frakk yeahbring teh poniez
i also would like to see ponies on the moa
this thread isnt even two pages long and you missed something i have no hope of becoming a csm that is not why i am doing this i cant think of anyone that wasnt disappointed when they realised how flimsy battleships are the first timequite happy to settle for a vote of no confidence in a candidate and have struck out the lines that people seem to get so hung up onthis csm section should be linked in every local chat channel right now as a motd
i believe its in the rules that in order to run you must be prepared to win a seat if you want to express ideas to the csm there is the assembly hall for that if you wish to express ideas about the csm or candidates to other players who may be voters soon then you might better spend your time replying to the csm candidacy threads
if i accidentally win it i will take it most seriously i just find it highly improbable and am using the soap box while i have it
ive seen other candidates do that but most of them dont broadcast that little fact
i am one of those rare people honest completely unsuited for playing the game and smoozing up to people i get frustrated when people are playing silly social games and just want to get the job done thus i am a terrible politician but i might be the best bureaucrat you could ever hope for
steve you have the 1 vote on all of my accounts
beyond the restructuring of the csm which im not sure would really be a high priority what would be your priorities for in game the job of the csm is to act as a conduit between players and ccp having a sole focus of changing the way the csm works isnt doing that job
wow after all this time still running with the i know you are so what am i response think that will really win you the votes and yes i think any idiot could run a highsec corp which goes after easy targets theres literally nothing to run you dont have assets you dont need to worry about holding space you can just dock up if the going gets tough other than accepting recruits and kicking people out when they lose a ship you really dont have to do anything and i seriously doubt the good relationships based on the way people talk about marmite and yourself specificallyat the end of the day we dont need someone that acts like a child whenever they are criticised in the csm perhaps that works from running a nub alliance but it really doesnt work in the grown up world you can accuse me of making it up all you want but people can go ahead and look at the posting history of yourself and your alt general lemming and they can see the way you act if they really want to vote for that they have that choice but i doubt most people will should you by some miracle make it lets face it competition is weak this year i give it 2 meetings before ccp tells you to leave

corbexx like sugar has been an absolute workhorse on the csm this year he has worked ceaselessly on behalf of all wormhole dwellers and even extended that hardwork ethos to other player groupstypes within the eve communityhe will be high on my own ballot for a seat on csm x and he should be high on yours too
as the interviews for csm x candidates are starting to be done i will post the links in this thread as they are being published
to me this seems like a bad idea considering the time it seem to take new csm to get into the flow of their new responsibilities and figuring out who to contact when and where and this point i also have issue with i actually find it a fun part of the game to try and figure out alts and trying to trace groups forcing players to be open about all their alts would be a terrible for anyone wanting to play as a spy if you have a hard time cutting ties to groups there is no clean slate for you either as all your other characters are readily available for the world to see
i certainly understand that one can not like the idea but i do not believe that nothing can be achieved in one year by lack of contact information if this is actually a problem then a revolving tenure of two years with half of the members elected each year would address it my main point is to have only one tenure per player the current situation gives a significant advantage to players with a lot of financial resources they are the ones that can afford mutiple accounts to amongst other things infiltrate other groups hidden by the current system it is thus very easy to spy if you have the means nothing would prevent a player to be a spy even if the alts are made public it just makes it more difficult for a few high ressources players to fully control their spy network

youve been worth my vote in the past and you remain so in the future 
hi mikeamazingly i think ive checked like on this thread more than any other ever your ideas and mine seem to align quite closelyhaving said that id like to ask you some questions im asking the candidates im seriously considering if i couldspace has become littered with abandoned pos structures what is your position on getting rid of them id like to see perhaps a orbital degrading mechanic once the fuel is gone this then would open up the moons for pilots that will actually use them the current mechanic of course involves wardecing a possibly abandoned corp and then sitting there for an extended period of time blapping the structures i think something better is quite possibleeve seems to be popularly seen as more than a game perhaps moving into the hobby realm im aware that some discussions have been held with regard to finding a way to bring a more casual player or a more casual playstyle option into eve would you advocate this if so how might this be done without fundamentally changing the nature of the game would itit seems a given that csm x and ccp will look at dealing with the sovnull question this term beyond that from a gameplay perspective what would you advocate as the next priorityeve players seem to be quite passionate about the game yet it is said that the voting rate for csm elections is lower than that of even the united states midterms does this diminish the validity of the csm what would you like to do to combat the voter apathy that we see and effectively educate the voters on the reality of what the csm can effectively doadditionally i am friends with a legally blind capsuleer and someone else early in the thread brought up the issue of accessibility you responded to him saying that youre active and youll continue doing what you have done in the past for those of us newbros in the audience could you please expand on that or give us some reference links if you have themfinally and most importantly do you like cats thanks so much alan mathison explorer  industrialist star tide industries
but eves traditions and original founding wasnt based on a 100safety mindset though was it urziel to the contrary it was founded on htfu middle grounders who dont believe in an overriding eve constitution centered on htfu are destroying eve in slow paper cuts under the guise of such well rounded bs platitudes the point you are missing is that ccp is quite adept at slitting their own throats by themselves thank you very much without our socalled player representatives giving them cover to do itthe playercsm should be gandalf on the fckin bridge telling ccp you shall not pass whenever they go to implement any change that would decrease non consensual conflict from status quo mikes middleground mindset however is like gandalf saying ok you orcs are allowed to pass perhaps only one or two goblins too but i sure wont let the balrog passgosh no look at how balanced i am guysthere is no middle ground between food and poison protect the damned sandbox or at least be open and honest about your ultimate endgame of turning eve hisec into wow slowly over time hoping people wont notice what your really about with your balance self delusionwe have noticed the nerfs must stop no more focus on new content instead of breaking existing mechanics that create conflict and renounce our htfu traditionsf
strictly speaking this is not true more often than not whether a substance has toxic effects is a question of dosage and possibly ambient pressure it would be more accurate to say that there is only middle ground
in reverse    i have a maine coon watching me answer so yes i like cats she is a big cat dont want to cross herlegally blind is a tough one as there is going to be a limit where the video in video game will be hard to get around but i fight for ui ability to enlarge text icons that are easily distinguished and consideration of people with redgreen colour blindness this is something near and dear to me as my own vision begins to fade a lot of it comes down to having bigger clearer fonts and multiple clues as to what is going on so if you miss one another might catchdoes low voter turnout diminish our validity that depends on what you consider the measure of validity those of us who get elected should try their best to represent the players regardless of whether they were elected by 5 or 75 there is nothing in the white paper that says we can do a halfassed job if the voter turnout is low i do what i can to promote the election well especially since i am in it and hit the streets calling for not just votes for me but voting in general i have high hopes that ccp will do more to promote the election this year but 2 things are beyond my reach first it is in large blocks best interest if the voter turnout is small then the weight they swing can be more easily brought to bear so do not expect a lot of groundswell support from the larger alliances to get the vote out oh they will work hard internally but not with the population as a whole secondly i am one voice if you want to see a greater voter turnout then join in help get the word out and get corp mates fleet chat posts on the forums twitter whatever    do your part to educate your neighbour on the issues the candidates that there even is a bloody election the community as a whole needs to step up their game and not just look at the 30 candidates and ask    well why didnt you do more
isnt that what gandalf did i mean seriously he fought the big badbut that is aside from the point i am fairly sure i will not be getting you vote feyd and i am still ok with that if you think that i am trying to make highsec totally safe you are wrong but if you are supporting someone who wants to remove concord from the game so that highsec loses all safety then you are wrong againyou talk about balance like even the word leaves a bad taste in your mouthit shouldnt it is what makes this game viable it is what keeps both the predators and the prey coming back to the same watering hole oh toss about words like wow and disneyland all you like    making them the evil in the distance but please dont do it too loudly where ccp can hear because both of those ventures are multi billion dollar companies i am happy here with eve being a more balanced theres that word again here have a mint to get the taste out game with pvp and pve and every blend of them in between it is not black and white it is not 50 shades of grey it is all the colours visible and invisible eve is hard because it lacks simplicity and guidance in the form of handholding eve is fun for those same reasonsso you wont vote for someone who wants a balanced game finei am still running how did the last 2 code candidates do oh yeah    mmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
yet again the man that is mike throws his hat into the ring of csm elections and its followed very strongly by all my votesmike was a strong candidate for me last year being that we share similar play styles and being a fellow carebear now to the man behind the avatar i met mike at fanfest on sindels notacharitydinner along with a few other current csm members and what a lovely bloke hes very down to earth enthusiastic and keen to not only share his experiences but also to listen to what you have to say then things got a little blurry with drink and pub crawls pic or it didnt happen mike very well
ive seen discussion about an allnew pos replacement that wouldnt require hanging at a moon and furthermore wouldnt require that only one could hang at a moon its been a while but it stuck in my headthis seems like it would simultaneously make the deadstick phenomenon much worse at the same time that it would take away the real problem which is a dead stick occupying a valuable space that a live stick could have insteadim asking because i once explored a c2 with a whole bunch of dead sticks and it was like coming across an abandoned town all these ruins of boldly named corps with ambitiously optimistic descriptions hanging silently in space it was cool the last tower i found in the system still had a force field around it i like that ruins and ghost towns and abandoned houses are cool parts of the landscape especially when theres only enough left to make you wonder what once happened there
i dont think i will vote for you this time reason if there was no csm tag next to your picture i would have no idea you still are in csm
i appologize for my wording but you also didnt fully answer the question i can only assume that you oppose changes that put players in conflict in high security space is this correctto be clear i want a strong advocate for highsec pve players on csm but i do not want that to be at the expense of conflict drivers high sec pve is in a sorry state right now and the same content design is still running around from over ten years ago the burners are a step in the right direction but are poorly implemented by being included in current level 4 queues the difficulty precludes using them to introduce newer players to frigate combat and for players that enjoy the missions a large startup investment into battleships is requiredthe extreme repetition of missions is another issue and the fact that missions are still essentially go here kill target leads to very little diversity of gameplay between different missions add on the dry and immobile mission agents and you have an experience not worthy of a game going on 12 years of successfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information

no worries layered questions seem to be the theme on this campaign and i appreciate it when you try again if i seem to miss the question the first timehighsec should not be made safeit also should not be a free fire zone where the predators have all the advantagesthose two statements together should tick off a few people because they seem to think i need to believe in one or the other if you want for example to know how i feel about wardecs then go back to the declarations of war roundtable from last year i dont want them removed i just would like them to make sense conflict is an accepted part of eve but that does not mean it always have to have all the advanatages given to the hunter nor is all conflict done with guns and missilesyeah i have a blog called a missioneer in eve and still consider myself a carebear pve content is a part fo the game some may scoff at but a lot of folks play that aspect and it deserves attention as wellmbut it shouldnt be safe or predictable for either sidedo missions need a lot of love yes was i happy with burners and want to see more yes an i tired of rescuing that damn damsel yes would i like there to be more dynamio missions with a range of possibilities so eve survivbal cannot give you a wlakthrough hell yes have i asked for missions that see the kind of ship you have and give you missions made for the ship yupmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
your mistakenly taking my position to extremes mike i would never support removing concord heres the thing and i hope you can get where i am coming from on this and why i am so vehemently calling bs on the balance claimsfor the last three years ccp has already been implementing a pogrom of nerfing hisec in the minds of many content creators this has already swung the scales of balance well into the nerfdom side of the equation lets call this a 10 condition from statusquo htfu zerono really i am not making this up look herenow my problem with you mike like ripard teg before you is that you refuse to acknowledge that already present shift in the scales to 10 and you just look at each new additional nerf proposed by ccp and nod sagely saying that sounds balanced in a vacuumthe problem mike is that real true balance would be to seek to tip the scales back from that preexisting 10 nerfdom to htfu zero and implement some buffs to nonconsensual conflict in hisec ostensibly by closing wardec dodging mechanics etcnow this 10 condition has been mentioned numerous times so at this juncture it must be willful ignorance on your part thus invalidating your claims of balance thus we see revealed another ripard tegian carebear seeking to nerf the hell out of hisec while seeking moral cover under the bs guise of nice guy being balancedprotect the damned sandbox undo the damage already done to conflict creation that would be real balance mikef
feyd oh how i would love to hear you and dinsdale debate each of you tyaking the side that highsec is being nerfed into the gorund but from opposite viewpointsand nobody hears things said in a vacuum i love your blog about nerfing highsec though dont agree with parts of it but it was fun to readif ripard and i have joined forces to nerf hisec nonconsensual content in hisec into the groud then all ganking has stopped   op successum nope i looked and it is still going on people are still shooting people niarja is still a place you move through quickly and carefully maybe loophole kills are lower tricking people into being easy targets due to convoluted rules i think that is a good thing you are allowed to disagreemmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
its the dismal tide mike its not the one thingwe see in macro micro and yes eves virtual world that freedom is lost in small paper cuts over time as soon as people stop actively defending it and equivocating or rationalizing to find middle ground i would quote edmund burke here but whats the pointits not the one thing i will close with this if ccp wants to make hisec a secondshard 100 disneyland at the sacrifice of player freedoms they should just be upfront and honest about it as should you you cant do it over small increments like ripard teg and others before you and hope people dont notice feigning ignorance along the way on all the preceding nerfs while proclaiming a balanced approach again at this point true balance would be restoring some buffs to hisec aggression to take us back from that 10 nerf condition to htfu zeroyou wont because you are a bear and there is no real balance its just that i am calling bs on you have every right to try and turn hisec into wow and disneyland with small continual papercut nerfs but you do not get to do it while proclaiming ignorance you are doing itf

and thnx i now see part broke of the original postcsm10 when i started csm was something i always wanted to do much like owning a titan building a station owning sov kill supers it turned into much more a way to express love for eve respect for the people that build it and a way to make a voice heard that wants to help eve into the next decade i never thought i would like to run again but i will if providence region keeps appreciating me as their representive also for next year ofcourse itUFFFDs not just your alliance and friends i have gotten so much votes from frends reds people who believe null sec is more than 2 blocks nailing each other too the wall small scale pvp localized conflicts occupancy based sov and income build local sell local close communities and the this is eve feeling expressed in the awesome new video winter summit and fanfest are still too come and have offered the opportunity too attend them both which is epic i met more people this year than in a entire eve lifeof all sorts and sizes and met unexpected friends and enemies so make sure you vote for csm 10  last year my election was a surprise too many this year lets show this wasnUFFFDt a one time event i will be running again for a null sec outside the major blocks for a daily skirmisch based game play where you donUFFFDt just login when you get a jabberping where 1 big war is replaced by 1015 localised ones where fatique matters and adds a tactical layereve is a niche game cut throat insanely caring and one hell of a rush call me a eve addictcu in fanfest2015  eversterdam 2015 provi kopenhagenthis all broke off so i edited it and tried to add spaces i didnt even know blanc space didnt take up character spacei hope its better now and u can aprove
thats where you are wrong were not perfectionists english isnt my maternal1st language and im quite certain many other people arent primarily english speakers eitherbut if someone has to post 23 times to actually get a response means core isa unwilling to respond  thats actually the worst option out of the twoorb incapable to respond due to a language barriertheres no shame in asking for help this is a multiplayer game after all were all hopefully grownups and can converse constructivelyas far as grammar punctuation and spelling goes im sure youre all familiar with the example of i helped my uncle jack off a horse and i helped my uncle jack off a horseprops to core for paragraphing his original post though and adding the missing piece it reads better than it did before

retracted question as it has been answeredsidestepped already
thanks for all the support and replies if anyone has any has any questions im happy to answer them
asked a couple questions a couple pages back but i think they were lost in the post attributing other players actions to you so i will just ask againwhat would you change about t3s and ishtarsdo you think the rise in opness of t3s and ishtars is attributable to the fact that bcs natural cruiser hunters are essentially garbage currentlywhat are your thoughts on bcs and bssi remember back in 0910 there was a nice little food chain hacst3  bs  bc  hacst3 imo it seems that food chain is dead these days
ditto for me
communication is key to the csm so im behind that completely
commander aze for csm10so i appreciate those who voted for me in the csm9 campaign and would like to once again throw my hat in the ring as eve is an ever changing game i have moved from high sec into null sec i am still passionate as ever about fixing high sec for those that are there the expansion of content for incursions in another major focus of mine as we all know there are changes being discussed about eves future tower and sovereignty mechanics i wonUFFFDt pretend to be an expert in understanding the current mechanics but i am often confused at mechanics as they stand i am not alone in thisso who am i former high sec industrial corp director former high sec war dec corp ceo incursion runner tdfformer cup fcformer ecio jr fcformer battlement coalition fcserenity initiative fc manager of a ton of posnotable eventsslaughter of ct8kbattle of asakaispys taking down s2n citizenslaughed at tests defense of fountainbattle of brhigh sec fleet lc for ghost site launch those that joined the amarr fleet UFFFD sorry broshunt for caldari officials dread kills in high secso why do i want to try this again because someone has to ask the questions that are not being discussed high sec war decs neutral logistics logi on killmails support for multi alliance communities like tdf or incursion shiny alliance level bookmarks for the eft warriors out there more than 200 fits reaffirming the place and purpose of the csm itUFFFDs important to note that there was a 33 drop in voting from the previous year statistically more people play eve than the year before and that number keeps growing however less and less are voting for the one of the most important groups to represent the players getting the csm to have diversity and some new blood is a great way to go to get some new opinions and maybe ask some questions that havenUFFFDt been brought up beforerefocusing on the new player experience and getting players funneled out of newbie corps and into player run corps making things easier to understand is key here i remember as a new bro i had no idea where the overview was for a solid 20 minutes the first time i undocked supporting occupancy based sov and the ability to change the sov you are using the current mechanics are based on large hp related grinds that can be physically painful to sit through and silly in a lot of ways i think some of the ideas being discussed have some merit in what null secs future is and in breaking up the massive blocks of somewhat unused space for smaller groups to create content feel free to ask questions below

domanark for csm 10i am running for the csm for the first time i think the csm program is a great idea and opportunity the players are given to voice ideas complaints and offer opinions of ccps ideas no matter what the original reason for creating the csm it has slowly become a very important aspect to this game i do feel the last few csms have really stepped up and moved the program forward in a very positive way i think i could be an asset to continue this momentum who am ii have been playing eve without any breaks since 2010 i have subscribed 3 accounts since i started playing 2 combat characters and 1 industrial characterstarted out my eve experience by joining fw right away i was a member of draketrain when there were in caldari fw then wolfs brigadei left fw to join with sev3rance when they were in the north supporting morsus mihi fought along with those alliances in the northern coalition i was with sev3rance for their return to providence during that time i also had a character in rvb where i was one of the many recruitersleft 7 to join up with test because as everyone else once i could fly capital ships i wanted to give it a try stayed with test until they were defeated by the cfc our corp decided not to follow test into lowsec but instead repaired relations with the local fountain core groups and stayed there to harass the owners of the area helped our corp technology establish the alliance sorry were in your space ehduring this time i help create and cohost the eve podcast clueless space nerds i have been cohosting this podcast for the past year and have occasionally appeared on a few other podcasts my involvement in the eve community continues to increase i have been to several meet ups and have hosted an eve meet up myself with plans for more i continue to support programs like the pod and planet fan fiction contest and have my own eve blogwhile all this was happening i had moved my rvb character to the rifterlings a lowsec newplayer friendly piratey style corpcurrently i am still with the rifterlings and my main character is with black legionmy industrial character has been active in manufacturing of modules and ships both t1 and t2 i have successfully ran reaction towers for profit i also have quite a bit of experience with bpo researchi am running for the csm not because i feel the current members have not done a good enough job but because they have their success has inspired me to want to be a part of this process and i feel my experiences both in eve and in real life make me well qualified to bring a fresh and positive perspective to the csmi am running on a platform ofsupporting a continuation of the positive directions the new point release system has given us so fari believe the community of eve is as important to the game as the content itself i would like to see a growth in the relationship between the players the player run community functions and ccp player run meet ups podcasts blogs and fan fiction is a healthy and vibrant community i think sometimes this contents existence isnt always readily communicated effectively to the playerspirate and bounty system changes made were a step in the right direction but i will advocate the continued focus on these areas as to make piracy more exciting and dangerous and to make bounty hunting a more viable choice for players to make iski will advocate the continued ship balancing and tweaking that has been done so far but also support the addition of not only new ships but new ship classesi will support a occupancy based sov system i have in fact offered several ideas on this matter these ideas can be found at my blog site warp and jumpi will support the effort to make the new player experience one that engages entertains and stimulates new players without taking away the aspect many who play the love the most the difficulty level one of the greatest draws this game as always offered is the fact it is hard unforgiving and complex these aspects separate it from most other games and bring in a player base of more intelligent and mature peoplei believe my platform is one that can and will support high low and nullsec while i find wormhole space absolutely awesome my lack of real concrete experience doesnt lend to me being a credible wh candidatelastly and most importantly i will be running on a platform of being a player representative i will bring the ideas and opinions of the groups of players to the conversation as the subject dictatesplease feel free to ask me any questions here on the forums or you can send me an ingame mail or you can contact me on the podcast homepage
i welcome your campaign i love your cast and listen to it regularlycheck out my podcast my blog
i am interested to see that you have experience managing corporations i assume that you have a great deal of input to provide ccp about the interfaceyou say that you are a voice for the voiceless it is true that there has not been a hauler on csm in my term as a player what do you feel is not being heard what should ccp hear about hauling is there some way in which it is inadequate or do the haulers simply feel buffeted by changes are you a reformer or an advocate or both
hello aigelethe corporation interface has a major learning curve the reason this is the case though is because it grants the directorceo the ability to control in intricate detail every single move that takes place between a member and hisher corporation this level of ability is obviously a good thing and the array of option that upper management has truly is remarkable and realistically necessary the complexity of this though is what often leaves most choosing to go with very basic setups and then having to micro manage member to member roles as they come and ive seen the complaints by some about this ultimately though its entirely up to a member of upper management whether they wish to utilize the full capabilities of the controls going through all the ranks for all the based ats for all the takequery and hundreds of boxes to click etc or if they wish to white wash their setup and this is not the fault of ccp the only thing that i could see being of more help with this then is if there were some kind of tutorial in game explaining all of the options and what they mean the huge learning curve in eve from which the expression you lose your noobcard after playing eve for 2 years is a part of what makes it such a great game so my suggesting a tutorial for this keeps the richness of options while also giving the player a better chance at understanding what she is looking ati believe each of the industrial professions and gunship playstyles should have representation i also believe that the 4 spaces should have representation as well one of the industrial professions hauling has not had its own personal representative and at base root given the powerful necessity of logistics i believe these players simply deserve a representative thats the foundation of my campaign and why i decided to run for csm 10 beyond that there are a number of things that need to be reexamined so yes you could label me as an advocate and reformer on the reforming side there has been quite a lot said towards that end obviously theres a lot of information on this thread so ill point you to 2 examples that stand out as examples of reform post 22  post 32 i also have another point of reform besides those two posts quoted hereso the combination of these potential reforms and the large industry of hauling needing its own representative are the essentially the summation of my platform i am very interested in helping eve overall though and offering my perspective on other issues that will appear as well i hope this satisfactorily answers your questions aigele  and thank you for choosing to participate in this thread with them rl

mike thank you
im glad you backed down from the delete csm positioni would also be more worried about overrepresentation of sov nullsec powers if they were abusing the privilege but as long as they send thoughtful people with an eye on the big picture which is one thing that their lofty perch gives them access to it seems more like an academic question to merooks and kings are infamousespecially in wake of the latest promotional videofor pipebombing which seems more like an example of the suddenly dead pvp that you dislike than any sort of standup brawl also how do you nerf alpha when its mostly a function of the number of ships until very recently beam lasers had terrible alpha individually and its still not great but if you get enough of them to fire simultaneously at a target it will evaporate just as surely as if you used tornadoes you just need more of them fleet alpha is a significant design problem in eve but im not sure that youre coming at it from the right angle especially in terms of ease of implementationthe only time ships just appear on grid is if you undock or jump onto a grid where theyre already there otherwise you can see them on dscan and situationally in local the basic survival strategies of setting standings and using dscan are regrettably not taught to new players by the game itself is there a reason you prefer mechanical nerfs to attacks that are already in progress instead of putting greater emphasis on teaching situational awarenessi understand how an abstain vote would have semantic value especially if you could specify a reason but im reasonably sure that a vote of no confidence would be terribly abused see also the lack of a dislike button on the forums by precisely the blocs that youre worried about is that a larger problem than the apparent disinclination of most of the game to participate at all
a high sec industrialist candidate yeswill you be doing any of the interview podcasts
hatsnuff said
ill interview with pretty much anyone ive not arranged anything yet due to a chest infection dont like coughing in peoples ears but once thats cleared up you should be hearing my dulcet tones abusing your ears
and on the subject of gankers is there anyone out there that would want to tell me what that particular crowd might view as important for the next year
i take csm more serious then this
corbexx has been one of the most impressive ambitious and committed csm delegates and players ive had the pleasure of working and corresponding with during my time in eve he has always been honest and straight forward in his communication with the community and has always been available and made time for questions support and dialogue he will certainly be at the very top of my ballots this year and will be my first recommendation to anyone within or without the wormhole communityits dedicated and driven player delegates that help to ensure that the various members and playstyles within this great community are heard and in my interactions with developers such as interviews and player gatherings ive learned firsthand the impact that our csm delegates notably corbexx have had on this game best of luck my friend
as a director in a small industrial corp based in a lower class wormhole for more then 4 years i can say we have cheered at the small improvements in wormhole life that have been implemented in the game in the last half year or soi can safely say the entire corp is glad with things like the consistent sig names the separated dscan window and so forth small things yes but for me in this case its those little details that make the difference between good and great i thank you for the effort you put into getting all the little wormhole improvements prominently on the table and convincing the rest of the csm and ccp it would be worthwhile to implement themthis year just like last year you will be no 1 on my list and i am sure i can convince at least some of my corpmates to do the samehere i used to have a sig of our old camper in space now it is disregarded as being the wrong format looking out the window i see one thing nothing wrong with the format of our camper silly ccp

i may be the eic but xander phoena is my boss and handles pay at cz so im voting for him im a lowsec poor and will sell my vote to the highest bidderjoking aside xander stood on a platform of communication and politically independent improvement of eve online through the will of the community his conduct and work during csm 9 have proven that he delivers on both points if you vote for xander you are not voting for a political bloc you are voting for a truly independent conduit for the players ive seen xander go the extra mile to bring issues from the community to ccps table even ones that had absolutely zero to do with him as a player he as without fault reported on the work csm are doing every week through cz whilst being accessible in all manner of waysxander has his finger on the pulse of the community better than most and i would recommend anyone to vote for him 1nmoira corp  villore accords  gallente militia  lowlife on crossing zebras  nidengmva
in addition because i was brought aware of this today when i watched the o7 show apparently i can add keeping ccp neutral in regional conflicts to my list of issues to raise as a representative otherwise it was a great show despite the sound issue early on
hurrah for sion
first of all how do i pronounce your new name the english or the french waysecondly what do you think is the most important issue facing the playerbase today and how do you believe it should be addressed
1 pronounce my name whichever way is easiest for you 2 that is a difficult question because each player plays the game differently so each player has their own most important issue that they want addressed industrialists will have much different issues than wormhole roaming pvpers who in turn play the game differently from incursion runners but if i had to chose one i would say that new player retention is the most important issue facing the playerbase today improving this would affect all aspects of new eden for the better giving us more sand for this sandbox for one example i will take small gang pvp as an example over the last few weeks i have been running a chat channel called pvp and piracy help whose main goal is to get new players started down the life of a pvper we talk with them answer questions and try to help them get a good understanding of the game mechanics a lot of the players i talk to have very little knowledge but are very eager to go out and learn many have been recruited by fw corps that do not explain the mechanics or drawbacks of participating in fw others are recruited by 00 corporations that say move all your stuff out to our system without explaining the mechanics of bubbles clones or bookmarks it would be nice if there was a default chat channel they could go to if interested in getting into learning the basics of pvp there are channels for ratting and real estate but not for pvp
new player retention is indeed an issue facing eve so to expand on that i have a few questions the first experience of many new players is the recruitment efforts of highsec corps near the starter system while many of these corps mean well a large fraction of them are run by ceos with an incomplete understanding of eve mechanics who lets face it run lessthanstellar organizations that are not capable of properly supporting and teaching new players about the game new players ending up in these lackluster corporations will have a more frustrating initial experience in the game than if they ended up in a better corporation and might quit the game altogether this problem is set to become worse with the recent changes allowing the spamming of corporation invitations and the proposed removal of intracorp agression in highsec which will remove a major disincentive to farm new players for income that is the possibility of highsec awoxingwith that in mind i have three questions 1 what do you think the best approach would be to get new players into quality corporations with the real interest and capability to train new players not just in highsec but also in low null and wormhole space 2 do you agree with the proposed removal of intracorp aggression in highsec 3 do you think that a social corp mechanism  that is a new tier of corporation that is immune to wardecs and awoxing but has none of the current advantages of a player corporation is a good idea to increase new player retention
thanks for throwing your hat in the ringof late theres been a huge push by both ccp and by player corps and alliances to respond to the huge wave of new players that have come in as a result of the this is eve promotional video as a veteran of new player friendly alliances agony in particular do you think theres a way to sustain this level of attention and helpfulness it seems to have been able to get new players right into the heart of the gamealmost immediately in the case of brave newbiesand that can only be good but can it be sustained
dradiswelcome to the csm x campaign and congratulations on taking a step to involve yourself in the process to be the change you want to see in the game many players generally prefer to only complain about issues as opposed to step up and take charge by joining or attempting to join the group that will work to help solve them so as longwinded and tedious as this campaign may be for you and other candidates youve taken the first step and that deserves a note of recognitionon that note some advice be involved in the various discussions features and ideas general discussions etc join the gambit of social media reddit twitter skype etc provide multiple avenues of communication evemail character gmail twitter skype when listing issues provide examples and prospective solutions npe highsec jita etc communicate with current and former csm delegates ask for guidance learn from them be visible answer questions keep your head get involved in the campaign process get involved in the interviews debates and podcasts there is certainly more but id bet that you can figure much more out by getting involved with other candidates and csm delegates to learn more and better solidify your run for csm i also noticed that you said you have issue with new player skills and fittings what type of information would you like to see added to tutorials for skills how would you prefer to see that implementation and how specific should a skills tutorial be when saying so many stats which stats are you referring to that you believe couldshould be clearercompacted please provide a top list of the following a what are your top 5 favorite things to do when playing eve pvp mission running mining b what are your top 5 must haves for eve as a player c what are your top 10 wishlist items that youd like to see should you be elected d what are your top 10 issues with eve that youd like to see fixed e what are your top 3 gameplay items that youd remove in eve awoxing wardecs supers mining etc
the whole point of this is to make it harder to move any fleet around to make you spread your forces out more to defend the same territory how many alliances actually use every system they claim sov to how many have almost no presence other than the tcus i have been in null and most players use jump bridges as a crutch in null i am not saying this is bad per se but i am saying that given the choice most use the jump bridge network for day to day traffic that made the game a lot easier than it was probably intended to be i mean there was no real need to even go into some of the systems that the alliances have sov over i can even get using some of them as a buffer zone for defense purposes but that really has no meaning if no one is there to spot the roam i think that add fatigue to both caps and jbs was a good choice it will make alliances have to pick and choose where the station fleets now instead of 1 massive fleet you may have 3 or 4 talking a mid sized alliance here large alliances may get into the teens on numbers of fleets fleets stationed at different points in your territory for defense this should make for much more interesting combat as opposed to you dumping everything you can find on short notice on any roam
so you would ignore any indy corps you have working wih you their contribution means nothing i am an indy pilot and while i do not have problem with sov based on military might i would hope that ccp would want to give you other ways to help secure a system what you are saying is the guy with the biggest fleet wins while that is true for battles it is not true for wars speaking in rl not in eve atm in rl the guy that can keep producing the weapons of war and warriors wins i am not saying make it indy necessary i am saying that make its contributions applicable you dont think they should be because you are about pvp who builds the ships you fly upgrades your stations etc i would like ccp to make it not where you have to do ratting mining etc to secure a system but where they contribute to the security do you want to have to let your fleet sit in every system you own to maintain your sov or would you rather let the indy side of your alliance handle their own so that you only have to maintain the systems the have a strategic advantage but no real industrial one just saying why make our contributions null make your life easier
what about ships which are undocking and are under 30 seconds invulnerability timer
my reply might be a bit short and sharp i am in space so my attention is split and it is getting late here bear with me pleasei doubt most of the csm do it deliberately for the most part people see themselves as good people doing good things rel derailment food deleted however when you live in a certain place be it a city country or type of space you naturally develope a familiarity and a bias you make decisions based on the experience you have had and the freshest of thoseas i see it the problem is two fold1 null has voting blocks and coalitions vote for their representative for the most part rather blindlythe inverse is that high sec is split up scattered and hardly knows each other2 the other sectors of space dont know or have lost hope of being represented in csmthe vote against option would allow them to nullify the first part of the problem then knowing that and putting coming forward to stand for their type of space would rely on ccp informing them properly through motds in local and the launcherthe pipe bombing is a tool that will hopefully have a counter found by the players or coded however the root of it is that it is a small group that stand toe to toe with much larger foesalpha i have been thinking that either there is a delay where logi have a chance to respond preventing a one shot or you can link your fleet in someway to dissipate energy and spread the damageas i said in another thread i have slow boated between two book marks across asteroid anomolies in worm hole space ready to warp at a moments notice while hitting that horrible dscan over and over again  that is not fun there should be manual dscan with quicker results and a slower auto dscan like auto pilot some drawback to itso i would say a bit of both i like some darwinism but i like good tools for people to use also71 of active pilots are in high sec eve essentially is a high sec game a fair amount of them might be null sec alts but they would not exist without a purpose there my belief is that the null blocs might vote me to 0 repeatedly because i antagonise them and am not charismatic but i still think that if high sec felt empowered then they would knock some nulls down to a level that is more competitive and vote up some of their own
i support your position on changing voting mechanics to allow players to vote against but you will still end up with null blocs just voting as a bloc against certain individuals instead of for individuals and since it is a runoff either way ls hs and wh candidates will be eliminated by the combined efforts of ns block votingthat being said there is nothing wrong with having ns bloc voting but i think that ccp and csm should encourage a format change where only a certain number of regional representatives can be voted in a set number of spots for each region ns 2 hs 2 ls 2 wh 2 for example this allows people who arent being spoonfed a vote to target representation that reflects them instead of simply picking from a list of names in a hat essentiallyas for alpha any reduction to it should be met by an equal nerf to logistics as the only way to counter the logistical capability of fleets is to use enough alpha to eliminate ships before reps land if you eliminate alpha strikes then what is stopping half the people who used to fly alpha ships from flying logi you end up with 2 unkillable fleets fighting each otherwhich makes the change redundantthats my 2 cents on your issues good luck in your campaign
thank you i have no further arguments for the first half of your post the voting could go either way but at least if we tried a new system then we triedpossibly the energy spread trick could be linked to the logi they could sacrifice one or maybe two high slots to be used as absorb slots instead and lock onto targets with them any damage to them would be shared with the logi locked on examplethe fc is yellow boxed by 100 tengus that are all doing 1000 volley and he has a pure 85k ehp with 0 resists for the purpose of making the example simple now with 100 000 damage incoming he would be completely wiped out in one shot however he warns the logistics and some say 1025 of them are quick enough to lock him with the absorb damage module some of them are already damaged and dont risk it some are locking others incase of target changes etcso he takes 50 of that damage and is left with 35k ehp the ten logi each take 5 000 direct damage since it is a module on their ship that is relaying the damage it is direct and by passed their resistsnow they will have to repair each other repair the further dps the fc will take turn off some of their absorb modules to not die themselves and are doing this while only being 75 as effective at repairing as they were before but they saved their fc and the fight goes onedit now like previously you can argue that a fleet of 100 logi would keep one guy alive and you would end up with two fleet like that however eve players find the counters for example more damage per second and less volley attacking the logi laughing at how little damage the other side does or jamming the logi with ecm
but the same can be said of the current metrics in game to limit alpha there are a pile of ways to mitigate alpha damage one current method that is being enjoyed in large fleets currently is heavy focus on ewar namely damps if you can spread damps on enough ships to the point they can no longer target your fleet with any reliability then you have already reduced the effectiveness of an alpha doctrine on the other side of the coin you can apply those same damps to logi and reduce their effectiveness in engagements where you are not in an alpha fleeti personally dont see the issue requiring any large change because ultimately the problem will always come down to n1 regardless of the mechanics at work group a and group b are bound to the same rule set and thus in an everything being equal environment at the end of the day the only difference is who can bring more dudes to a fightas for the idea itself of limited targeting or spreading of damage i think it is quite gimmicky i dont see the realism in a ship taking hits for other ships or inversed ships damages being mitigated based on the number of ships firing at others in my honest opinion the balance is there already and if you bring the wrong fleet to the wrong engagement then that is the chance you take when you undock and engage
 and so tengu fleet vs tengu fleet  ishtar fleet vs ishtar fleetcurrent meta but ehp and damage are the two you keep going for passive tanks active tanks etc there are so many varieties never mind ships that are entirely side lined because they pop far too easily
 for null sec voting blocks to have less powerdo you hate democracyif nullsec has too much power it is because nullsec along with wbros and lowsec are the ones that care about this game enough to engage into spacepolitics and influence the gameplaymost people in highsec play eve like if the ships around them were part of the landscape they wouldnt even notice if eve became offlineso why would we have to give the power to people that essentially want to kill this game slowly
i think democracy in the real world is a farce the most gullible people vote for a few charismatic faces that dont care about themwe have no voting power over the bureacracy and no real way to stop the corporations that control and bribe themthe next step would be some form of technocracymy contention is that they are simply formed into bigger groups with a few recognisable people within them why highsec doesnt manage this could be down to many reasons such as the systems being too barren or they dont face enough conflict or there are not enough defendable pipes and dead ends or or orworm holes are split off from each other they are like tribes in a jungle who if they meet anyone else there automatically have to assume they are hostile they cant form friendships with their neighbours because their links keep changinglow sec  well that is just a waste land considering the number of systems and the population it is worse than null seci am not sure how to make low sec more sustainable and i do not think there is a cure for worm holes but i do believe that they should have tools to give them all a fighting chance and null sec will have access to the very same tools it will be impartial in that way
you have to also support what your voters want if you dislike the way the csm itself is run and the way votes are cast then youll find the majority of your voters among those who already arent voting so to get more popularity the best thing to do is to spread your campaign around the areas that are opposed to the csm youve got to get the word out to the right peoplecorebloodbrothers campaigned in support of nrds and gained votes by passing his campaign in front of providence residents for instance
good advicestatistically 47 of the eve population is female90 of my voting base is femalewhile i agree that i should expand my reach to those who have already given up on the system in terms of voting i also think statistically it makes the most sense to dedicate the limited resources i have to the female eve demographic
so what exactly is your plan for reformanyone can stand on a soap box and point at everyone else on their soap boxes and say they are doing it wrong so vote for me

i am crying xd
fewer crunchies and more dancing eh clearly this campaign just got real

how do you feel about making a wardecs cost based on the number of people in both corporations ie the more people involved the more expensive it is in total but the less expensive it is per person
you have all of my votes

ive scheduled my interview with capstable for the start of next month thank you for the kind words and questions i appreciate and thank you for the support
my name is damishu and i support this message
hmm i dont want to be part of a fight i dont play simply to make my wallet larger and dont partake in chaos and hilarityas a permanent highsec dweller you want to deprive me of any developerlove and yet you ask for my voteyou claim that thera is a wonderful ideai assume that this means you will spend a lot of time theregood
my name may have a funny spelling but im here to do some serious work i am psianh auvyander and im a member of noir mercenary corporation ceo of noir academy training corporation and i am here to represent smallmedium sized organizations new players and mercenaries across the game universe i strongly believe eve is a game based around risk reward conflict collusion coercing and relationships and  perhaps most importantly  fun and i will work to maintain and improve upon those tenantsim running for csm x because i can continue the great work that has been done and build upon it further im running because i will to be a representative for players across new eden available willing and determined to get your opinions and feelings across to ccp i will have an open dialogue with players from all playstyles welcoming conversations about what you want what you like what you dont like and what you dream of i will communicate with you and for you to make new eden better next year than it is this yearive spent years working professionally and as a volunteer as a community manager i have the skills and experience required to efficiently collect present defend and fight for concepts and ideas ill leverage those skills to ensure that the csm retains the voice of the players and that ccp hears it since january 2013  with a short break  ive maintained the ceo position of noir academy a pvp training organization ive been a member of noir since 2011 playing as a mercenary fighting in nullsec lowsec highsec and wormhole space its vital that eve continue to be an environment where independent organizations can make a path for themselves this is the true eve dreamill work for you as a csm member and ill work for your vote now feel free to ask me anything you like on this thread on twitter  or by email psianhauvyandergmailcom my responses to your questions will be aggregated onto the post below
low sec questionnairecap stable interviewjust for crits csm analysis on my campaigncsm vote match page
1 for psianh ive trusted him in leadership positions for years and hes never let me down if youve voted for me or mynxee or ali aras in the past know your vote for psianh will continue that awesome tradition
1 for psianh here a quality guy with a sound mind his decisions and ideas will be vital to csm 10 and im sure many others would say the samebuhhd
psianh is the definition of approachable friendly and down to earth combining those qualities with his effort and knowledgebase it becomes near impossible to find a reason not to have him at the top of your ballot ive had the great privilege of csm related discussion and interaction in the past and psianh has always been honest and upfront about his views while being available and openmindedwish you the best during your campaign and look forward to seeing you succeed and support the community this year on csm x psianh
improving corporations is a good start and i am anxiously waiting to see what ccp will do with that there will always be non quality corporations that actively recruit new players there is nothing you can or should do about that in a sandbox but information for new players is extremely important increasing the amount of game knowledge gained from the new player experience the tutorial needs to constantly be improved and updated i would personally love to have a new pvp tutorial for new players that sends them out into lowsec or 00 to get fights high sec intracorp aggression is mostly used as a griefing mechanic if you want to  over your corporation there are still plenty of ways to do it if you want to practice pvp then you can duel a corp mate a social corp mechanism would just be abused to avoid highsec wars i have done incursions and the community seems to function fine even though many of the players who fly with bling are wardecced
yes it most definitely can a lot of the time in eve the more players that you have the stronger you are so it is smart play to make sure you always have a steady recruitment of fresh blood
im not sure why i find myself partially quoted here the original post was based on if the bowhead was fit for the purposes that ccp was promoting it for
so you dont believe that ganking is very cheap
a socializing isnt the same as joining a corp but judging by the stupidity of what is going on in npc corps i cant blame people and ccp for saying that joining a corp is better b only stupid  indy corps do get wardecceda friend of mine miner by heart has been in an indy corp for nearly 3  35 years nowand only once saw a wardec which was when he just joinedits those that make themself a target in one way or another that get wardecced
all miners already have a 99 chance of winning a gank attempt the fight starts long before my guns start firingi am a lion i have set up camp in a region i have scouted it out of all the miners i have selected you to engage solo why is that because you are a sickly gazelle i saw you stumble while i was hidden in the grassthe big strong tanked procurers and skiffs and even well tanked rets and macks won our engagement before it even started i scanned everybody checking for a weak tank or antitank i checked your bio for antilion propaganda their shields warded me off and their bios while not positive and compliant were at least neutral so they remain safe i have no reason to call in the rest of my pride to send a message others in my region will continually bring concord to protect them or post falcon sentries to jam me or camp the gates to protect their pocket some will keep an eye on local and watch for my scout they will warp off before i get there the fact that i started firing on you means that i have pegged you as a wounded gazelle who is too focused on eating the grass look up once in a while would you the ones i gank voluntarily gave up their 99 chance in favor of yield that choice has consequences that is what eve is all aboutnow then you do seem a bit confused about some of the mechanics and what goes into ganking i hereby invite you to try it out for yourself i dont believe you can fairly take this antiganking position as a csm candidate without having explored what actually goes into successfully suicide ganking somebody that 50 thing is nonsense but because you havent seen it from our end you wouldnt know prove you have an open mind gank something bargeexhumere to be honest i dont trust you enough to tell you what i find important as a ganker whats stopping you taking that and just running an an antiwhatever i say platform you need to prove yourself first the info is already out there thoughe2 the above edit seems like a real problem for a highsec candidate
so if i have to go pee i have to log not cloak if i have to run downstairs to fetch a pizza i have to log not wait in a station if i have to drive my son to school which only takes a few mins i have to log not sit in a posi guess i have to be happy that youll allow me to stay online for 20 mins without activitynow for real if you want people to be online and active have ccp build a timer into the client if theres no action for 20 mins have it closed too extreme thought so
but i like afk cloaking
i too wish to vote for someone scared of disclosing his main
borat is my main public altcharacter i am glad to see you are in favor of plublicly displaying all alts of a player as you would only vote for someone knowing the alt you want to see there is no reason for me to put out my alts out at the moment and this is part of my program so surely you can get behind that to vote for me if indeed the disclosing of alts become public as i am supporting then you will be able to see all my alts everyone applying for the csm put forward their public alt so there is no difference unless you prefer judging a candidate not on the ideas they support but on some other base i prefer focusing on ideas myself
its funny to watch you chestbeat and whine about sandbox gameplay when you seem to forget the fact the sandbox sword cuts both ways targets have just as much right to use any and all available mechanics to evade your intentions as you do to try to imbalance any encounters neutral rr nonwar target boosts etc they dont pay a sub to amuse you
you seem to know who i am enough to have followed my posting history well enough to know where i was posting last year as for yourself clearly you made no lasting impression thats even more embarrassing the fact that youre floating around this thread patting sabriz on the back and shiptoasting at critics like some kind of lackey really shows how far youve fallenand sure i dont mind bumping the thread of anyone running at the end of the day i actually believe that people will make the right decisions when posting their votes if they really want to vote for someone intent pushing for self serving changes who refuses to even acknowledge a huge portion of the playerbase as existing purely because their post happened to appear recently posted in more often then they can i think most people will read the campaign outline and consider the author then realise it would be pretty dumb to vote for sabriz
persistant shiptoasters tend to stand outin breaking news supporters of a csm candidate were spotted posting supportive things in their candidate thread today
greetings sabrizmy issue is this eve is an mmorpg a massively multiplayer online role playing game yes so many lost souls in this game neglecting the mm and g aspects of eve are both huge problems problems we have both dedicated ourselves to fixing but what of the rp part of it all too often role play is neglected and even maligned my thorough investigation into the csmx campaign an advanced search of these forums for role play yielded no valid results there is nobody else willing to represent or help the roleplayers you are our only hope will you take a brave stand in favour of role playtisiphone dira knight of the new order and right hand of james 315
its a sandbox and roleplayers are welcome but its not a roleplaying game in any way
which part of mmorpg made you think that
how about a rotten egg  that pretty much sums up intention of gankers they are playground bullies and they want their profession  ganking to be the only safe one in highsec ganking is either a profession or a form of griefing because without the profit ganking reduce to destroying other players ships and clones for no gain griefing is a bannable offense so lets be merciful and consider ganking as a professionand its completely broken amount of potential profit is order of magnitude greater than the investment we will consider ganking fair if 20 t1 mining ships turns out 510 billion isk every 15 minutes consider those gank boat are worth 550 mil and the gankers already know how much of a loot they will have ganking is less risky than daytrading or mission runing that industrial gankers blew up is taking more risk at market fluctuation than the gankersas a profession ganking is the exploitation of highsec mechanics for easy money you cant get bubbled in highsec so instant undock always works there is no aoe in highsec so spam always works lets use an occams razor here do the same people who blow up empty freighters and random shuttle for tears want a better more enjoyable eve out of good of their heart or is it more likely they spin this nonsense so they can continue exploiting a broken profession without ccp ever balancing it 
this is a tired and frequently mythbusted claim blowing up internet spaceships in a game about blowing up internet spaceships is not bullying
im away at a conference irl but keep the questions coming in hope to catch up with them soon
okay so if you dont like doing any of those things i have to ask what are you doing and why do you think high sec is the best place for those thingsyes i ask for all high sec votes if you want high sec to be a lowimpact loweffort lowparanoia area than the very best thing you can do to achieve this is put cheese in all other security bands ergo buff income buff resources buff everything about other security sectors let actual content develop in other areas so people can meaningfully become outlaws so long as high sec has the absolute monopoly accessible income player base etc so too will it remain so turbulent i am as much for a better high sec as i am for a better new eden thera is good but needs some more accessible content seeds i feel as if the first day people were very good natured and sportsman like about jousting spaceships into each other but there needs to be a persistent source of conflict something pvp fit ships can do which rewards them but puts them at risk get people off the stations and holes get fights going in space
always good to have a merc representative
i fully endorse psianh is the guy who really helped me when i was first starting with eve and remains a good friend and mentor to this day
i support this idea
obviously posting with an alt given the controversy that this post will no doubt createi would hope the assembly hall will read this in full  consider the contents of the suggestions and arguments and recognise there is a fundamental flaw in the game war mechanics which impact on a significant number of the subscribersas a long term player of eve and running an successful pve and indy corporation i very much appreciate that wars are part of the fun of evefor the people that enjoy that element of the game however many of us enjoy the pve elements and our alliance is a collection of player that enjoy that side of the gamepaying for at least 100 accounts each month to do sothe current war mechanism has protected the smaller corporations from war decs and shifted that to the larger alliance where a small group of pvp griefer players can distrupt the gameplay of paying subscribers just to get easy killsforcing people to stop playing the game they enjoy or to use npc corporations to avoid the warsi would like to propose a plan to shift wars to become a meaningful objective based mechanic and not continue with the notion that wars are part of eve learn to pvp or hire mercs  the very same mercs that abuse the current systemi have started to lose faith in what the development team values in eve as the direction its going the sandbox seems to only favour people who want to destroy sandcastles not build themthere really doesnt appear to be anyone considering why do the small corporations form up and then disappear crime and punishment is littered with corporations asking how they defend themselves and their operations in high sec warsgranted its part of what makes eve online eve that if someone really want to spoil your day they canbut the current mechanics are far to open to abusethis actually harms the games development the smaller corporations never get off the ground new players who band together often have to join a larger alliance in the hope of some protection only to find that the same griefer corporations war dec the empire based alliance even more frequentlymy alliance has been subjected to this for many yearswe have operations and procedures we put in place to fight back we work with the other corporations and we avoid losses through intel etc however the fundamental way to actually end a war where the purpose is just to create targets for people to shoot at is to merely avoid the conflict and ship spinis that really how ccp views winning a war and for it to be meaningful game playi dont propose making high sec completely safe the beauty of eve is there is always a way to get something done the espionage fraud  theft and aggressiveness of the game makes it what it isthere has to be consequences team super friends put a significant amount of work into the bounty and security mechanicsthis should be the mechanism that deals with high sec conflictif a corporation has an issue with an individual the game mechanics should mean that they can assassinate the player but they have to choose their time and placehigh sec concord will deal swift justicebut are they quick enough to save the victim unless the victim is lured into a trap through legal game mechanicsif a corporation has an issue with another corporation then the fee for concord to turn a blind eye to conflict in high security space should be significant would the usa allow microsoft and intel to start a war within us territory that should be the view of concord  as is being used for another space mmothe cost should be enough to make the corporation consider all other optionsengage the pilots in low sec infiltrate the corporation undermine its trading options through market pvp conduct a propaganda campaign  hire genuine mercs to complete a job  again this would still cost a significant amount more than the current 50 million for a small corp and 500 for an alliance for the pocos in high sec any corporation that chose to claim a high sec poco would forgo the protection of concord  concord being the protector of high security space is stretched too thin to provide defence for structures within high security spacebut there is always a price this would help ccp with the desire to shift game play to low sec and null seclow sec used to be a case of here there be dragonsnavigating low sec used to be fraught with danger because thats where the pirates lived and getting to null sec was even more of a challenge as you had to survive the route through low sec 1stthis also made the pvpers actually pvp not just gank mining barges players would be anti pirate groups breaking gate camps players would need to escort assets if they didnt have access to jump freighters or carriers or use logistics corporations such as red frog i am not someone who needlessly complains about game issues  i have played since 2003  ran a successful player alliances for most of that time  the changes ccp has introduced over the years have kept the game fresh but i do worry that the new player experience the interests of your subscribers who just want to play the game how they want to following the pve and industrial careers that the game offershigh sec should never be safe but there should be significant consequences to any acts of aggression there and the game mechanics should enforce that not circumvent it
bro your formatting and sheer length of post is kind painful woudl be nice if you added a bulleted tldr at the end summing up the major points for debate that way we can go back and read in more detail that section to bring a response
things are being consideredthe csm are actively talking to ccp about how social grouping in eve can be taken forwards both in adjustments to the current system and more complete overhauls
the current industry and market mechanisms guarantee that i lose money to builders and traders forcing me to perform money making activities that i do not enjoy and disrupting my preferred style of gameplay ship on ship combatthe only recourse i have is well nothing i have to either build stuff myself make money or find someone willing to do either for me or i have no ships and equipment to blow up other players withall of eves systems and styles of play are integrated the conflict that arises from this is intentional because that is what makes for an interesting gamepvpers cannot blow up ships without performing industry or money making activities that they may not enjoy to support their gameplaypveers and industry types cannot make shipsequipment without performing shiponship combat that that they may not enjoy to support their gameplayits a twoway street neither side is entitled to be left alone or have mechanics discourage the other side from bothering themi read i do not like pvp make it so that it is not worthwhile to engage in pvp in highsec so i can be left to my own devicessorry but the only way that will happen is if i a pvper can get the stuff i needwant without having to give you much if any of my hardearned moneyoh wait that would not be in my interest because then my industrial operations would not make much money anymore and i would not be able to feed my habit of spaceship violenceit is actually in my interest to encourage more war and conflict because then people buy more stuff and i can sell for higher prices due to higher demand and more difficult logistics
i believe that if you have to go quoting partial sentences out of a post i made more than a month ago to back your point then you need to learn to present a better argument presenting arguments is of course the primary role of the csm the election of who is what this part of the forum is dedicated to anyway i consider this to be a likely troll candidacy and as such having dealt with the issue of a barelyincontext quote i shall retire from posting any more to it
sorry you feel that waya this is not a troll candidacy i really am this crazyi dont suffer from insanity  i enjoy every moment of it b i would like to point out that i i sent you a mail with a link so you would know that you had been quotedii have in the unedited post a link back to the original for the full thread and context so it is not partical it is brief can you imagine how long winded nonfiction would become if no one could use citations but had to quote the entirety of books and chapters
thanks for your reply jen i share your frustration with dscan as currently implemented but id rather see it improved and then taught to new players than add some odd new damageablation mechanicsi agree with this in principle insofar as logi is as silly as it is now because fleet alpha is silly tooi dont know how much would change in practice though have i told anyone about the time we engaged our 8 6 dps2 logi to someone elses 12 8 dps4 logi on a wh and my scout in the hostile hole watched as they warped in 8 more logi ready to jump in case we actually managed to bread the 4 they already had except for one run in nagas we werent flying alpha ships eitherso id say that risk aversion is already enough of a problem that nerfing logi along with a nerf to alpha wont change anything substantially
it was posted on the screens at fanfest when i first saw the statistic i will try and get a cite for you
if ankesemtapemkah liked to pvp the campaign thread would probably look like this tora just doesnt have to social skills to be an effective csm the petty back and forth on this thread is fairly typical of the interactions ive had with him both working with and against him we can do better
if you can do it anyone can at least my social skills are much better then yours this noir support might just have given me more votesthanks for the bump  3
bump because  yeah mike azariah
wait wait wait 510 billion every 15 minutes what im going to assume you mean million and even that is generous lets ignore ganker srp for a minute and look at margins on barge ganking for solo gankerscurrently a t2 fit catalyst costs around 8 million isk 15 million of that is the hull  rigs and cannot drop as blue loot gankers dont receive insurance so the average loss per gank in a t2 cat is around 445 million isk this assumes of course that no one interferes with your attempts to scoop your own loot for yellow loot a reasonably fit retriever might have 10m in modules on it im using pyfa numbers right now someone can double check my math with eve central if they want strip miners are around 3m a piece a meta 4 shield extender is similar dc2 and mlu2s are 300400 thousand a piece so 1011 mill isnt an unreasonable estimate i can ignore the rigs because again those cant drop so our average revenue per gank is about 555 million 55 in yellow loot  45 average loss  1 mill per 15 minutes or 4 mill an hour i dont think theres a lower paying profession in the game than that but it gets worseweve been calculating 1 gank per 15 minutes but this isnt realistic the criminal timer lasts 15 minutes that doesnt include time spent undocking warping to the target and ganking the target i also doesnt include all the time spent searching for a target because theres none around when criminal timer wears off if a ganker manages to consistently hit 3 ganks an hour they are doing very well so i think we can safely drop our estimate for the average income of a belt ganker that does not have srp down to 3 mill an hour but bebop you say what about all of those ore strip miners well my friend those are few and far between but this is a fair point the real profit in ganking comes from the abnormal fits the people who think yes i will spend half a bill to get 1 better yield still should the ganking profession be based around the careful miner who mitigates risk or should it be based around the person who is offering expensive modules up on a silver platter also how many hours might i have to gank to encounter this player i personally have never hit a barge with this sort of profit on the shipi guess now we should look at freighter ganking again i will run all numbers with t2 cats at 8m a piece but plese keep in mind that profit margins here are even more inconsistenta fleet of 20 t2 catalysts costs around 160m due to the cirus industry changes it used to be around 200m that fleet also has to be supported by at minimum one scout also doubling as the warpin one bumper one neutral agressor an orca pilot a freighter pilot and multiple neutral loot scoopers the fleet has 26 characters working together and can output approximately 326400 damage before concord arrives assuming they are in a prepulled 05 system i use a 24 second response time for this calculation instead of 26 because of dps loss for likelyhood of imperfect warpins also im calculating it at 680 dps with is perfect skills without implants due to the likelyhood of pod loss to white knights this is enough damage to gank anything except a triple bulkheaded providence or obelisk or some specific armor fits usually involving slave implants again we see a loss of 45 mill per catalyst multiplied across 20 ships to be about 90 mill total this of course again assumes that we somehow get all of the blue loot actually doing so is fairly rare on crowded gates but fairly common in deadspace i think we can safely say actual losses are closer to 110 or 120 million per gank calculating average yellow loot is much much harder freighters range wildly in amount carried but my experience would put an average somewhere around 500m in the cargohold 17 bill is a fairly normal amount for a freighter loss at 500m in hold 50 drops im ignoring courier contracts for this but they do put a strain on consistency giving us about 250m in loot subtracting the costs of the catalysts nets us 125m or so in profits distributed across 25 characters for a total of 5mpersongank at three ganks an hour were still only matching level 3 mission payouts finally this has assumed perfect yellow loot scooping and no failed ganks at any given time when we are freighter ganking well have 510 people trying to stop us weve been using eccm for a long time now and it is extremely effective but we are still contending with attempted smartbombers and burst ospreys 3 ospreys negate approximately 4 catalysts worth of dps with extremely low risk to them so we are constantly playing a numbers game currently we have the numbers to continue but how long can we hold thatfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
there is so much wrong with your assumptions and logic i almost didnt want to repsond to it 1 ganking is not safe it is in fact very unsafe compared to almost everything else you can do in highsec we are aware of this however and act accordingly minimizing what we put on the line in other words we dont act like idiots and then complain when acting like idiots loses us hundreds of millions or billions of isk in implants ships or cargo examples not blinging out your pod as at some point you will lose it due to being sloppy flying into a well placed trap dc connection latency2 shooting someone without a profit motive is not considered griefing by ccp at least not to the point where it would be considered harrassment and bannable the proof of this is in all the petitions filed against gankers without them being banned3 ganking in itself is not profitable unless you pick out your targets if you use t2 catalysts for ganking miners youre losing money even if you are able to recover your loot which is often not the case from ganking miners im breaking even at best 4 ganking is not less risky than daytrading or mission running in itself the risk of daytrading or mission running and ganking relies completely on what you are putting on the line and how much effort you put into it completely in the players own hand5 spam does not always work because of lag i once had my pod warping out already only to be rubberbanded back onto grid and going squish6 you complain that ganking for profit is not fair yet you also seem upset about ganking without a profit motive does not compute unless you simply want to remove nonconsensual pvp from highsec or the entire game perhaps completely or nerf it so far into the ground that ganking will completely ruin your char your entire account or even all of your owned accounts stuff like that has been advocated many times account wide sec status drop not being able to enter highsec anymore ever removing all docking rights etc etc etc
ive actually read through all of your responses and all i see is constant whining that code is doing every single daywah wah nerf the income of other parties wah wah we need more pilots to join pirate ranks wah wah nerf industrialistsim sure you understand that the content youre trying to promote heavily relies on the content youre trying to downtrod ever so heavilyif and when you actually fight for rebalancing of everything done in highsec including nonpirate activities industry legal business then we can talkuntil such a time comes youre just a wailing child who envies its neighbour another toy
what rebalancing are you referring to can you be more specific as to what you think needs to be fixed in highsec and what you would like a csm candidate to push for if elected
thats quite the imagination you have there
sabriz some time back ccp soundwave said hed like to see concord eventually replaced with player tools what do you think of this idea if you agree with it do you think the time is right to lobby ccp over it if you dont think its time why not
neither is throwing a ball at a kid while playing dodgeball but if a group of you repeatedly pelt the same small kid full pelt while hes obviously not enjoying it it kinda turns that wayall of these calculations and yet the reality still stands that ganking is highly profitable
thats why ccp has stated that if you go out of your way to make playing impossible for a single player in highsec it will at some point be considered harassment if the small kid in eve however decides to constantly undock in the same  fit barge in the same part of space and keeps getting blown up that is not considered harassment by ccp they will judge on a case by case basis though from my experience it is very rare that miners dont wise up to some extent after a gank or two would that be the reality that exists primarily in your own mind ganking in itself is simply not profitable it can be profitable if you pick your targets right but that requires more effort and time to find said targets which will really really hurt your iskhour ratio i only gank miners and everything else that happens to be within a few km if i get the chance and i can tell you that it does not make you a rich man im always happy if i can loot enough to cover my catalyst
the people directly responsible for that profit are those that insist on carrying way too much in ships that are far too weak as bebop pointed out suicide ganking isnt profitable against competent targets its the ignorant the lazy and the greedy that end up losing their ships and providing the big payouts
come now lucas you know that isnt a fair comparison gankers typically seek targets of opportunity  players who make a mistake and afk somewhere they shouldnt or overload or overfit a ship gankers dont sit in front of a station repeatedly podding some new player every time he undocks in a noobship as your allusion implies gank victims have at least 15 minutes to get away from the situation and learn from it and have plenty of tools to defend themselves from another gank in the future painting them as hapless victims without agency is disingenuous especially as we all voluntarily play a spaceship game with exploding spaceships at its very core ganking can be highly profitable like trading but usually isnt as bebop laid out in detail and just like trading ganking is completely dependent the decisions of other players  in fact if other players play 100 defensively there is zero profit in ganking it is this tradeoff of opening yourself to the risk of being ganked for some benefit increased yield less hauler trips autopiloting your pod etc that is a central design pillar of this game this forces player choice for fits and behaviour and makes the game much more interesting than the simple exercise in minmaxing yieldcargo that it would be in the absence of riski am sure you know all of this already lucas even if you would prefer eve to be a more solofriendly game but i am not so sure of that is true of several of the other posters in this thread
thank you for your earlier responsewhat is your position on fighter assignment for example a nyx assigns fighters from the edge of a pos to a t1 frigate which is somewhere else in the systemwith kind regards l0rd carlos
t3s and ishtars  i was having this discussion with some wormhole people the other day it feels like the tengu is the biggest violator currently if anything the loki might need slight tweeks ishtars i think reduce the drone bay to 200m3 they can carry 1 set sentries 1 medium 1 small set of drones the problem with nullsec pvp is bombers they are still completely  and coupled with how easy probing is now the godbomb run is a actual thing and threat at all times they severely restrict fleet concepts in nullsec when my opponent brings dominixs id love to bring alphafleet but doing so is suicide due to bombers yeah bcbs  hacs are way outside the meta especially in nullsec most times its just better to bring a t1 cruiser than a hac bcs are so woefully inept next to t3s command ships arent in much better shape and most bs are laughable at best in nullsec
the problem with lowsec is simple there is no meaningful reason to be there other than pvp it offers no unique features or advantages think about it with me what do the other areas have that are uniquehisec  safetynullsec  sov ownership  supercapital productionwormholes  sleepers  semiisolationismlowsec hmmm something should go here i mean i guess fw but thats basically sov war with training wheelswhat i would change islowsec should be the premier industrial area of eve it should have the best and most efficient factory lines available in eve players should be able to contract protection from factions basically put in a system where players can purchase standings to fw by purchasing a 30 day certificate from the faction of their choosing the isk then gets divided amongst fw members every month furthermore when factory lines are utilized it unlocks benefits for that faction so basically you end up with a system where lowsec is busy with builders and industrialist faction warfare members now have meaningful reasons to patrol and protect their factions space they have reason in which to raid opposing factions and reasons for conquest of opposing factions space because whoever is providing stable and safe areas will get more business furthermore with increased traffic and population it gives more reasons for piracy to exist i see lowsec as basically empire space and the factions are basically mafia families they extort money for protection services from people wanting to engage in industry in lowsec but the hook has to be that doing production is so much cheaper and efficient in lowsec versus hisec that it draws builders there
a few things fighter assignment is kinda dumb because the carriersupercarrier pilots drone skills are meaningless this needs to be addressed secondly its a very contentious subject as lone carriers and supercarriers are easy to kill with bumps so making them sit to far away from pos shields means instant death should someone land on grid and call in friends however it is frustrating to have a capital slink back into the shields whenever someone tries to stop them assigning fighters furthermore you see pilots using sticks to assign fighters from a stick is a online tower that has not had the forcefield turned on  the forcefield can be turned on instantly if the capitals are in any danger honestly i dont have the answer but i understand the problem from all sides and its permutations  if i had to stab in the dark i think capitals need to be somewhere between 50007500 meters minimum from the forcefield to assign fighters thats a stab in the dark though if ccp were actually willing to look at the issue id wanna talk more with the community to look for better ideas
they can also assign from the inside of the edge of a deadspace pocket only way to point them is to burn 15 minutes with a interceptorbut thanks for your answer looks like you know the mechanicsif i may i want to give you my personal opinion i guess you can read from my wording that i am not very fond of the current mechanics a nyx or thanatos on a medium  large pos with ecm and guns is very hard to remove at least for a smaller fleet while they only risk 3x frigs they have over 7000 dps that can hit interceptors the risk  reward scale is way out of balance on this one the drone module changes to fighters and the latest jump mechanic changes made them pop up more and more around lowseci would remove the fights assignment all together why is it there what benefit does eve have from thisit eve gets abused in pve i had an alt in a corp that rent space assign fighters from a gank  tracking nyx to a brick tanked carrier the carrier always had cap to jump had 7000 dps and a immense tank  scram  web 200 mil iskh farming machine in a cyno jammed system gf gfno need to response i just wanted to vent thanks again for your response changes are high you will be getting my vote
whenever youre fighting in catch you might be able to zoom in at a ship and see me leaning out a window shaking g my fist at you for the csm however youll be getting my vote1 my dear frenemy
updated the list of things to fix
thank you for your earlier responsewhat is your position on fighter assignment for example a nyx assigns fighters from the edge of a pos to a t1 frigate which is somewhere else in the systemwith kind regards l0rd carlos
it is no secret that assigned fighters are way to strong and they dont have any risk at all involved in using them you can set your carrier up at a offlined pos and just online it as soon as anyone drops you i have no idea why fighters even can warp or receives bonuses from ddas omnis and drone nav comps while the carrier is not even on grid two of my friends run stiletto  hyena with assigned fighters and the stuff you can kill when you have 4k extra dps provided from off grid is insane its like the old gilaworm drone damage exploit except not an exploit i know there are many things in eve that are not fair or fun for the hostile party but this really is one that needs to be looked at by ccp
i am fully endorsing psianh for csm i have had multiple dealings with him and have spoken to him in regards to his campaign and feel that he is exactly the kind of person we all need on the csm it is in the best interest of all players to have a diverse and experienced representative group and i feel that with the influx of so many new players into eve psianhs unique perspective will be an asset to ccp and to all players moving forwardplease join me in supporting him for csmrj
psianh would make a great addition to the csm full support buddyvote psianh
1 for psianh he has what it takes for csm 10 great guy
guys a one or two of my numerous votes will go on him
1 for that  i really like to give my support to him because he is an active friendly and professional player
1 always great to have fellow merc on csmburn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
good luck  no need for more reply i think someone has already put you back on your place
hi fistywhat is your position on fighter assignment for example a nyx assigns fighters from the edge of a pos to a t1 frigate which is somewhere else in the systemwith kind regards l0rd carlos
hi carlos thanks for the questioni do not view fighters assigned from offgrid as good gameplay why should a character be able to apply dps from the edge of a pos shield anywhere in system now that fighters are affected by drone damage speed and tracking mods this has been abused and its use will only increase i am of the opinion that fighters should now function similarly to normal drones this would force the carrier pilots to be on grid to unleash the damage of their drones if anyone is interested carlos filmed a video of a typical engagement for us with some nice commentary
is your campaign based on just small group roams and being a representative of camel you know that most of csm have to pay for themselves to go to iceland now
my campaign is based on the fact that i can represent all aspects of eve since i have participated in a large portion of what this game has to offer i can represent wormhole space since i have been a large part of thera and use wormholes daily both kspace and wspace i can represent 00 because i have lived in sov 00 and npc 00i can represent lowsec because i have participated in faction warfare and currently base my operations out of lowsec i can represent highsec because i have alts that use jita and run highsec incursions i can represent the small gang community as well as the large gang pvp community because i have participated in both paying for my own trip to iceland would be absolutely no problem for me i am doing this solely to help represent my fellow players
what do you think are the main issues wspace has at the moment
there have been many changes to many aspects of wspace in the last few monthssleepers now rep each otherrebalancing of blue loot in the lower class wormholesrebalancing of wspace effectsintroduction of thera and 101 other shattered systemsintroduction of more statics and random connectionsintroduction of tactical destroyerschanges to isboxer in januaryso in my opinion there needs to be more time for the meta to settle for a few months before you start drastically changing pve or pvp again so i will choose the easy low hanging fruit and reply with poses and corp roles which luckily ccp have said they will be focusing on in the next year
consequences that is truely something that is lacking in the eve universe so you did something bad and concord blew up your cheap fit cata no big deal so you did so many bad things you are free to shoot by any player but since you can only fly cheapfast ships around and go anywhere you want and do anything you want again no big dealconcord and faction navies make grandiose claims when a criminal or enemy comes into their space you will be terminated you will surely die you will not be tolerated different navies have different flavors but they all boil down to telling the offending pilot that they are not welcome and will be killedbut when have you ever seen them back those claims or even take a stand against those they want to kill and will not tolerate they sure dont escalate if a drake is just hanging out tanking whatever navy ships happen to be there to catch it and they dont really do anything about the 10 criminals flying around in t3 cruisers eitherback on your point about hisec wars in any sandbox you will have griefers and no matter what you do you will always be griefed by players whose sole desire is to ruin someone elses fun there will always be exploits and ways around the system in place to maximize their griefing potential the best way to defend against it is by having spread yourself out in gameplay styles available to you some of my characters are in their own alliance with a few dead corps and some cool people we have met along the way maybe half a dozen active players amongst 30 characters they get their usual grief decs like everyone else but they have ways around it passive income and activities are one alts in separate corps that are sufficiently skilled and can also do griefing of their own is another when one set is decd i play on the other more and vis versa diversify that was the word i was looking forthough i guess you were also directing it at the cost it has on new pilots which cannot do that or dont know how to prevent the extended decs or dont even know people they can recruit to help also doesnt help that there are so many fake war assistance corps out there which just lure the new corps into thinking they will get help when all they are doing is giving away isk maybe some sort of rating system for corps so that you would know if they will help or just want your isk but then that would be abused as well by the very same griefers nevermindregardless i have some ideas ive been writing up along the lines of real consequences in a game that says there are consequences for actions probably just as long a read as this one which is a shame because of the number of people that cant keep their attention for longer than half a paragraph 
removing industry from the equation basically kills renting which is a good thing
with the removal of clone grades and the cost to update your clone the one mildly usefull system bonus we got when upgrading a fw system with lp was lostcan we have a new bonus to replace it because at the minute after phoebe fw needs a bit of love
while ive been playing eve for a while i only recently joined the roleplaying crew i heard of arekjaalan read the ingame news looked up interesting characters etc i then found the intergalactic summit and the live events discussion forums intergalactic summit is fine if a bit stale as theres too much delay between each new interesting piece of information for us to discussthe real problem right now is the live events forum whenever we try to interact more with the lore we are supposed to discuss it there maybe get in contact with some special npc from a faction via evemail etc theres a sticky where were supposed to declare our loyalties another that lists npc contacts neither of them are kept up to dateamong the many threads in the first page only a few about 3 have dev replies within the year of 2014  none of the sticky threads have any contact from a dev in 2014 either ccp falcon seems to be the only dev who ever looked at the forum in the last two yearsreally if we want to shape the games universe as advertised we need more feedback on our actions more points of contact with the universe and this loreside contact is very interesting and powerful so please talk to ccp or even take it onto your hands if it is in the csms power to do so the rpers might not be leet pvp hardcore gamerz but they are as much a part of the playerbase as any others we want some love too this ton of wonderful lore that ccp has been dangling right in front of our noses is useless if we cant interact with it
apparently people prefer to just snipe the team auctions instead of bidding on them kinda defeats the purpose of having an auction system to begin withif you arent going to change it at least tell me how much i oversniped the team by i mean i get an email when i lose a team auction telling me how much the winning snipe was but nothing about how much i oversniped an auction byi think im done referring to this awful system as an auction system anymore cause all it has turned into 90 of the time is a game of chance for who snipes at the last second with the highest value i stopped even bidding on teams i was not going to be present at my keyboard for the end time because it is going to get sniped unless i snipe it insteaddarn shame really the system had such potential
i thought the absorb module was a rather good idea reducing alpha  all and logi repps at the same time
probably the best representative highsec industrialists have ever had in the history of the csm
would surely agitate against stealth nerf hisec to death candidate such as you sir
i find it difficult to take your proposed changes seriously considering the alliance you lead thrives on pushing the limits on some of the very issues youve brought upin fact it beckons the mind to consider whether or not your proposals are merely an elaborate charade the end game of which would be switching your official position to the exact opposite upon election
if you look at the last two replies you can see one telling me i will nerf eve to death and the other one who thinks i will do nothing as it doesnt suite my allianceeve is about content and balance if i think eve is getting to nerfed i will bring in more darkness if its to dark shine more light and to keep this in balance i talk and listen to people even to people i personally do not like making decisions as a csm should not be about feelings but factsi have made some strong statements here on this post not because that is the fixed direction but to get some good discussions going on and see how people think about things after reading the replies ill start correcting the direction we move in no yin without yang and vice versafor people who think i will turn highsec in to a nerfed wow disneyland no worries
the truth really being that youd only really push for changes which benefit you regardless of whether its balanced or good for the game whine endlessly about other changes which negatively affect you and explode into childlike rage when you are challenged im pretty sure most people know how you behave and really dont want to see the csm with someone like you on it i mean seriously look at your response to alekseyev at least my social skills are much better then yours this isnt a school playground where i know you are so what am i is a normal response also its than
eve is a great game where you can get daily tears from some predictable players this is something i will never nerf 
well at least youre qualified to commentthis thread definitely needs more high level industrialists
i vote for tora bushido
i will be voting for you mike
mikes done a fantastic job on the csm and not just for his constituency ill be putting him on my ballot for sure
i needed a candidate to give an example of absolute worst rock bottom lowest of the low the candidate who should he make it to csm would surely give people enough reasons to say that csm is a manure pityou guessed correctly i have found one a code member with evekilling intentions there can be no greater disgrace to any community than to have one speakinged oh dear i have found myself agreeing with lucas kell just how obvious an issue must be for the pinky and the brain to have the same opinion on it
ok back after the conference i was at all weekend i decided not to post anything substantive while at it and i wont catch up fully for a couple of daysi seem to have attracted a few detractors here as i understand it the unifying thing behind the detractors is that they dont like me because i promote ships getting blown up in every class of space that has resources of nontrivial value ie everywhere except for rookie systems i both personally blow ships up and encourage others to engage in asymmetric warfare in game calculating and exploiting the weaknesses of other playersalthough they vary on the details my detractors want to see areas of space with resources of relatively high value highsec incursions l4 soe missions mexallonrich belts ice anomalies in areas of space with minimal or no pvp and want to see changes that reduce the advantage the attacker has in surprise pvp at least in highsecive addressed why i think this is a bad idea earlier in this threadim intending to run an ask me anything session this weekend on the minerbumping teamspeak i invite detractors to come and ask hostile questions as well as inviting supporters to ask questions both sympathetic and curly and neutrals to ask whatever they want it will be recorded and posted to soundcloud  if youd prefer to ask questions anonymously im happy to facilitate that evemail your question to me from an untraceable alt and ill have a supporter read the question out
ripard teg has already come and gone
sabriz and i might not agree on all things but he does have the skills and passion for eve to be a good csm he spends a lot of serious time on his campaign and isnt one of those i want to be a csm because its good for my ego kinda guys
as expected from a failure of a candidate you couldnt have been further away from truthi promote more ships exploding in hisec more of your cheap ones you never worked for and less of the expensive ones people had to work for making you work for your ships and not just do zero risk ganking would be fine too
could you please expand on this how do you promote more ships exploding in highsec
devaluing the pve content isnt going to miraculously fix highsec issues you dont fix things by nerfbatting everything you personally disaagree with that you personally think in your own opinion is breaking the economyif anything itll promote more pvp pirating activities and therell be a point where it becomes degenerative and malnutricious to new and old players alike the hounds outnumber the foxesyou want less afk miners and botaspiring behaviour  make mining more interesting other than staring at your mining lasers cycle for hours and hours on end while your ore holds are getting fullim totally against a minigame that takes your mind off of your surroundings like hacking minigame which takes half of your screen away what id like more is the rebalancing of asteroids in a way that there would no longer be so many different types of rock but less where the most common materials would be on the outside and more valuable ones on the inside if you left your mining lasers alone they would be mining the outer layer which would require no guidance getting to the inner layer would require you to make corrections to the anglepenetrationwhatever of your lasers to get that valuable hemorphite ore out of a rock also introduce collision damage battleship bumping a frigate should result in the frigate being crippled or destroyed make collisions with space rocks on an equal scale you can shave off smaller rocks bigger ones will cause dmg with the introduction of manual control it would give a whole new level to being chased and taking them into an asteroid belt wing commander i style or staying in the middle of rocks to try and avoid falling prey to piratessize should matter a partisan with a slingshot should not be able to kill a tanker
i would not vote vote for you despite you trying to big yourself up as some sort of purist pvp playergo do some real pvp against ships that can fight backcode is weird role playing but whatever turns you on i guessjames aged 13 and a bit has an ego to rival that of mittens and you are associated with him in the gamecode offering to save hisec is like the fox offering to guard the chicken coop
ok i am still not clear on what you think needs to be rebalanced in highsec in fact most of your post is just arguing what you think shouldnt be changed as to mining i think everyone including sabriz although perhaps you can ask him about this at his ama on teamspeak would love to have a revamp making mining more engaging as well more rewarding to those that engage in team play and risk taking your last point though makes it clear you think bumping needs to be rebalanced your solution is unworkable though as gankers will just start ganking by ramming everything with massive ships with no concord response and if you make collisions spawn concord not only will the jita undock will be a continual field of wrecks how will you decide who should be concorded if it is the big ship or both ships then gankers will just sacrifice small worthless ships to get the loot from the concorded big ship or if it is the small ship gankers will just ram frigates all day in an agilityfit mach and let concord blow them up for them
i dont agree with you here but understand why you are saying this for most players its hard to separate evil eve role play with real life csm is real life stuff code is mainly role play i try to role play an evil annoying war lord and many will probably agree i succeed at it  but in real life i am totally different just like actors in evil movies arent evil people in real lifetry to find out if sabriz can separate the two before judging him
no its more like the stern responsible farmer offering to guard the chicken coop
if there are players on both sides it meets the definition of pvp and mining ships are certainly capable of packing tank dps and tackleroleplay sure  this is a roleplaying game after all weird not so much  weve claimed space as ours and we use force to keep it we hold sov without those pesky sov mechics that everyone so loves yay another multimillion hp structure to grind  only 3 more to do in this system chaps our sov claim can be invalidated by other people taking it from us by forceim sure you can do better than throwing around insults please try and be civilthats a terrible analogy though interesting in that you seem to associate a segment of highsec players with a bunch of chickens
sugars been a standout of csm9 ive seen her at work at eve vegas shes a natural definitely voting for her in a high position
you have proven your hard work ethic and clear communication time and time again sugar kyle
mynnna is leaving some big shoes to fill but endies got the chopsthe best part of electing the head of the goon intelligence agency is you never have to sit down and write him an eve mail to tell him about something he already knows hes known since you talked about it in corp chat now thats convenience
if you want to be absolutely sure he sees it just send yourself an eve mail
thanks for the support
i was sad to see manny be forced to withdraw last year happy to support him this year
greetings fellow capsuleersive been playing eve for approximately two and a half years since may 2012 my experiences are fairly diverse  i do everything ranging from 50100 person fleets helping contest sov 520 person small roamslocal defense wormholes teaching classes to newbies and running moon reaction farms however i feel that i am most qualified to speak about the challenges of being a small independent entity pvping in nullsec and about the struggles of newer playerssince august 2013 i have led one of the smallest and least veteranheavy alliances active in sov nullsec of sound mind we have lived in providence lived in wormholes lived in curse lived in syndicate and most recently have been a part of the hero coalition living in catch however my sovereignty and bloc isnt my identity  my identity is as a mentor to newbies and facilitator for their learning first and foremost regardless of who we fly with and where we live i have maintained an active killboard since the very first week ive played eve and always have a boots on the ground perspective as to things that are funworking well and things that are resulting in a stagnant gamemy perspective is unique because of my ongoing individual work with the new players we train every single day i see firsthand how players struggle with eves learning curve and how a little bit of individual guidance and mentoring can help transform them into confident empowered players excited about eve i want to make that scale and give every newbie joining eve the same opportunity to become excited about the game that i had and that i am only able to give a few dozen newbies at a time with the resources i have todaymy experience isnt merely the sum of my ingame activities i have the expertise to hold ccp accountable to realistic goals and to translate player demands into clear and reasonable requests to ccp i have previously worked in the mmorpg space as a software engineerantibottinganticheating czar working on puzzle pirates i have substantial project management skills as well as software engineering skills so i can easily determine whether something is realistically possible for ccp to implement or whether it would suck time away from more important development work for comparatively little gain i will be unapologetic about calling out vaporware bullshit promises without delivery and will hold ccps feet to the fire about making progress towards a healthier more stimulating gamein keeping with what i said about my experience i wont promise things as part of my campaign platform that i am unable to deliver i wont promise you rebalanced sov nowoneoneone but i will promise to make the perspective of the small pirate corpalliance that wants to plant their flag in null one day heard in the ongoing dialogue with ccp about evolving game mechanics i wont promise you redo all the tutorials but i will be insistent about pointing out to ccp the pain points felt by the new players i work with every day i wont be able to fix power projection with a snap of my fingers but i can speak to the ways in which i feel that current power projection mechanics helphinder fights today and speak up if i see instances in which malcaniss law that changes designed to help new players help experienced playersincumbents more may be coming into play furthermore i am always willing to openmindedly listen to perspectives that i initially disagree with and am comfortable advocating for the overall position of the community rather than only presenting my own viewssome of my past writing on sov mechanics coalitions and force projection may give you an idea of my views on things that are working and not working about eves mechanics todayhere are some overall principles that i will adhere to when speaking to ccp if i am elected eves challenge comes from making meaningful choices ishtars online and supers online do not make for interesting content everything should have a counter newbies are the future of eve if something would hurt incumbents but make it easier for newbies to get sucked into eve i will advocate it every time smaller objectives make for more interesting content over big bang once in a blue moon 10 tidi lagfests i look forward to answering any questions that the community may have for me ill collate my answers in a post below this one in order to make reading them at once easier
compendium of questions and tldr answersq what are your opinions on lowsec a i have individual reasons that i dont play much in lowsec but prefer not to force my opinions on people that do live in lowsec q why are you running a sov poses and alliancecorp management are very important issues to me that i want to see done right not in it for going to iceland  i intend to contribute remotely q what do you think about alts a alts are a symptom of mindnumbingly boring gameplay make the gameplay more interesting for mains to do or add deployables that eliminate the need for alts q what do you mean by forcing people to do things a give people incentives to engage with mechanics andor add consequences for ignoring mechanics q what do you think of ccp rises npe mechanics proposals a great to see ccp experimenting some further thoughts into the eve 102 of player interaction are needed but the steps towards improving 101 look promising q are you a bloc candidate are you ali arass successor a maybe and maybe in the event hero does organized voting this year i will likely only get a trickle after brave candidates similar to malcanis in past years i think similarly to ali but am not her clone q are you electable vs cfc candidates will you work for your coalition a csm voting is not zerosum and i am neither procfc nor anticfc i expect it will be difficult but that i can be elected i will work for the overall health of the game even if it hurts my coalition but my experience that i draw upon for discussions is primarily from flying with my coalition q why should people vote for you in one sentence what do you want to fix a im the only currently running candidate whose fulltime game job is teaching newbies i think matching players to good corps is the key to player retention and that the corp finder needs rework q how will you make pve suck less a i do not want to see 30 or 50 of ccps energy sucked away by levelcontent treadmilling increased vulnerability to other players and commensurate reward is the best thing to make pve more interesting and less monotonous q what do you think about smalllarge fleet meta balance a not necessarily broken  petes bombers cerbs useful for smaller gangs harassing larger gangs if nerf becomes necessary nerfing massed logi would be required to buff smaller groups harassing q how would you make smaller groups viable in lownull a lownpc null decrease value of carrier camping increase supply of staging systems sovnull remove incentives for people to have vast renting empires that take up spots on the totem pole that smaller groups should be contesting instead q what are your thoughts on wardecs corp cycling and awoxing a corp cycling for dec dodging can be fixed by giving everyone a very strong incentive to own a pos and making it so that poses cant be taken down during wardec spoolup if the corp disbands you at least get to make it cost them awoxing is complicated  weeding out bad corps is good but the mechanic also hurts corps that want to train newbies if wardecs can be fixed then that would be a viable mechanism for doing the weeding cap stable interview
the easiest way to reach me is by evemail or on tweetfleet slack if you have questions youd like to directly askmy recommendations for high ballot slots besides myself are in no particular order sugar kyle outstanding communication newbie education efforts dave korhal a smart genuine newbie jayne fillon who has done so much to ensure fleet pvp is accessible to newbies through npsi steve ronuken who does an amazing job advocating for thirdparty development upon which every single organized community in eve depends so much cagali cagali who works with an order of magnitude more newbies than i do by virtue of running the brave dojo psianh auvyander who speaks for the nonhighsec merc and small gang communities extremely well list may be amended as i see more of others platforms in order to feel confident issuing recommendations i do not accept or give crossendorsement deals  im telling it like it is without any kind of kickback backscratching stuffthere are other people not listed here that still would be good on the csm but dont need any help getting there
in your opinion1 what is currently broken about lowsec2 how would you fix it3 how do you see lowsec fitting into the universe as a whole going forwardthanks
having had some experience flying with june when sound lived in syndicate and now being reunited in catch with hero i give a big 1 for her bid for csmshes good people and we certainly need more good people fighting for us
honestly i feel like lowsec is not one of my core competencies i would prefer to avoid issuing major pronouncements about systematic issues in lowsec when i dont actually live there you also are not distinguishing between fw lowsec and nonfw lowsec which are two very different animals  which one are you interested in hearing aboutthat being said i can say that my personal annoyances with lowsec and security status mechanics are threefold1 alts make the concept of security status and militia status meaningless because you can get your own alts to take care of your market shopping etc for you there is no reason not to go full flashy because the consequences to it are mitigated with alts2 gate guns penalize frigatesized fights on lowsec gates unless youve deliberately opted into fw3 fleet boosting on a station undock is stupid broken and defeats the point of ccps changes to make pos boosting harder that ones easiest to bandaid fix by giving boosters weapon timers if they run their links but the long term fix revolves around ccps plans to bring boosters ongrid and at riskrambling a bit  i would love to see lowsec as a major thoroughfare that everyone has to pass through rather than being something that is easy to bypass many nullseccers and highseccers could care less about goingson in lowsec because it doesnt affect them and thats a problem people should be forced to interacti dont know how well ccps fixes to lowsec income via mordus spawns and clone soldier spawns have worked  anecdotally clone soldier spawns were helpful for brave member income when brave lived in barleguet but im not sure that problem is fully fixed having lowsec be a second class citizen for income potential because the income doesnt measure up to the riskfree income of highsec incursions the unlimited anoms of nullsec and wormhole cap escalations is definitely unhealthy for the game overallim pretty happy with the wormhole superhighway effect in lowsec that ccp added recently because it makes lowsec much more attractive to use as a travel pathwayin general though i really prefer to defer to the opinions of people that are lowsec experts when discussing lowsec balance i have my core competencies and dislike it when people that dont know what theyre talking about try to too many cooks me im not going to go trample over what sugar kyle has to say about lowsec she lives it i dont im happy to say what things would make me more likely to interact with lowsec in my day to day gameplay though if its helpful to discussions
why are you running why this year and not years before
believe me its not because of the free iceland trips full disclosure i am unable to physically travel to iceland due to being responsible for the care of an epileptic dog if elected i promise to attend every session remotely via videoconference i believe i can be as effective as someone attending in person  i have plenty of experience with being a constructive remote contributor from working with teams in other offices in my day jobgetting back to answering the actual questions  i have two reasons why this specific csm term is important to me this is going to be a pivotal year for eve and for the csm the increased tempo of changes coming from ccp demands a laser focus and early feedback so that ccp doesnt release something botched that it then has to backpedal or worse simply allows it to damage the game id much rather have a steady cadence of onpoint releases that take the game in a healthy direction with sov poses and alliancecorp management on the agenda for 2015 i feel that representing other players that are small independent fish is going to be important the heavyweights have their voices already  sion endie and mannie among others that are almost certainly going to be elected i can speak coherently and competently for the 50300 character sized groups one size does not fit all i felt that ali aras represented my opinions very well and saw no reasons that both of us should be in the running in previous years i helped her with her campaign planning and advised her to the extent that the nda would allow she is not standing for reelection this year and i feel that no other candidates represent my perspective as well as i could by representing directly
as an early supporter of alis im glad to see you running to take her place i have a few questionsalts make a fair number of intended mechanics in the game either meaningless or hobbled to the point of redundancy im thinking of bounties nevertheless ccp seems to have embraced them wholeheartedly i realize that this is a huge can of worms but since youre brandishing a can opener i have to ask do you have a specific approach on this not necessarily answers but an approach you want to take toward the issue since you clearly think its an issuecould you clarify this i get twitchy when i see the word forcelast question did you see ccp rises presentation on the intended direction for the new npe what do you think of it right way wrong way hard to tell would it dovetail with the way youve brought new players under your wing or interfere
great questions thanksthere is a huge amount of eve that is so mindnumbingly boring that no player is willing to do it as a career or requires so much trust that youd rarely delegate it to another player cyno alts or eyes alts definitely spring to mind for that multiboxing also is a huge problem  if your brain is so unengaged by what youre doing that you have plenty of attention span to spend it on three other accounts at the same time then maybe the mechanics should be changed to be less afk or click a button every 10 minutes there should be a reason to get another human being to do something for you instead of doing it yourself on an alt i think that deployables present a good solution to cases in which you really cant make it more interesting such that a player would be interested in and valued for doing itfeel free to treat forced to engage with x as there should be meaningful consequences for ignoring x and meaningful benefits to becoming more engaged with x i honestly cannot say i am happy about the fact that except for the fact that i need to light a few logistical cynos in lowsec theres not much of a game mechanical reason for me to care as a person living in nullsec about what happens in lowsec there should be more incentives for me to want to do things in lowsec even if i dont live in lowsec right now my alliance pretty much ignores the existence of lowsec since theres no benefit to us from engaging more and no penalty to us for how little we engage in lowsec activitylet us imagine for instance that the spawn rates of outbound wormholes from nulllow increased dramatically and the spawn rates of nullhigh wormholes trickled down to 0 that gives me a very very very powerful incentive in combination with say a jf range nerf to start doing more logistics through wormholes through lowsec if i live deep in null and to start escorting industrials through low or roaming low more often instead of just waiting for the next wormhole to highsecunfortunately i wasnt available at the time that that was scheduled on the vegas stream and i didnt realize that the videos were helpfully being archived and published to youtube after the fact   ill watch it in the next day and get back to you
ive gotten to know june pretty well over the past year and a half i think shed do a pretty solid job as a csm rep
xanders a stand up guy and an excellent blevel podcaster hes worth your support to send him back for another successful year
continuing the tradition of strong goon candidates he doesnt need my vote but ill put him on my ballot anyway xd
i fixed that for you
1 for psi and good luck mate
nariya kentaya i am not really a fan of the tldr if theres a case and argument for change then detail is essential especially in the assembly hallsteve ronuken great to see the csm are in discussions with ccp and vice versa  it would be interesting to see the proposal having read the summer summit minutes there seemed to be very little on the subjectthis post was in response to gms suggestions that any change would only come about via this forum and discussion with the csm i would be more than happy to discuss this further with you using my mainshahfluffers i personally do like pvp and i do believe no one should ever be protected from the risk of losing assets your comment  i do not like pvp make it so that it is not worthwhile to engage in pvp in highsec so i can be left to my own devices pretty much sums it up players live in high sec for the perceived securitythe current system means anyone can pay concord to turn a blind eyemaking high sec effectively null sec without bubblescapsi appreciate the game mechanics are linked supply via industry and demand from conflict i dont propose any change if you someone wants to pvp they can still gank miners mission runners or pay to war dec a corporation or alliance the issue is griefer corporations that merely war dec half a dozen newly formed small corporations or industrial corporations just so that they can await a victim at a trade hubis that meaningful game play theres no risk for the griefer corp and the new players or industrialists have no option other than to ship spin play alts or relocate for a weekuntil the war is declared void and then another griefer corp picks up the mantledangeresque too indeed there are too few consequences i do believe that concord is the correct mechanism to deal with high sec criminal acts they maybe need for tools to serve justice on offenders i dont think concord should ever prevent the crime though so people still have a choiceagain its a sandbox and the inventiveness of people makes eve what it isfrom back when moo was around and there exploits to goons and burn jita but for me the current war mechanism is far too open to abusethe options to play during a war are varied my alliance uses all of them even if the war mechanics are changed if someone pays the price to declare war then my members still would have the same optionall i am proposing is make the act of declaring war mean somethingnot just be a means to create targets of opportunity
which is bad because it is not nor ever was meant to be truehighsec was meant to be relatively safer compared to lowsec which is relatively safer than nullsec which is relatively safer than wormhole spaceplus balancing the game based on perception alone is a very dangerous thingno not like nullsec not even lowsec eitherin either of those two areas everyone is out to kill you not just the people who you are your sworn enemies this means you cant fly casual in any way shape or form without also being very smart andor well preparedif you have been living in low or nullsec for any stretch of time highsec wars are trivially easy to deal withto each their owni get off roaming around lowsec aimlessly shouting dakka dakka in local then blowing people up that is meaningful gameplay to meif someone feels their time is will spent camping a poor sob in a station who am i to judgethough from the victims perspective either in my scenario or the station camping one our forms of gameplay probably wont have any meaning in any way shape or form and it certainly wont be fun if they just sit therebut that isnt exactly a systemic issue thats a player issue the victims can have fun they just have to make it fun by either turning the tables or changing their perception altogether both of which are difficult but possibleedit as far as risk to the war deccing corp goes players are supposed to provide that risk if you have nothing to dissuade someone from attacking you then you are making yourself an easy target understand that the act of attacking people even helpless people is not greifing in eve even if it is for lolsthis means that highsec war deccing corporations are not griefersgreifing is when you single out and harass an individual over a substantial course of time despite the efforts of said individual to avoid itthis is laid out pretty clearly in the eulaone last thing in eve a player is only as helpless as they make themselves if you are an industrial corporation with no ability or will to fight back against aggressors you should not be surprised by the resultand yes everyone should learn the basics of pvp even if they do not like it because pvpers have to learn the basics of nonpvp activities to survive tooagain its a two way streetwar means whatever people want it to mean you cant forcibly make it worthwhile when it is subjective in their first place not without turning it into a grindfest akin to 00 which you do not want trust meive once declared war on a corp where one of its members looked at me funny rationally there was no meaning to it for me though it was perfectly justified and i proceeded to make the war as fun for me as possiblethe other guys though half of them left the corp right away half of the other half stayed in station cowering and the few remaining scrubs tried to take me onthey died of course but after a few chats i decided i liked a few of them so i poached them for my corp i dont really see a problem with any of the above i went through it when i was a newbie yeah it was painful yeah it made me mad yeah many of my newbie peers were confused though i could not understand that one as the term war is pretty self explanatory people get to shoot you but because i asked both my corp leaders and the guys who shot me i learned what to do and how to survive betteri expect nothing less from a newbie let alone a semiestablished player with set moneymaking activities
as a former highsec pveindustrial subscriber i can honestly say that op is full of it oh no someone wardecd my highsec carebear corp whatever will i dowell i guess im off to go run lvl 3s in a t2 fit cruiser for a week or two rather than lvl 4s in a blinged out battleship remember most highsec wardec corps are after easy kills with decent payouts moving 1520 jumps away from where you were based and switching to a ship that costs less than 30mil will generally take you off the wardecers radar since its just too much work to track you down for that puny of a kill not saying all highsec war corps are like that but almost all of the ones ive encountered have been
so how many ratting ishtarsbattleshipscarriers should be stuffable into one systemand is blob based sov really better than having military objectives with timers so you cant hold objectives even with your blob but you want to be able to take sov anyway
interesting idea on the orca and rorqual makes sense especially with the jump fatigue and range reductionsdemocracy is currently a farce in most of the west we have no hopers in positions of power who hate their own people the only place in europe that has a functioning democracy at this point is switzerland and that is because they have a binding system of referendums that gives the people some power to rein in their political class and wow the people have actually been sensiblethe vote for none of these is rather large in real life and in eve so again an interesting idea i dont vote in teh csm because doing so would give it legitimacy even though i do feel at times they ahve done some good things but many have a viewpoint i do not agree with so your suggestion would enable me to votei like your comments in the mining hate thread the key point is that there needs to be a buff to consequences for suicide ganking i have suggested 10 to remove docking rights but there may be others that workwell so far you have my support blocked teckos pech sonya corvinus baltec1 shae tadaruwa wander prian daichi yamato jonah gravenstein merin ryskin linus gorp
i agree entirely with sabriz and am very disappointed in the positions tora bushido has taken here
as i said before my direction has not yet been set in stone i am using them to see how people think about eve i am not here to make eve as i would like it to see it i am here to make it as the community wants it to be so tell me how would you like eve to be
to use a roleplaying analogy ingame im chaotic evilirl im chaotic goodhowever when the consequences of chaotic evil behaviour are limited to space pixels ie outside rl chaotic evil characters make for a much more interesting world
what would eve do without folks like code and marmites make isk in highsec so they can pvp
no monocle no vote
id fit into neutral evil im mostly lawful evil while occasionally acting against the rules when i see fit irl im probably neutral good
when you chose representatives you dont necessarily need one with hisher own vision that happens to mostly match yours someone who actively gathers information concerns ideas and presents them to people who have final say on the matter would work as well if not betteri was trying to figure how my ballot will look and honestly i had other candidates in mind for priority position but if securing a place for kyle means that primary function of csm  being a voice of playerbase in ccps ears  is carried out then this is where my voice goesi admit i wasnt around this year and so i missed most of ops work as csm representative but from my past and present experience if you cant contact her you arent trying having someone like that on csm has an advantage you will be able to relay concerns of your group of players even if those didnt arise and got formalized prior to election regardless of where you live and what you doprops to kyle for her style because that sounds to me like csm on hard mode
you have my vote
are you running in place of ali arasare you the official candidate from hero
i am a close friend of ali aras i am running this year in particular in part because she chose not to stand for reelection  in previous years i would not have wished to split her support base and also felt that she represented my interests well i leave it to her to announce her csm x endorsements upon her own schedulei made my decision to run without regard to whether i was getting support from my blues i intend to pursue support from all parties  blue neutral and red my belief is that i will need every vote i can get in order to be elected  if brave announces any official candidates again i do not control the schedule upon which any such announcements might take place they will very likely come well before me on any ballot that brave or hero would produce my situation is similar to malcaniss from past years
my answers to foos questions which should appear at
pve in eve kinda sucks from the lowest levels up to incursions and stuff like that would that be part of your focus

angrodcurrently brushing up on my praise bob episodes and really enjoying the podcast im looking forward to hearing your interviews and following your campaign im glad we have a couple wormhole players running currently keep trucking along and i hope that your campaign goes well best of luck
im very interested in your platform especially anything that will make wspace accessible to new players youve mentioned a few things about roles i completely agree that the system is in need of improvements but are you committed to keeping corp theft viable as a profession i know its a bit off your platform but what is your opinion on the discussion of removing intracorp agression in high secfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
i feel that intra corp combat or aggression is more than viable and will remain so i do not feel that adding ease of use or logical changes to the current role system should be postponed in regards to no changing current intracorp aggression tactics awoxing will always exist corp theft will always exist i would simply prefer the ability to actually control my role system logically rather than with the limited options they currently providein wormhole space specifically intracorp aggression is a very real and dangerous thing to ceos and new corps it destroys dreams and turns more people away from this game then should be there are game mechanics flaws that pander to making corp theft amazingly easy where as safety becomes increasingly expensive and logistically insane i think with the resolution of these game mechanics issues we will have a decrease in small time corp thefts and an increase in much larger schemes and thefts mainly due to lower totem pilots who think they can just enter and take  their first week or so will die off rapidly but as directors and corporate espionage professionals realize that the corp is increasing in wealth instead of having it taken over and over again they will be more and more tempted to disappear into the night with more valuable loots and iskcheck out my podcast my blog
thank you for your vote of confidencecheck out my podcast my blog
which is exactly what the problem is with the current wardec mechanics the aggressor is able to throw a wad of money at concord to get virtually unlimited targets for a relatively small price there are corps out there that are constantly at war with over 60 different corporations at once the fact that such a thing is even worth considering is proof that the current wardec mechanic is one big jokefrom a gameplay perspective a mechanic needs to be favorable to both parties it needs a balance of risk and reward which is what eve is all about where is the risk vs reward balance in the current war mechanics the aggressor wardecs because they want kills they are prepared to fight fighting is the entire purpose of the wardec so there is virtually no risk involved for them while at the same time they reap all the rewards killmails loot payment satisfactionwhile as the defender its the other way around the average corp getting wardecced isnt exactly excited to have a war they have to stop whatever theyre doing and adjust to the situation someone else forces onto them your example of a proper reaction to a wardec by flying a different ship and moving to a different system is completely insane and further shows how broken the system is that should not be the proper response in any situation lets not forget that this is a game people play for fun yeah furthermore the defender corp bears 100 of the risk and absolutely none of the reward and consider just for a moment that there are people who dont consider killmails and pvp kills rewardingto put things in perspective imagine this situation was the other way around imagine there was a way for industrial corps to declare forced labor onto any random pvp corp for one week straight they would have to do mining and industry even though they hate every single second of it of course they could keep doing what they were doing but it wouldnt be very effective very risky and could potentially lose them billions if they didnt move far enough away from their mining overlords to stay off the radarso to recap aggressor 0 risk 100 reward defender 100 risk 0 reward that sht is broken and needs to be fixedand no high sec should not be a safe haven war decs should always exist in some form but in their current form theyre just hilariously broken in favor of the attacker at the very least this needs to become a 5050 balance but realistically the defender needs to have an advantage wardeccing someone should be an important decision that requires careful consideration not something you do in freaking bulk with 60 different enemies at a time just so you have something easy to shoot that wont shoot backsaying the current system is 100 not broken is nothing short of complete ignorance
war deccers are not some superhuman players with access to stuff that no one else has everyone in the game can use the same stuff is subject to the same mechanics and can use all the same tactics whatever their form may berisk comes from players be they aggressors or defenders if you dont provide the risk you are making the situation favorable to themits really that black and whitehow is adapting to a situation to better control the conditions you are in insanethats common sensenow this does not mean you have to stop whatever you are doing you can continue as you were but now you have to take precautions and accept that there is a higher level of riskyour comment here says to me that you do not want be forced into any situation you do not like tough that is one of the core principles of eve people can affect you in any way they like for better or worse its your job to work around that or push backso provide the riskjeeze you are only as defenseless as you make yourself and the aggressors actions are only as risk free as you allow them to beuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhwe pvpers already do this to a certain degree ships weapons equipment and ammo dont just come out of the sky well technically they do we do need to have an income to pay for our stuffso in a way we are already being forced to learn at least the basics of of the harvesting market industry and tradeand a lot of us hate every minute of iti fail to see why peaceful people should not learn the basics of warfarethis is probably the only thing i will partially agree with you on
1 yeah those corps that have 60 wars going at a time are almost exclusively merc corps who get their wardec bills paid by the clientele changing the price of wardecs will not effect this in the slightest2 favorable to both sides you need to share whatever youre smoking that makes you think this is even possible if one side of a fight has favorable conditions then the other side by default has unfavorable conditions in eve if youre in a fair fight both you and the other guy screwed up3 so its utterly insane to expect you to fly smart its utterly insane to not give the wardecers free kills while still keeping an income stream i think you also forgot that this is game people play for fun and some people consider it fun to blow up the spaceships of people like you defender corps only face the risk when they dont fly smart undocking in lvl 4 mission hubs in blinged out battleships while at war is not flying smart afk mining at any time is not flying smart wars are zero risk to a defender who flies smart4 if an industrial corp had the firepower to enforce a rule like that id say great of course the pvpers who fly smart will have backup options far away from those industrialistsrecap aggressor risk based on ability of defender to actually fight back reward based on ability of defender to fly smart smart defender couldnt care less about the war as it doesnt really effect him not smart defender cries on forums that wardecs are broken and need to be nerfed because he cannot fly smart bottom line if you fly smart you can ignore almost every wardec
i love how people are arguing that it is essential that eve has risk but they than ignore the fact that awoxing comes with no risk what so ever
confirming that theres no way an awoxer could ever end up on the wrong side of a killmail
i dont think its a bad idea in and of itself im just wondering why you prefer it to better leveraging the tools that are already in the gameive also wondered about ablative effects specifically as a way to allow activetanked ships to be viable in fleets
ok so my last question went nowhere lets try this onewhat do you think of the direction that ccp rise and his team are investigating for the allnew npe what can the csm do to support their effort
i have encouraged ccp to look at other games and perhaps do some major shifting of how the npe is approached sugar and myself and others are 100 behind improvements both in interest of having better player retention and just making the game learning curve a bit less of a cliff this is partially why i started operation magic school bus i am trying to get new players ready for fleets and lownull trips we need more of this sort of thing some encouragement for players to once again step up and be the content this means the biggest thing we need to drum into new players is communication skills how to read research use comms and mail and mailing lists look the current npe trains the players to mine to shift a bit of freight to run missions is that how you describe eve to people in real life the disconnect needs to be addressedill toss it back to you though which game has the best npetutorial in you opinion for me it is portalmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
do you happen to have a link to something about operation magic school bus
yes it isok no not really but you dont have to convince me that the current npe is absolutely terribleim not much of a gamer and eve strikes me as different enough that im not sure how much eve can learn i mean sure teso has a decent tutorial including the fact that you can skip the little baby part if youre rolling an alt but what you have to learn for a mostly themepark game vs the urgent problem in eve which is giving new players the ability to reach other people and plug into whatever the meta isthe basic controls in the game part is easy although the current tutorial manages to do even that wrong
i to will be voting for you again mike you are by far one of the most publicly active members of the csm next to xanderquestion timei know some and maybe all of this may fall under the nda so dont feel bad if you have to give general answersive heard the guys on the podside podcast mention this to you several times but i absolutely love the idea of station services in npc null to be attackable this happens to us in sov null from time to time and if i recall correctly you your self mentioned  i cant recall your exact words that you saw npc null as a way to get used to the mechanics of sov null and the tactics used there as it stands now npc dwellers dont have to deal with the defensive side of sov warfare now im not saying we should be able to flip stations just incapacitate there station services the same way its done to us with the difference being the npc station services will eventually repair them selves just at a slow rate or they can form a rep op the fix there services faster what is your though on something like thisagentswhy cant we have some in sov null there everywhere else but sov null and w space why cant we have some sort of station upgrade for agents it would be very helpful for the newer players that move straight to null to have access to mission agents another station question the different station upgrades that can be installed and as far as i know can not be removed unlike ihubs ihubs can have the different upgrades removed they are just destroyed like ship rigs i think the station upgrades should be able to be fully customizable not a one time dealim fairly sure this is in the pipe line but ill ask it anyway the current balance or unbalance as it is of the low end ores in null sec is an issue if ccp wants sov null to be eventually be self sufficient as is my tin foil hatery from phoebe with the introduction of space aids the minerals need to be rebalanced im just curious as to how you stand on this as a high sec indy guy since right now we still myself included do the majority of our shopping in jita 44 let me know your thoughts and ideasalso where do we sign to get you a permanent seat on the csm
i agree with most of that analysis except thisthe average is meaningless when there are 10100 fold variationsyou only need a 10 bil gank and you are set for the week and a 50 bil gank buys a plex for everyone involved so why do you even consider the average case  are you saying there isnt even one of these per month  you also did not address the risk factor ship scanners allow you to make exact caculation of how much it cost to gank a ship and within good margin how much it will drop you can see the antigank fleet in local either the ag fleet is big enough to stop the gank which only cost potential profit not inuring a loss or the ag fleet is not big enough to stop the gank and can only incur a cost increase but not a loss what actual risk is there to ganking 
only a 50bil gank well those occur practically every day
you seem really hung up on how much an activity can make are you equally concerned that one can make billions of iskday market tradingzkillboard seems a little wonky but you can see here how many 50b isk ganks there actually are
that you will lose your ship it being a certainty doesnt stop it being a risk that the loot fairy will stick two fingers up at you that you get a great loot drop but someone else nicks it that the gank will fail those are just off the top of my head im sure there are a few more
risk it doesnt mean what you think it meansrisk is the uncertainty about a net loss there is no risk if you know your ship loss will be covered by the the loot droppedsince there is cargo scanner and you know approximately half the stuff will get dropped your can gank only targets that carries many times more than the ships are worth not hard considering the ships are about 100mil for 20 and freighters tend to carry a billion or more iosses are extremely unlikely without ag interventionnow if freighters are immune to cargo and ship scanners youd be right
you are trying to establish that ganking is risk free
a gank ship is ammunition albeit more expensive ammunition than most a careful ganker can mitigate their risk to just losing their ammunition without losing their pod and can attack only targets that will probably offer a profityou know who else does this mission runners they select missions that look profitable skip ones that dont suit them and use ammunition including drones but manage to mitigate risk to a point where losing more than ammunition is exceedingly rarei know that because i used to be one and actually i run missions more than anyone might suspect as i always seek to keep my security status high
what do you think of the direction that ccp rise and his team are investigating in order to overhaul the npe what could the csm do to help
let me first describe my experience with pve then describe how it informs my viewpointsmy personal primary income source is alliance srp which is primarily funded by hunting and killing hostile ratters my secondary income sources are selling plex and running combat signatures i do not personally do any ratting in anoms i do try to help the newbies in my alliance establish their own income streams commensurate with their interests and see secondhand many of the struggles that they have with finding profitable and useful pve to do in nullsec i spent a week grinding l3 missions in highsec in order to run quafe l4 missions in syndicate as my income source when my alliance deployed therein the interest of being transparent and not doubletalky catering to everyone if you make your money through highsec incursions i want to nerf your income stream because its bad for game balance its highly repetitive gameplay that requires little attention and is nearly riskfree unless youre being stupid it is a hugely unbalancing force that causes people to have incursion alts running on a second screen that they make their real money with grinding in order to fund their other activities rather than being vulnerable targets in space for me to huntharass ive done incursions a few times to see what the fuss was all about and left very unimpressed ive been happy with lowsec incursions because of the potential to interact  to outright kill fleets running them and have a brawl rather than just plink away at the same thing for hours and endoverall my highlevel goals are to push ccp to get people into space and interacting with each other with reward commensurate to risk and balanced across all classes of space however similar to how i answered the lowsec question if your question is specifically about the ins and outs of l4 missioning in highsec i am not going to be the best person to address that need having a balanced csm of people from all areas of the game is importantspecifically addressing your question about the pve being boring  more randomness in spawns would certainly help to some degree of not making every anom exactly the same but lets be realistic ccp currently does not have the tooling or personnel to handle both doing ambitious other projects and also getting into the content mill grind of an absolute shitton of level design look at wow look at how little time order of a month or two it takes for players to finish grinding what takes multiple developeryears of effort to create eves content is other players first and foremost and developer effort to encourage player interaction scales into far more distinct possibilities for player enjoyment rather than ccp focusing on simply making the riskfree content less dull take the riskfreeness out of things and you will tend towards a much more compelling universe without having ccp permanently stepping onto the level design treadmillobviously fw button orbiting mechanics are a counterexample to my point about adding risk solving problems  there still has to be something to keep you occupied while youre waiting for a fight other than just sitting there but to some degree i think thats already the case with anom ratting at least  triggers to think about managing dronesgunsetc unless youre doing afktar ratting but thats a whole other bucket of wormsthis post has gone on long enough and im sure itll spawn a new wave of questions so rather than try to preempt what people are going to ask ill take followups

perfectly sums up the purpose of a request for changethe response that those 60 corporations are as a result of mercenary contracts is pure fictionthe majority have been declared to give the mercs something to do while waiting for a genuine contract if we want to start ripping the eula for support for any argument you may not do anything that interferes with the ability of other eve online subscribers to enjoy the game or web site in accordance with its rules this includes but is not limited to making inappropriate use of any public channels within the game andor intentionally creating excessive latency lag by dumping cargo containers corpses or other items in the game worldby utilising the current war declaration scheme a number of my members are unable to enjoy the game for a significant amount of the year yes they could leave the corporation some do and then come back they are still not enjoying the game as theyre in an npc corp not the one they want to be inagaintheres a need for war mechanics  pvpers need a means to permit then to shoot people in the facethere needs to be consequences on both sides ie you get war decd then respond as you see fitmove dock upfight the issue is the ability to spam war decs to cast a wide net means most small corporations and alliances are permanently at war with no consequences for the aggressor other than a token isk fee high sec should never be safe as shahfluffers stated highsec was meant to be relatively safer compared to lowsec which is relatively safer than nullsec which is relatively safer than wormhole spacewhen your at war 90 of the time based in high sec then that relationship with security status doesnt mean anything
if there wasnt this stupid rule in place where x spots on the csm are actually prereserved and are held by the same entities who are all basically their own team we could have 2 sides from each of the categories wed want represented high low null wspace other areas
find more csm candidates feedback on the warpto zero forums i will use this post to link my answers there what is your reason for wanting to get electedoccupancy based sovereignty and nrdschange one thing about nullsec sovrecon buffs and doctrinesfixing the blob effect

okay this one first it is a cool idea but the sov free areas are used by a lot of sov folks because of the safety a place where you can put your stuff that will still be there tomorrow you know that the null entities would enjoy making life hell for their less committed brethren in npc stations so is there a balance maybe not kill the services but hinder them or make them scale up in expense a price of battle and failure to consider where you are your homemoon mining why cant we have that in highsec some things are the difference between one space and another there are supposed to be differences between parts of space to give us a reason to make choices and not all of the choices should point to null being the end game where everything evrybody else has can be found there as well i know some folks think each part of space should be self sufficient unto itself i am sure if i looked hard enough i could find someone demanding that sleeper loot become atainable without all the hassle of wormhole lifeout of curiosity though are all the belts in null mined out is it that you lack the minerals or people willing to mine themmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
ii will not vote for you you represent everything i hate under a pretext of roleplay your gang of ganker code try to apply mafia techniques to take the property of others players in highsec and often are young players with not a lot of isk in addition you code try to implanting to all the players in highsec the mafia pizzoi hope that ccp will adjust the highsec security to make this place more safer for new player because ccp lose a lot of subscription to the game because your cowards technic discourage new playersremember animal and humans learn through play its important to learn good human values and its not what you do you are about to rot this game with your so called code roleplaying ganking its just a mafia technic for looseryour code exceed the limit and it is not fun for the player to be harassed every day
everything we do is within the rules and is as much part of the game as mission running or atk mining a safer high sec wont do anything for new players btw itll just mean more of them will have officerfit pimpmobiles before they finally get blown up
new players are completely safe from hostile player interactions in the rookie systems and i would never encourage ccp to change this fact in fact im in favor of ccp increasing protection from player interaction in those systems by disallowing the use of strip miners so that rookies can always find asteroids for their mining tutorialsits the notsonew players that grind out extreme wealth in near total safety in the rest of highsec by doing things rookies cannot do  strip mine asteroids in orca fleets blitz l4 missions and multibox incursions  that make code necessary
by that definition there is zero risk in mining or missioning as every cost is known for mining i think just t2 mining crystals and every mission and the triggers are available on community website removing all surprises certainly you are not arguing that ganking is somehow less risky than mining or mission runningbut again you misperceive the role of the risk here it is there to provide incentive for players to balance the yieldcargo of their ship with protection when fitting a ship ganking is not there necessarily as a minigame inandof itself plenty of tools exist to make yourself 99999 immune from gankers certain ships modules behaviours  they just all require a direct tradeoff against yield or some additional effort that is just how the game is designed making freighters immune to scanning is a poor choice as it would diminish the purpose of ganking in the game  to provide risk to players overloading and overfitting their ships if pirates could not look inside they would have to just destroy ships blindly and there would be no incentive for the haulers to carry less as the risk of loss would be the same no matter what they carriedbesides what you suggest is already in the game  blockade runners are immune to cargo scans if you have something valuable to transport you want to remain unscanned you can use one of them if you want to inject uncertainty into ganking i would suggest looking at varying the predictable concord mechanics or through new modules that can provide false information to gankers
you do know that each csm x candidates thread is for people to ask them questions and have the candidate answer righti didnt in any way want his or her internet space lawyer to go answering questions so either youre yourself a candidate for csm x which invalidates sabrizs candidacy due to incompetency or youve overstepped your boundaries please decide which and let us know
im fine with other people answering questions directed at me if i strongly disagree with them or even if i agree but want to raise a particular nuance ill do somy opinions on what would be good for eve are heavily influenced but not determined by james 315 psychotic monk and several other people others with the same influences will often not always have similar opinions to methis thread is a conversation as well as a qaalso sylphy  not sure if you saw it but im running a qa at 2300 eve time saturday of this week on the minerbumping teamspeak hostile questions are welcome and if you arent willing to be recorded you are more than welcome to ask them anonymously
hey sabrizfirst i would like to wish you good luck with your candidancy if i may ask you a serious question which if possible i would like to be considered in the outside of game manneri consider the current content of code in high sec and the effect it is creating in particular the anti gank group to be some of the best player driven content i have ever experienced whether this is intended or a side effect i am not sure i only have one serious concern and would appreciate your viewdue to the nature of the miner gank it naturally targets young players trying to make the initial start up isk which could then project them into more costly gameplay pvp or pve are you not concerned that we as a community of eve players could lose newer guys due to this during that initial period of joining its hard to make reasonable isk and as we all know survival is skill point dependant out of game head please
i apologize that i have upset you by pointing out the flaws in your proposed changes to game mechanics but i have been very careful not to answer any questions directed at sabriz in fact you havent really asked any direct questions at all i encourage you if you do have some questions for sabriz you ask him directly in this thread or during his upcoming teamspeak session
genuinely very new players are insulated from this as the most expensive dedicated mining ship available to the less than one week old character is the venture whenever ive popped one of those and discovered the person is brand new usually discovered after the fact i usually advise them that they can replace their venture by running a different training agents missions i advise other gankers to do the same  the loss still matters but isnt cripplingmoderately new players 728 days can fly a retriever or covetor if they desire but generally in my experience they are more dilligent in it than most longer term players are and thus more likely to escape a gank attempt if they arent  its an easier loss to bear than a level 3 mission runner losing a battlecruiser to rats ismackinaws hulks orcas and skiffs cannot be flown by new players due to extensive skill prereqs
sure it does it makes it a cost not a riskthe risks in missioning or mining are things such as the risk of getting blown up while attempting to accomplish said task the same exists in ganking the difference is that if you lose a nonblinged mission fit battleship it might take 1020 missions to recover that loss with gankers the cost is considerably lower and the rewards considerably higher so if the gank fails chances are the next one will recover that lost and still be highly profitable in addition its incredibly easy to ruin a mission for someone jumping in and nuking the triggers for example will often overwhelm a player stealing mission critical loot or ganking the player also disrupts this with ganking its not so simple pretty much the only effective way to disrupt a ganker is ecm and even then youd generally need to be on grid with the target beforehand meaning the ganker can just pick a new target and youd need to blind luck your way to actually locking and landing an ecm hit on them code members laugh at the white knights all the time at how futile it is to try to stop a gankso yes ganking is considerably less risky than miningexcept that also needs to be balanced against the cost of ganking the ship as it stands ganking is cheap and has no real consequence as a ganker can simply use alts to do anything he cant do on the ganker thus things like bounties killrights and sec status are irrelevant a ganker flying around in a cheap disposable ship with an empty pod is hardly going to care if people around him can kill himthats not the purpose of ganking thats your purpose ganking is simply there so people can blow people up if they like their motivations for doing so are not part of the designagreed that concord mechanics been less predictable would be beneficial id certainly consider looking into adding more consequences to ganking however sec status should make it more difficult to freely roam around highsec and the ability to reverse your sec status should be considerably harder too personally id look at killsrights as well extending their duration and adding that they dont expire after one kill of any value but instead expire once the amount of isk damage has been done equal the the amount they caused getting the killright which would stop people being able to cheaply dump killrights with an alt
just because isnt really a reason ccp falcon and other developers for that matter has made it quite clear that there is suppose to be risk in highsec and he is explicitly saying that that suicide ganking is in the game so you the player have to make some tradeoffs you are responsible for not making yourself a target by overloading you have to balance yield and tank you have to remain at the keyboard you have to bring escortssuicide ganking is in the game to force these choices on players because presumably ccp thinks this makes the game more interesting and that this is good for the game if they did not think it good for the game then some developer has been extremely negligent for not fixing the problem during the last 11 years
no hes not hes congratulating emergent gameplay and stating that concord are a reactive not a preventative force at no point have i seen ccp state that ganking is possible so a group of idiots can fly around making sure noone carries too much and trolling i didnt say it wasnt good for the game either i simply said that what code say is the reason for ganking isnt the reason its actually possible that the balance between cost risk and reward needs to be seriously looked at and that theres very little in the way of consequences for gankers which is weird in a game where your actions supposedly have consequences
well youre welcome to believe what you like but that is not what he is doing he that is ccp falcon the lead community manager for eve is responding to the concerns of the community about sucide ganking by telling them that suicide ganking is an intended part of the game and they are responsible for their own security in highsec including not carrying too much cargo  or a sizable chunk of isk in his words i dont know how much clearer he could be that suicide ganking is in the game design from the beginning and what the developers expect the players to do to deal with it
repost from page 5how do you feel about making a wardecs cost based on the number of people in both corporations ie the more people involved the more expensive it is in total but the less expensive it is per personalso i heard you speaking about ensuring there is a significant amount of pvp and player ship destruction in areas with nontrivial resources how do you feel about the idea of taking nontrivial resources out of upperhighsec and allowing suitable protections it gives people a place to rest briefly or new players more room to get used to the game
i like the idea presented of a more interactive interface that responds to what the player is doing instead of spoonfeeding them content it is more adaptable and it puts a new player into an inquisitive mode where they get responses for their curiositycurrently the npe is funneling our players into structured content it makes sense until you remember that we are playing eve and the game does not feed us content but we must go and find it that means expectations are created that have to be corrected lateri think the goal of introducing the new player to eve in a grander scale is a good one being involved in helping new players as a csm member allows me to gather and condense common problems questions interests and concerns for ccp to use to help focus their development a csm member involved with new players can share what they are experiencing helping new players with their game the new players experience is different from a veteran player and we cannot structure all of the new player experience on the known playerUFFFDs knowledge we miss small obvious things because we are used to themthen as ccp develops a new player experience or tweaks their new player experience the early csm interaction helps get things on the proper path the recent graph showing the real average age of eve players has also said to me that if we approach this seriously weUFFFDd get some type of adult education foundations worked into whatever our new tutorial system is weUFFFDd use what we gather from the players see in rookie chat and know are hurdles that have existed for years and use modern tools to propose change and direction alongside of ccpUFFFDs grand scope of project

compare and contrast UFFFD the astero vs the garmurthe astero is probably one of the best ships that has been released in recent history it is versatile multipurpose and has fits and uses that augment almost anyones playstyle much the same can be said about its bigger sister the stratios it can solo it can explore it can blops it can even rat even though the game illneeded yet another droneboat the rest of the package literally redeemed its reliance on the overplayed weapon system that is drones into something new and mintyfreshthe garmur while undoubtedly one of the most powerful ships released in recent history is another beast entirely its sleek design is as sharp and focused as its purpose existing as either long range tackle or solo and plaguing faction warfare as an unengageable target speed and scrampoint range are the only things on its resume while every ship isnt supposed to have a diverse fitting profile the singlemindedness of combining point range and speed into new ship when kiting is already king leaves a bit of a sour taste while really cool the current meta neither wants nor needs more ships like thisbasically the sisters ships increased diversity the mordus ships just encapsulated everything that was overplayed by current field omen navy issues ishtars mass medium rails etc fast sniping stuff so this is where i stand on ship balancebrawling needs some love kiting setups are used almost exclusively to brawling set ups in many areas of the game i do not hate kiting at all just that too much of any one style is stagnationbattlecruisers basically went the way of the dinosaur once the patchday meteor hit previously they were a great balance point between size sp requirements cost and performance giving people something to fly that was just ritesized for some fun scientists still debate if it was just the warpspeed changes alone which caused their extinction with some pointing instead to other causes such as their performance versus other ship classes and their hulking mass which left them awkward at chasing the new preponderance of smaller prey items dumb metaphor aside battlecruisers and battleships need some love and adjustment the nestor and the barghest are almost never used whereas the frigate and the cruiser in their respective lineups are some of the most popular ships UFFFD when you cannot get people excited about a new battleship maybe it tells you something about how battleshipsbattlecruisers in general are suffering you are never going to see battleships outside of larger fights regularly until there is a need for them and there will never be a need for lumbering awkward giants so long as the only ships worth flying are small fast and kiting ships while in general i think its cool that the warpspeed changes brought some diversity they did so at the cost of wiping out entirely the age of the battlecruiser it is a sad day
piracy ganking and hisec in an ideal world there would be few pirates in hi sec as there would not be much worth pirating in hi sec they have chased the content to other security bands however i dont believe that is libel to happen any time soon hisec is too safe and people determined to create content there have too few options suicide ganking itself has about as much game play depth as video games in 1980 thats not to say it isnt fun just one dimensional so how bout we do a thought experimentimagine if there werent hi sec incursions however they have been replaced by something else pirate faction ess you would purchase these from pirate faction lp stores and anchor them in hi security space once anchored any capsuleer could spend 10 minutes in contact with the ess to get the following effectsimmunity to concordgate guns UFFFD the capsuleers ship is now masked as a serpentisguristasansha ship the pilots name is replaced with rogue serpentis capsuleer etcanyone may freely engage the capsuleers ship and is awarded isk and concord lp for its destructionif the ess is destroyed all ships that used it to go red are immediately concorded boom the ess is plainly warpable from anywhere in the systemlike cynos or incursions its plainly evident on the map one of these has been anchored it is a loopy idea perhaps too loopy but it actually is a content seed instead of just hurdling catalysts at things which is incredibly one dimensional there would actually be a riskreward paradigm do you want to actually try to fight defend and control a system or do you just want to use a boring tactic traditional suicide ganking would be in no way changedfor example imagine a typical saturday morning incursion groups begin to undock preparing to do the same dance with sansha they always do ganking groups likewise prepare for the herd of freighters to march down the pipes between the major hi sec hubs the former shoots red crosses the latter essentially is fighting against white crosses shooting them too quickly boring where pray tell is the player conflictnow imagine a world where some nefarious group has the audacity to put a pirate faction ess in uedama or nijara incursion group has content the ganking group has content neither of it is against npc crosses of any color thats winning in my book wrecks for the wreck god

response sent to email ill make my schedule work
i am concerned that the recent change in corp invite mechanics coupled with the proposed changes in intracorp aggression mechanics will result in more players ending up in terrible or even exploitative highsec corporations as their first corp these changes will allow bad and nefarious ceos to sit in starter systems and spam invites at new players as a way to make money at the cost that a new players initial experience with eve may be more frustrating in a small highsec corp that is unable or unwilling to support them in the end these poor corporations may cause many players to quit eve what do you think specifically can be done to get new players into good corporations that can teach and support them properly not only in highsec but in the other spaces further do you agree with the proposed changes to intracorp agression in highsec csm summer minutes pg 78 which will remove one of the few risks to the farming of new players through recruitment into exploitative highsec corps
that is a good question the previous game mechanic had the same strategy go to a starting system spam the corp ad but the new invite system definitely has a new level of issues most good corps run api verification even on new bros spam recruitment without process can and probably will cause more problems for the ceo than anything else i do think adding a control for access to new player friendly as a tag on the corp ad might be a good idea ethically i dont know that anything can be done without not teaching people the level of harshness this game can lay on them at times however i do think that the current system for searching corp ads needs a revamp i would also consider floating the idea of adding a search for a corporation into the tutorial to try and get people out into the player run corps

so im going to run at the encouragement of few but i think its a good idea ive been playing just over a year and spent all but a month in null sec i have a broad exposure to various things in the game but i still remember my new player experience im definitely not a bitter vet by any stretchso the csm is often made up of veteran players and those who are relatively prominent in the public eye im not really that guy i havent been endorsed by any coalition or corp or large group in any way i love this game and its still so much fun id like to represent the every man of eve and the relatively new players i think with some new perspective and fresh eyes eve can be even more awesome than it already is with some creative fresh blood in the mixfeel free to evemail me on this character and ask me any questions you may have suzy for csmnow proud to announce a partnershipsuzy rc mudstone will be running together with chance ravinne aka wingspan tt basically chance and i used to fly together shortly after we both started playing eve have had good times and have a generally similar outlook on the game hillarity fun and overall shenanigans are what eve is all about embrace laughing while playing eve
suzy rc mudstone for csmoorah
you have my vote suzy
thanks guys without you all it wont be possible
go suzy
i think having a newer player in the csm is a great idea especially with all the relatively drastic new changes that have happened over the past year it only makes sense
from cute newbee to csm in record time you have my vote good sir
got my vote
if you have ever talked or been fighting with or agasint suzy youll understand why they need to be on the csm the love of the game drives all of it totally got my vote  may not be the person want but so the person we need

oh ya
that is a crap ton of votes rock
ok i have no clue what you represent so i will just throw out a random questionmany say that eve is built on the idea of risk vs reward do you agree with this and if so what do you think is the most pressing issue facing the game from this view what is the biggest current problem resulting from an imbalance of risk vs reward and what would you suggest to fix it
thats a nice tryhard politics type of question but this isnt about that in fact its the opposite i thought that was obviousheres what i think suzy is good for breaking things down like im five and if you cant do that you probably dont understand it well enough what suzy needs to do is keep an inquisitive attitude and hear people out when they want to communicateits fresh and not a gimmick you me and everyone else qualified to answer your question thoroughly is already experienceheavy and probably too opinionated to reach an honest conclusionsuzy is sacrificing their love of eve for the good of us all i think its something we need and thats why im voting unironicallyyoud be planting a rookie into csm discussions which is otherwise impossible due to ndaask suzy what their personal and education background is youll be impressed
in response let me offer a bit of clarification hopefully i have in no way been hardened or corrupted by this game i honestly wish that we had a better retention rate for newer players not because im some new bro sympathizer but because more players is more things to shoot at or with that will always be a good thingpeople argue that ccp need to fix the game before devoting resources to other things the game isnt broken its brilliant fun there are some mechanics that need repair or rebuild as anything aging will need from time to time poses in the pipe corp managment in the pipe the tutorial missions they get minor little barely improvementsmost players dont even remember when they ran theirs others just dont care because the community will scoop up these players and push them down one path or another i tend not to refer to this as the new player experience because its not an experience it isnt epic it should be the tutorial missions should introduce mechanics in a storylore driven way make it an exciting introduction to this world we call eve then they get plopped into the main shard in their starter systemheres the absolute of my campaign eek this almost sounds like serious space business  the csm is meant to represent the everyone of eve sure every one on these panels has their own interests and passions the diversity in those is important representing the players of the game is just as important not just the space celebrities and those that are in leadership positions but everyone no i cant talk to everyone but i do try to talk to anyone who will talk to me ask anyone whos interacted with me i love to talk to people friends and space enemies alike
boosh putting the quote at the end of the post thats what fresh feels like sorry suzy im trying really hard to be quiet but this thread is just way too awesome sorry
that better haha its like i almost know what im doingno worries but i need to be exposed to the more traditional questions because i kind of do need to answer them if im going to represent the playersi have to be willing to interact with anyone and answer questions and i will as best i can
i love your enthusiasm and ive always been happy to support new players running for csmhave you seen this presentation on the direction that ccp is investigating for a completely different new player experience it seems somewhat different from your idea though the two could go together thoughtsas ive said in other candidate threads im less interested in getting answers and more interested in seeing how people think
i think it can go hand and hand and it was mentioned they are looking at how to motivate and reward i think that a narrative based coupling with all the tooltips and popups would be great concern would be with streamlining the popups and tool tips so we arent doing internet in 1996
now that the eve universe is a lot bigger than it was a few weeks ago how has the hauling experience changedwhat things are better what things are worsewhat are other haulers telling you
being blown up war decced or interfered with has never been a eula violation by itselfin fact all those things are design principles that ccp followsplayers are not entitled to success the most aspirational goals are coveted by many but reached by few balancing tears with laughter presentation fanfest 2013the only way the eula comes into play with regards to not enjoying the game is when players are being singled out over an extended course of time despite their best efforts to counter fight back or avoid it for no reasonagain even us pvpers have to make decisions and perform actions that we do not enjoy nope it still does mean something in highsec you can be at war but you are only at war with a small segment of the total population there if hostiles are not around you are safecompare this to lowsec nullsec and wspace you are effectively at war with anyone and everyone who is in your system at all times and you dont get a warning from concord when they come gunning for youergo highsec is safer than lowsec much more so in fact
look if people really wanted to pvp theyd go do faction warfare or nullsec blobbing or roam whspace what this thread is talking about being an issue is the ability to buy a permit to take a crap read declaring war on on mission runnersindustrialistsits not fighting its like a boxer in a bout with a 12 year old or usain bolt racing in the paralympics and then arguing that this competition is fair there is no contest in these wars the wardeccers are then claiming that the industrialistspvers can fight back much the same way that a paralympian can beat usain bolt
here is a rehash of my original argumentyou claim that pveers miners and industrialists cant fight nor do they want to fight fine they should then find someone else who can fight for thembecause the reverse of this is also truemost pvpers and combat pilots cant harvest build or trade to save their lives nor do they want to do those things so they find people to do it for themyou claim that it isnt fair for a 12yearold to fight a boxer well why is the child fighting in the first place  heshe should use hisher small stature and superior agility to slip away from danger  heshe can hide  heshe can then hire a guy named lenny lenny is a hulking mass of man lenny doesnt need to be paid for service rendered lenny is instead filled satisfaction and joy when smashing someone worthy of being smashed in the event that lenny cannot be relied upon the 12yearold can gather up all of hisher friends and arm them with sand see ecm sensor dampender energy neutralizers tracking disruptors lots of sand have you ever seen a fleet of griffins which they will throw in the boxers eyes repeatedly you claim it isnt fair for the fastest man alive to race against cripples why are the cripples playing fair if i was them i would throw nails all across the track or fire tear gasor better yet make it so the man has to pay through the nose to get his shoes pants shirt and anything else he needsmarket warfare is a pita for people with a poor mind for numbers
its not like there is a way for anyone to force pvpers to engage in these activities there is no way that your gameplay can be disrupted market pvp does not work as there is not one system or entity comprising the marketpvpers however can very easily disrupt the gameplay of industrialistsi get my fair share of pvp but i dont shoot miners back in the day i did my fair share of mining and stuff tooive done highsec wars and actually enjoyed them because the fights were reasonably fair i was fighting people who actually wanted to pvpin reference to op spamming wars on 60 corps is hardly pvp its buying targets to shoot who statistically wont shoot back
the game organically does this force pvpers to do something other than shiponship combatships mods and ammo are not freeergo a pvper either has the learn the fundamentals of pve industry trading and the market or get someone else to do all that for himheryou know how code has to bandorganize together to take down large or multiple targets yeah
not if the industrialist is smart they cantive served my time as an industrialist along with running missions yay for alts i lost a hulk once seven years ago to suicide gankers over the next 5 years that i played as an industrialist i didnt lose a single barge exhumer or hauler to either suicide gankers or wartargets at no time did a wardec hamper my ability to make isklearn to eve and youll never worry about wartargets or suicide gankers again
thank you much appreciated i think the absorb would be complimentary to other tools for example a damp ship could use more damp modules and have less tank knowing that some logi will be absorbing a lot of the damagethe problem with a lot of tools is that you are weighing them off against your tank usually if you are a shield tanked armour could have a bit more damage and speed so a fleet of ravens for the sake of example would probably only have 1 damp each now if there were 50 of them  logi and they meet 100 tengus the damps are pretty useless to thema because the tengus can probably fire from range beyond the dampsb because they only have enough damps for 12 of their opposing teamhowever say you have blackbirds for some reason in the fleet they could have in their six mid slots shield extender invul prop mod and three damps now say you have 10 of them and 40 ravents  logi that would be 70 damps far better odds they black birds could actually surive long enough to do some goodas for active tanking i had a suggestion thread where the shield amplifier would be able to convert some of the damage energy into shield energy so the more that are firing on you the more resistance you have they would need a few very high damage ships to take them outanother option is for the active tankers to be able to store some energy from logi just buffer up their shields or thicken their armour temporarilyedit realised something else with the absorb module idea dont have enough logi or turn it on before others and you could save someone but blow up yourself
without hesitation mike gets my 1 slot on my ballots what does it for me as far as mike is concerned is the fact that it doesnt matter the issue or the style of eveplay a person has mike will represent regardless if he sees the need to take it up with ccp go get em mike
answering in reverse orderim fine with rookie systems as an example of space with no nontrivial resources except the ability to strip mine in them and would have no issue with them being expanded to all deadend 10 systems rookie systems presently do provide an opportunity for someone to get back on their feet after a catastrophic loss and a place to learn the game interface and those are valuable functions of themwith respect to wardec fees i do not see why larger defender entities should cost more to wardec and propose a shift to a fee that is based upon the size of the aggressor entity and i proposed a formula  x05  10m where x is the size of the aggressor entity capped at 2500 the present system encourages people to sign up dozens of trial accounts to pad out the numbers in their corporation which isnt done much but could be a real nuisance if people start doing it
i love how you keep linking to posts claiming hes saying thing while the post says something else at no poitn has he stated that the mechanic was designed to restrict the amount of isk a player can load on a ship all of it irrelevant either way be cause it doesnt change the fact that ganking is too easy too low cost and without consequence
first of all big 1 from me just based on your initial few postssecondly what in your opinion is the largest issue facing the playerbase today and how could it be addressedthirdly i have reported lucas for his excessive off topic posting
lucas is useful he keeps bumping the thread so id rather he stays here there are three biggest issues id identify two of which i have ideas of how to fixfirstly stagnation in sovereign nullsec which is being addressed fairly effectively right nowsecondly the noninteractive nature of miningthirdly the fact that the riskreward balance of some highsec activities are so off balance that they are killing off other areas of space ill cover solutions in more depth in my ask me anything session in 45 minutes
much belated response now that i have working internet at the same timeplace as me having spare time this week is kind of crazy with holidayrelated travel for mei approve of many things but disapprove of one or two things with rises direction for the npe let me start by saying that im hugely happy with datadriven approaches using ab testing and user studies i very much like the new ccp approach of fairly rapid iteration compared to the ccp of old that released twice a year and stuck to guns when things were going pearshapedthe aspirations are overall pretty great about players feeling like they know what they are doing and that theyre being pushed towards interacting with others where possible and i think the tooltipsmodule renames are definitely great for wtf is this fleeting propulsion inhibitor and what does it do however im wary of approaches that rely only upon tooltips for conveying information for instance pretty much every single newbie i train still is very confused about the metat2 system because its undiscoverable even with tooltips it feels like whats important is to be able to provide players the option more information but only in contexts where it makes sense rather than making it a blocker to finding action definitely its a great step that ccp is thinking about making it easier for newbies to find action to get hooked on eve in general making the tutorial experience much less linear and more selfdirected definitely conveys better what eve is abouton the negative side however the work that rise showed didnt appear to actually push newbies into interacting with other players nor help them find other players that theyd get along with  although some caution there is merited about putting incompatible people in touch with newbies and trolling them out of the game perhaps it wasnt feasible in the case of the ux studies that they were conducting because said studies were not on tq  however getting that piece right i feel is going to need to be an important eve 102 thing once eve 101 is redone in the style rise describes
what are your thoughts on the state of small fleet vs large fleet balance what should ccp do to make small groups viable in lownullwhats your position on multiboxing
there are plenty of things that smaller fleets can do to harass larger fleets iff they can alpha through the logi reps of the larger fleet you should know that having seen pl successfully deploy petes and bombers against hero fleets to score a pile of kills plenty of times or from the afterlife harassing the  out of honor with cerbs then warping any time stuff got too close any solution along these lines to make smaller fleets better able to harass larger fleets is going to have to rely upon weakening logi by diminishing effects or just removing broadcasting for reps  however im not sold based on what i currently see that large fleets are necessarily overpowered in and of themselves necessitating that nerf yes ishtars online is an annoying balance problem but i dont think thats intrinsically a problem with the small vs large meta its a problem with the specific ship balance metathe first question you asked is orthogonal to the latter questionnpc nulllow my previous experience with npc null and lowsec says that playing station games is definitely harder for smaller lower sp groups to avoid getting stamped out what in the heck do you do when someone has a carrierbubble camp on your station that you cant hope to break without a pile of caps of your own and that will deaggress at the first sign of real trouble if you batphone in lowsec you can instawarp in npc null you can instawarp with a travel inty but its just a way to get out and set up shop somewhere else rather than actually being able to usefully fight back granted the cloning changes have helped a lot in that theres now no longer a very fixed and finite number of viable stations to live in so the scarcity problem of staging systems is less of an issue than it was before in which any new group would find itself contesting oversubscribed cloning bay stationssovnull making smaller less spintensive groups viable in null requires more gradations in quality of space fewer regions like the drone regions and period basis where you have to be blue to your neighbors to run logistics and making it so that its difficult and undesirable to hold more than one region at a time the way towards better null balance is having a totem pole with people with high numbers and skillpoints competing for the most desirable regions and not interfering with people with low numbers and skillpoints contesting the least valuable regions the changes to force projection have been good so far but havent yet fully solved some of the game balance issues that would allow smaller groups to take sov wholesale pfryarrpizza being examples of some of the first pioneers in this areaindication of repetitive lowattention gameplay see earlier answer to question about alts
vic jefferson is one of the most supportive individuals of new players i have ever encountered he has spent countless hours with me talking about skill plans ship fits teaching me how to fight and more recently how to rat did i mention the ships and isk he sent in support of these effortshe has lived in npc null for a very long time and still spends significant time in syndicate when not welping ratting carriers in gw space he knows this area of space is important for the game for transitioning characters and corporations out of lowsec and into null he also has knowledge of other details of the game as a long time player as a new player who has spent most of his time in npc null i have no reservation in endorsing his candidacy
will you provide a voice for the voiceless in new eden will you smack talk reds in every system you find them in and call them bitches
thats kind of my ultimate goal i think theres a lot of concerns that people have that are going unnoticed because they are being talked over because they dont have much voice muscle in the universe i think that identifying and addressing some of those would be beneficial to everyone at all levels of playalso a little bit of smack talk in jest is always good though sometimes individuals and groups get a bit carried away i think it goes along with the theme of eve being a bit harsh and lawlessto those abusing reporting mechanics with the sole intention of getting people banned id suggest they watch this video on ccps youtube channel
meanwhile elite dangerous announces its plans to add walking in stations and on planetsi remember when eve aspired to be the ultimate sci fi simulator now other more capable studios are stepping in to do it
exactly star citizen also plans on having this if things arent properly added obscurity will be the next place eve goesi am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i figure if they can be putting out outfits and such with just about every release then they should be able to expand the cq or wis in general at least a little biti would love to see pos be able to be used like the war barge in dust 514 kind of just a social meeting place for anyone hanging at that pos especially true for people living in wh space even more if you could see outside the windows at what was happening in spacethough i have a feeling the dustlegion teams will be doing most of the wis work but for right now its being used for dust its only a matter of time before those assets get shared in my opinion
this only makes sense if you ignore the fact that the paralympians in this example can pay someone tackle usain bolt and beat him like a redheaded stepchild every time he starts to catch up to them even better the paralympians god i hate that you used this stupid analogy in this case can strap on some bionic legs that put them nearly on par with boltif they refuse to do that its their own fault
eve is pvp centric almost every aspect of this game revolves around pvp even ship spinning so to even suggest some should be seen as a special case and some how wrapped in cotton wool to protect them from certain portions of pvp is quite frankly ludicrouswhy people should start playing a game which is well known to be this way then start complaining and asking for it to change just for them is beyond me lets face it its just plain selfish and without meriti will agree on one thing though war decs are broken they are simply far to easy to avoid which makes this thread even more ridiculousdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
do you have a link to this announcement
i missed the soundingboards
happy winter holidays to all my ideas supporters 
link is broken needs to have the comma removed from the link section
tora i cant speak for everyone but i personally look for a certain level of maturity in a csm candidate csm is a diplo position in many ways and you have to deal with ccp who are the most psychologically difficult alliance of all falling for lucass bait post shows a lack of that maturityyou can throw eggs and be as reactive as you want to be but it reflects badly on you more than anything this isnt lucass csm candidacy thread its yours dont insert 4 letter word here where you live or so they say
thanks for the advice but i am the kind of csm who wont take any bullshit and will speak up if needed if you prefer someone who just says yes all the time do not vote for mevote for tora if you want your voice to count
mike is one of the smartest eve players i have ever met i hope you make it this time as wellburn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
ask me anything happened and is posted here
whats your thoughts on fighter assigni both small scale a couple supers assigning fighters to fight roaming gangs and on large scale say assiging hundreds of fighters to a fleet to massively increase its dps and also to big interceptor fleets to kill structures in all cases with tiny risk to the super caps themselves
i feel that assigning fighters is a bit to powerful because you can simply slow boat inside of the pos shields with your supercarrier and you are safe the only thing that you might risk is your fighters which if would cost you around 200mil if you lose all 10 of them therefore i dont agree with the fact that super carriers should be able to assign fighters to people off gridi dont think removing the ability to assign is the only right option so i came up with some other possible solutions1 lowering tracking of supercarrier fighters because they are way to powerful especially when compared to all other capital example a titan has 0 chance of surviving when he gets pointed down while a super can just launch his fighters and clear hicsdics without a problem bit strange yeah i think so lowering their tracking will also result in less usage2 make it so that fighters are affected by warp bubbles just like normal ships doing this would make it riskier for super capital pilots to use these tactics and opponents will have a better chance at eliminating the fighter thread
xander has sexy voice there is no doubt csm needs that burn the land and boil the sea you cant take the sky from me
i anticipate having you quite high both on my personal vote sheet and on my recommended how to vote list
the last thing you need is more unmined belts and afk ratting in null it is not surprising that your candidacy comes with an obvious alliancecentric agendai agree with you that hisec is bloated the bloat from hisec should be used to enrich lowsec and lowsec only
the point is more about what all skill point levels can do for isk as someone who basically grew up in null i can tell you that there is really very little to do there as a newbie for cash mining comes with rats you cant kill at early sp levels anoms are out of the question until you are into a vni at a minimum exploration is mixed and the iskeffort not really spectacular i made my most isk by finding ded complexes for bitter vets to runfortunately in my corp folks like vic cut the newbie who finds a site in for a full share of the proceeds
theres plenty of rocks in null ive mined it when i was a blood miner in brave there are also plenty of people in frigates and dessies for newbies to go roaming against to destroy loot and salvagehow do people make isk with low skill points in highsec simple they mine rocks or they resort to piracy explo sites with low sp requirements dont earn anyone any money certainly not in hisec not without spending more time than you need to station trading isnt really under ccp control trade hubs go where people go and the holy trinity is iti flew and died in brave when an srp program wasnt in place so pardon me if im failing to understand explain the need for newbros in a 150 srp alliance to line their wallets with cash the point of surviving in null is working with the bittervets to earn isk and survive in fleets it would be hilarious for you to suggest otherwise for whyou are confused if you think low sp players are raking in hundreds of millions in hisec i fail to see what exact changes you are suggesting are made to introduce this possibility in null do you mean move some low isk explo and ded sites into null why dont you set up a short wh hop into hisec for your newbros instead seems like a much better solution to me and one that already exists in the gamewhen im talking about gutting hisec i mean moving isk opportunities for mid to highsp players out of hisec into low these opportunities should never be moved into bluesec unless we really are interested in destroying eveedit and why wouldnt your newbros doing industry and pi
answering for myself because they are boring require a stack of isk and sps better spent elsewhere in null at the start and require a whole lot more knowledge and experience than a real new player has also my alliance doesnt have srpeta and even if mining pi and industry didnt somehow bore the new player to unsubbing with the changes to jfs success at these professions requires a thriving local market which in at least my area of npc null just doesnt exist because its so sparsely populated which gets us back to the op granted that i assume that most people are in the isk generating grind to buy ships to get blown up because we all want to be bad ass space pilots shooting other nerds and laughing about it in locali agree with your other point though that there has to be incentive for players to leave highsec and i think vics idea is a good way to do it
i approve of vic jeffersons message and for csm and you should too ive tried to play eve for years i signed up in 2008 i resubbed in 2009 and in 2011 and finally go dragged back in by droog recently those first three times i came in alone in highsec and quit within a few weeks for many a new player sitting in front of space rocks for a few space dollars is boring thrashing waves of easy npcs for a few more space dollars lacks challenge and isnt why we get into the game we want to be space manfred von richthofen we want to go down in glory guns blazing ramming our ships into our enemies we want the thrill of the wildwest in space where a brand new player can help take down a 5 year old vet in a ship worth 10x more than your own we want what we saw in the this is eve trailer and those of us who started and quit so many times wanted what the 2008 no other destiny and empyrean age trailers promisedmy blood gets pumping and i get excited when i watch those trailers lowsec and nullsec especially npc null brings me exactly what was promised leave highsec alone i say those who want to mine or fly around in glided boats have their playground give us thrill seekers us warriors pirates criminals bounty hunters kings and vagabonds ours give a reason for a mass exodus into nullsec and the beautiful flames of war will bloom and the resulting scramble for resources will do nothing but help all players give us new players a place to become an eve ace a place where we can make a difference through glorious combat day onevote for vic jefferson for new eden for the new player for profit and for neverending showers of killmails
i do not believe i speak for a specific alliance or particular security band i hope to have the privilege of speaking for any who want more content seeds planted for those that spend far too much time searching for content only to have hours of empty space grate their will to play you know who speaks for the alliances who then will speak for youits easy to hate afk ratting but it does actually generate a fair bit of content on both sides of the equation especially with thera now you can get anywhere you want really to harass ratters whereas before i could see not wanting to go 60 jumps to get somewhereif i had to compare npc null is in more dire need of enrichment than low at least low has faction warfare in either case the issue is the same and both need work more people need to live and prosper out there instead of day tripping
i think you have to wait and see what bluesec really churns out to be after a few more patches before thinking about what needs to be moved in or out of it on paper we could be seeing lots of smaller entities continue to grab hold of a small part of sov which is a fantastic thing so you really do not want to pull out the rug from under them if new entities are actively fighting wars or defending their space can they actually sustain losses and is their space worth defending or taking i can understand reservations about buffing the income of a true blue doughnut stuck in an icyblue frosting of stagnation what about a thriving vibrant byzantine nullsecthe golden rule of all such adjustments is do the people who live in the space use itso long as members of null alliances use high sec for income nullsec needs adjustmentsso long as lowsec dwellers and npc nullsec dwellers use high sec for income they also need adjustments content is stifled at the local level when income is so routinely outsourced
ive read a few of your comments on poss on redditabout doing reactions on a planet you mention doing them in a station and having it need a station upgrade to do even thatcould you explain the throughts behind this and why you think its a good idea and why you think its necessary to force people to null do do reactions for drugs t3 polymers and t2 itemsyou also mention this doesnt make sense could you explain if poss do or dont screw a fleet upfrom my pov and this is mainly wormhole stuff pos defences arent really a issue at all if you know what your doing with the possible exception of dickstars in c1 which are annoying rather than anything else id imagine in null where you can bring way more numbers it also being the case
ooh whats your thoughts on hisec incursion income
well as everyone hates to do but upgrading a station to allow reactions to take place would make it significantly less frustrating as the majority of the value form goo is from the main pull from the moons alternatively have it be a low sec option as well with stations but taxed to reducing income a benefit of holding the stationsov to avoid the solid pull to null sec by itself i am a firm believer of keeping industry local and if given the option we know people would run ores to high sec react there and then sell it i think the continued risk is necessary however incorporating it into pi a system that is both frustrating and tedious even after its set up seems like overkill i want to see null sec industry rise to be more than capitol and super production as a focus and have t2 or t3 production local for alliances and making it easier potentially the balance for this could mean that the reactions take more time to complete with the risks to stations potentially increasing in the future the risks might be there apologies for typoon pos defense my alliance fought a maned enemy death star pos with several ecm units and a magnitude of defenses we got torn apart by it just like the russian fleet earlier that day a properly fit and manned pos can and will eat through a fleet regardless of a high eccm fit experienced logistics team as well as it can eat a dread it fit properly energy neuts and large guns wormhole commentsmy corp used to do day trips or weekend trips into low class wormholes just for some added content and without fail we ended up downing someones long forgotten pos despite not being able to bring much more than destroyers or cruisers in a c1 or c2 its been a while but it was worth the 5 hours or so we spend downing the large tower cause we made off with all the mods and a bunch of their gear as for incursions i love them they provide a specific skill goal for new players to earn a consistent paycheck while teaching the basics of fleet composition and fleet broadcasts i would like to see newer more challenging sites or different brands instead of just sansha make variety a bit better a lot of people say there is not a lot of risk in them i have seen ships lost several times in high sec incursions as for those that have their marauders pimped to run them quickly well that is a risk itself flying something that shinny a lot of the time its down to who you are flying with and the quality control of the fc to make sure his fleet members know how to broadcast i think its a great place for new players to aim for and can provide them with a significant pay check
but if the income is so good why would these players ever leave highsec to do pve do you think that model  that players pve in highsec but only do direct pvp in other spaces  is a good model for the game
the isk isnt as good as many other routes i use incursions for content if i get bored null sec is significantly more profitable i use incursions for my high sec corp as a benchmark to if players are ready to make the jump to null sec replying from phone sorry for poor formatting tldr incursions dont make what i make in null or running a site in wormhole space with blue loot can get you could use more variety to make it more challenging but then again to new fc without prior experience the current sites are hard made to look easy by communities that specialized in that content
ok so one thing that has bothered me ever since the new deployables came out is that there is no way to deploy them for corp or better yet passworded so that you can use it between alts and corp members as a member of the csm what is your stance on the multiplayer aspect of eve and how the new deployables ignore this
yesok ill embellish something i really believe in is the social nature of this game for me i come on after work and i want to talk to the people i play with i want to do things together as well i think that mobile tractor units certainly pose a minor barrier to this as do ess the mtu needs to be anchorable for corp if you trust your corp mates you should be able to set something up so that they can scoop the unitess also needs some rework because in their current state they seem to be more of a drama generator as much as they are an lp and isk generator
as csm will you still make an effort to continue taking us out on fleets from time to time your fleets represent everything that is fun about dying in a fire xoxo
absolutely this game is so fun even losing is awesome sometimes the seriousness of this thread is a bit troubling but its for the greater good i hope something we talked about last night was cloaky camping and the upcoming recon changes it was really interestingcheck out last nights podside podcast
hah nsfwabout what time in the recording are you the thing is 2 hours long 
its honestly worth a listen in the backround while you do other things we get pretty into it around 20 min put it on like you would the radio while youre ratting 
does the rc stand for radio controlled release candidate or is it a reference to a type of electrical filter circuitor are you just a fan of rc cola like i am if so please specify which flavor
rc cola is good but if youre from the north east stop and shop brand is on point as well though im unsure if they still make it
what the  did you just accuse me of

i love you
when i wardec a highsec industrial corporation i give them a clear set of terms for them to get the war to end1 buy mining permits for the whole corp2 put a pledge of support to james 315 and the new order of highsec in their bios and in the corp description3 all members agree to follow the new halaima code of conduct while in new order territory ie highsec in all my wars only one corp has complied with these terms so its not that they dont want to pvp they could have peace in a minute if they would agree to my demands its that they think they can ignore highsec pvp and do whatever they choose to do without interference its their principles this shows a clear misunderstanding of what eve is about at its root it creates calls like the op for more nerfs more safety less interaction eventually the death of the game despite their caveats what they truly want is to not have anyone have the ability to force them to do anything they dont want to do just fix one more thing ccp and everything will be good wont anyone think of the noobs here is the bottom line though there have been many nerfs to highsec aggression over the years and yet the industrialists keep dying because we always find a way and we always will by choosing to mine in new order systems highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct wwwminerbumpingcom
this is one reason i will not live in a worm hole againfrigate holes are just the most ridiculous thing i couldnt believe it when people first told me about them thought it was some sort of jokenow dscan immune ships coming is the incredibly low populations in worm holes not acting as some sort of indicator to ccp that something is wrong there
seconded not to mention the support for third party development which pretty much everyone uses in one way or another
each area of space has its own challenges the initial post of ideas were never a basis for my campaign but to act as a spark plug for getting to the down and dirty of these kind of issues while this approach may have turned the stomachs of manyUFFFD if one canUFFFDt identify the down and dirty from the player base then what good is the csm iUFFFDm here to listen and i want more of your ideas so letUFFFDs get down to businessa few ideas that were send to me your thoughts fleet escort  anyone within a fleet of someone who is unlawfully shot at immediately gains lock against that criminal the immediate lock doesnt make any sense but neither does the criminal ship being held in place unable to move this just helps those with any escorts or antiganker groups to react quicker in an attempt to defend the targetthe hideout UFFFD a mobile deployable unit that shadows criminal targets from concord while of course criminals will lose their ships and they canUFFFDt undock in another ship they could still undock in a pod and warp to this 15km area to hide in new ships the hideout will also tick down the timer twice as fast while they are in range and in a ship what this does is provide opportunities for anti ganker movements to hunt gankers who may find this unit useful to quicken their return to another gankwar evasion  this is still a legitimate problem itUFFFDs far too easy to just drop corp and reform a new one to me the solution is rather simple and in part already in game what happens when a corp leaves an alliance that is war decced the war doesnUFFFDt just drop anymore it satys with them for the remained of that warUFFFDs initial term bingo the same should be for players i think ccp didnUFFFDt want to lock people into their corp as it has been laid out in the past to do locking down a corp under war dec is too much if a player wants to leave let them but theyUFFFDll still be flagged as a war target for the remained of that week of time pure and simplemore content  random mission generation i think the damsel has been save over 10 billion times now missions need to stop being repetitious and be more random by random i mean to space and enemy deployment with unknown triggers random faction spawns mission that lead into nearby wormholes etc it needs to be more challenging and have such variety that players dont get bored some random mission elements should include limited engagement periods with other mission runners competing for the same goal or one is protecting something the other needs to destroy etc more interactive gameplay
now that is a proposal that adds gameplay and risk to the highsec criminal minigame gankers would get a small benefit but at the risk of being exposed to law enforcement 1your other two ideas i am more ambivalent on the autolock probably wont change much and may be hard to implement but it seems fine  a slight buff to haulers that bring escorts for protection might encourage the practice your wardec idea maybe a good solution but i think it should be coupled with more changes as i think it might be counterproductive to force a player to wait out a wardec if they really really dont want to or cant fight i would suggest a surrender mechanic would allow a player to optout of the wardec that follows them for a fee and banishment to the npc corp for one or two weeks make living in an npc corp a little more difficult higher tax rateslower mining cycles and players would have an incentive to stay and fight i think though more carrots to make a corp more attractive to live in would be an additional solution corp owned structures that like pocos that cannot be unanchored after a wardec is started that give bonuses to mission mining and industry activities players would have to defend those structures or lose them  a strong incentive to fight
fleet escort seems like an unnecessary one sided boost to hisec pvp what is the problem this proposed change would be solvingthe hideout is pointless with zero clone upgrade costs edit i reread it i guess i dont understand how pilots on gcc are undocking in shipswar evasion works for me but it fails to solve the larger issues with wardeccimg and may be a technical nightmare to implementmore content makes something that is grindy into something that is grindy and tedious content should come from players i think ideas that bring more content from other players into pve activity is more useful than hitting rand on mission objectives
leave the damsel alone i agree with adding more choices to missions but dont mess with every mission because you find them boringif you are bored do something else besides mucking up my game experiencei enjoy rescuing the damsel and feel happy if i get the mission twice in the same play sessioni also really favor things like the burner missions which are optin although i dont actually do them too much adrenaline for me
audacity is your friend freeware audio editing and easy to useperhaps if you do anything else like this however whoever is recording it from ts should do a mic check on each person and adjust individual volumes to bring everyone to a similar level the volume difference makes this pretty painful to listen to
thanks for the constructive suggestionsyoud think someone like me that used to work as a live gig sound technician would have a clue about that sort of thing but ive been out of that line of work for some years now
dwhen i get a minute free i plan to listen to it and feed back on the content too
thanks for all the support please feel free to post any questions
my fellow capsuleersmy name is khador vess and i hope to prove myself worthy of your vote to be part of the 10th council of stellar managementive been playing khador as my main since 2012 though my original main stretches back to 2008 and while khador is exclusively a pvp main i am the ultimate try everything at least once sort of guy im extremely passionate about this game the health of the game and the community around itim currently a member of rvb as a fleet commander team leader and im on the alliance tournament team having participated in the last three alliance tournaments my legion of alts have spread far and wide across the universe allowing my to try lots of different corps game play styles and  for example in the past ive been in eve university and dozens of other medium and large corps ive played a terrible spy tried my hand in fw ive lived solo in wormholes looking for both pvp and pve and much more beyond lastly im a sometime twitch tv streamer 
boosters  implantsdrugs are bad mkay well no they arent in eve drugs are at the moment a bit niche especially in hisec because making transporting and selling them can be awkward and theres no good reason for thiswhen i first started in eve i imagined myself as some sort of han solo running drugs and contraband across new eden and what i actually got made me sad this could be an amazing area of game play if there was something other than blind luck and guaranteed standings loss for moving them imagine instead trying to bribe customs officials smugglers holds in ships getting caught and making you suspect in the system theres so much more you could do with this area of the gameimplants need a second look as well in particular the current system for learning implants and pirate implants need a revisit in light of the clone changes recently id like to see more implants that affect your pod imagine an op interdiction nullified pod or specific ships and reviews of concepts like implant salvagingenabling hisec pvpi applaud the changes made and the progress weve had this year in improving pvp generally in the game from the recent clone changes to the pirate implants changes and interceptor re balances its been a good year for pvp and things that encourage pvp but weve also seen some things that worry me for example removing incorp aggression while i can see and acknowledge that this need to change to encourage new bros to join corps there are groups in the game this seriously affects rvb for example and although i know the current csm and ccp recognise this i want to make sure changes to core mechanics are properly counterbalanced by choice something that is at the very core of eve i can choose to join a corp with pvp incorp i can choose to join a corp that doesnt allow aggression i want to make sure this choice is something that can be made and made in an informed waymore tournaments and enabling player run tournamentsthe alliance tournament exists on the good will of a dedicated bunch of developers if they didnt put their free time to making this happen then things like the alliance tournament wouldnt exist and while we already have tournaments like the neo etc i want to push for more tournaments and for the tools to allow player run tournaments by improving on revising and expanding even abandoned concepts like the dojo perhaps getting volunteers access to special characters with some limited tools to help run tournaments with these people under nda and improving in game and out of game broadcasting tools to support these eventsbeyond this making eve sports more widely visible by putting tournaments on the front page of the launcher and possibly things like in game advertisements is something i think needs to get some attention i would also like to see more acknowledgment and rewarding of the enablers for these in game tournamentscorporations and alliancesas a recruitment manager i feel this pain day in day out managing roles managing members advertising the corp to new bros banning users accepting new members etc it can be really hard anyone who has managed a corp of more than a handful of friends will have felt this pain as anything like granting access to pos hangers roles is clunky and far too complicated it needs to be made easier to manage and perhaps even crest enabled to allow management of these resources in the same way we manage our comms servers forums and other oog resourcesi want to make sure that this aspect of the game gets its time in the sun that due consideration is given to what needs looking at here and making sure that the management system is fit for the decade to come3rd party app developmentthe improvements made in the area of 3rd party  api this past year are a testament to the work of the dev team there and the current csm but this still needs further work first and foremost the development of crest please please please give us readwrite access to things like skill queue mail etc documentation improvements sso updates and improvements etc lets give the tools to the people who create the great apps and systems that compliment the game so muchsov  null fixeslast but by no means least we need the long overdue and promised changes to sov this has now become one of those items that just needs to be fixed to show us that its being taken seriously i believe that now is the time to start feeding back some of the thinking to the community even if just a bit more flesh on the bones communicate more often has to be the message delivered herewhile we await solid plans for change from ccp my position is one of wait and see we have heard from a vast array of people on the issue of sov  nullsec changes the current csm have put forward some ideas the community has fed into the process so now we need some plans from ccp and soon so we can provide concrete feedback on their thinkingwow that was a wall of text i would like to thank you for reading though to the end here and i hope that i prove worthy of your trust your time and your vote for csm xthanks and fly safe o7k

i am glad that you recognize the negative effect that highsec incursions are having on the other spaces it is poor game design to have something with so little risk pay so lucratively and is making low null and wh space much less vibrant than it could be if people were incentivized to make their isk in the spaces where they liveroam rather than returning to highsecin keeping with this idea of the balance of risk vs reward i am curious to know your thoughts on the current state of highsec corporation mechanics one of the major problems as i see it is that currently the mechanics do not make it clear whether a corporation is suppose to be a social club where players can form a social group and hang out and do stuff or a true competitive entity that is fight with other groups for power and resources right now there is little reward for being in a corporation in highsec while there are risks wardecs and awoxing and these little rewards that there are not tied to any particular corporation so there is little reason to actually fight for your corp if wardeced  its often better to drop and reform or hop to another corp i would like to ask do you support the idea of a lower tier of corporation that would not have any of the risks of a real corporation but also none of the rewards further what mechanisms do you think could be added to the game to make real corporations more persistent and worthwhile for members who take the added risks and that would make them want to fight for the corp or hire mercenaries to protect their corpfinally on a related issue what are your thoughts on on the proposed removal highsec intracorp aggression highsec awoxing as described on pg 78 of the csm9 summer minutes
if you have a pos you cant just disband your corp making it so that gameplay in highsec is much less profitable without having an online pos and not allowing unanchoring of poses during the 24 hour spinup prior to war similar to how pocos cant be transferred out from a corp pending war would help a great deal in terms of preventing corp cycling however disclaimer disclaimer i dont run a highsec corp  highsec is just a place that i go to as the last stop in my logistics runs someone like mike or sabriz might be much better qualified to speak to that pointyes the npsi community etc needs love better tools for managing the membership of combined mailing listschat channels would help i would think of such communities as interfaces in java terms where you can have more than one whereas first class corps are subclassing poses and pocos are pretty much the tools we currently have at our disposal right now as far as fixed reasons to maintain a corp in highsec so making it so that poses and pocos are more lucurative to own would help tremendouslyi am ambivalent actually i think one of the major barriers towards corporations recruiting newbies is that the corps are afraid of 7day hero alts awoxing and also on the flip side reverse awoxing 7day old legit newbies is  downright vile but on the other hand nullsec deals fine with the potential for awoxing even without concords help so i support awoxing in general as a mechanism to weed out and kill bad highsec corps that dont actually teach newbies anything and just leech as a 10 or 20 tax moneymaking scheme off the backs of newbies wardecs however also can be used to the same purpose so perhaps wardecs are an appropriate counter if they can be fixed according to your points aboveedit to add i love almost everything about psychotic monk especially the big red wardec newbie effort but i was very disappointed in him when he started a reverse awox corp that advertised newbie friendliness and said that the way that newbies could avoid getting reverse awoxed by him was looking at the corp window once they joined a new corp and going to the corp killslosses tab under wars and looking for reverse awoxes really really thats super undiscoverable  
i agree  making poses more relevant and harder to unanchor like pocos andor the addition of new significantly expensive deployables that are vulnerable like pocos but provide a bonus to the corp for some activity would go a long way to allowing a highsec corp to determine their own tolerance for risk vs reward if they want to be relatively safe they can avoid such vulnerable assets and pve with friends or solo or if they are up to the challenge they can deploy significant shared assets to increase their income but at the risk that they might come under attack from someone and they will have to defend iti also agree with much of this the practice of exploiting the lack of knowledge of legitimately new players is deplorable and actually reverse awoxing someone who just started the game and is looking for a corp is not cool however if you take a look at zkillboards awox category i see very little evidence this is a problem at all  by far the largest number of highsec kills are from rvb other obvious intracorp sparring and the small number of actual awoxes there are against expensive industrials flown by players with typically years of experience in the game in fact i cant find any evidence of a reverse awox corp actively preying on newbies anywhere there although i guess if such a corp exists they might not have their api registered and neither might a newbie it seems to me the increased risk for a new player to end up in a bad highsec corp run by a terrible or nefarious ceo because of this increase in safety is a much worse to than the slight chance they will actually get reverse awoxed which this change doesnt even completely prevent  only for newbies joining highsec corps i am not adverse to a social corp that is immune to awoxing and wardecs where new players and risk averse players can form a group with no benefits of a corp like keeping taxes but an actual corporation should be required to defend itself from threats both external wardecs and from within awoxescorp theft anyways i like what i am hearing so far best of luck with your csm campaign
they arent api registered on purpose to make it harder for carebears  newbies to just look at zkillboard to detect that theyre reverse awox corps carebears wont have personal killboard apis on file and the reverse awox technique relies upon not being killboard registered still doesnt help the case of a corp thats trying to recruit newbies though  a lot of good corps wont recruit newbies at all because of awox risk so they instead put in bullshit requirements like minimum 10m sp in order to raise the bar to entry to having a nontrivial amount of time playing the game so that its unprofitable on a plex basis vs what someone would kill and thats what i understand the core of the argument is for removing awoxing like i said complicated issue and more data would help but only ccp has that data for the most part
i understand this argument but dont buy it good highsec corps that are interested in training new players already have ways to protect themselves  like dedicated training corps for new players  but they require some work all this does is lower the risk for lazy and clueless corps to spam invites as there is now much reduced risk to themselves competent highsec corps are still going to be careful due to the other risks of infiltration spying theft etc and not change their behaviour towards inviting new players but the proliferation in terrible corps run by players that dont understand game mechanics spamming invites in starter systems are going to snare more new players into corps that arent capable or willing to train and support them properly leading to a more frustrating experience than necessary for many starting players i dont believe that there are a mass of reverse awoxing corporations hiding off the killboards killing newbies in large numbers but as you say only ccp has the data if they came out with a devblog tomorrow saying that i am wrong and 25 new players are reverse safaried each month and most quit the game then i would reverse my position although these hypothetical corps could just move to lowsec and keep reverse safariing with this change so i would advocate for additional protection for them than just changing highsec intracorp agression i dont think that is the case  the number is probably much closer to or actually is 0 than 25 i think this is just a change pandering to some highsec players continual demands for increased safety at no additional workcost but it doesnt really matter what i think as you are running for csm and this is your thread
if you made your decision without regard to whether you are getting support from blues this begs the questions do you have support from your blues if you dont have full fledged support from your blues why should reds vote for you
i do have some support from my blues but its not my announcement to make about heros voting recommendations or who else is running but my belief is that brave will overwhelmingly vote for candidates from brave as their first priority i am not a bloc candidate like i said in the earlier response consider me to be in the same position malcanis was in for previous csm elections  someone experienced that wont be ranked 1 or 2 on a bloc ballot and therefore needs to get broad grassroots support to be electedpeople should vote for me if they believe the perspective i will bring to the table is valuable for the csm a wellbalanced csm is important to the longterm health of the game i represent a set of players that otherwise likely wouldnt get a significant voice on the csm in terms of 50500 character groups of players
agreed that that very much is a risk of removing awoxing and is a factor pushing me away from supporting removal of awoxing like i said its a complicated issue and i can see good arguments on both sides and will be thorough about devils advocating and making sure all the arguments are clearly stated and understoodhowever i think its terrible mechanically to segregate new players in a new player ghetto you were talking about making player corporation membership mean something ducking things by putting new players in a separate corp until theyre fully trusted seems like a backwards way of handling things
a pi alt with 20 days of skilling can net you half a plexs worth in a month of purely passive isk the skillbooks will cost about 10 million its really a matter of poorly utilizing the space in which money making opportunities already exista throng of newbies who can just shoot things dont get to eat to eat you need to know how to collect and cook food and alts in this game are a thingin terms of the market in npc null being scarce this is nothing a csm member is going to change uncapped hope is a thing but we are arguing mass market mechanics here
you can live in a nullsec pipe dream if youd like but im presenting you my viewpoint of nullsec as it stands even with the travel changes from the previous two expansionsnot convinced by this argument hiseccers may need to go to wh or null for better industry and pve drops it doesnt mean we bring these into hisec as a reverse argument not being able to leave your couch doesnt mean the fridge has to come over to where youre sittingbeing too lazy to organize logistics out of your space to facilitate income is a poor reason for instituting change introducing risk and challenge and danger are good reasons for advocating change ill agree with this pointi hope you dont mind the discussion unlike some other csm candidates you actually read posts and reply thoughtfully to them i wish you good luck with your candidacy
i was under the impression it isnt just a matter of skills though but of the initial investment in interaction equipment access to pocos transport ships which in npc null at least syndicate have huge targets painted on them access to planets etc however im willing to concede the point since ive never really looked into it in great detail nor talked to the folks in corp necessary to get involved in pi and our discussion is becoming somewhat tangential to the campaign thread
i dont think its a problem when hi sec natives come down to lower security bands that is a good thing they should be motivated to step into the unknown in the name of profit and they should be left felt wanting at what hi sec offers them the question then becomes why are so many low and null sec dwellers are motivated to come up to higher security bands to do missions or incursions as their bread and butter part of the reason is that there simply isnt enough reward compared to the riskeffort ratios they could get in hi sec thus another source of local conflict fails to sprout
this is so true c4 and c5 wormholes have been basically destroyed by the presence of highsec incursions why put a 1520b capital escalation fleet at risk in a c5 or a pair of 3b marauders at risk in a c4 when you can make 7090 of the isk per hour with much lesser logistical concerns in highsecthe more of vics posts i read the more i endorse what he stands for even though we do not have 100 agreement and i have no loyalty to his alliance
im curious to know why noone has addressed this yeti read the csm minutes every time theyre released i read them several times over specific people saying specific things gets lost in the details but what ive quoted above directly violatescontradicts the publicly disclosed stance of ccp through the minutes and while its not a surprise i think its worth more than just a footnote in your campaignyoure a volunteer peer reviewer pretty much from what im able to gather to publicly state the things you have above is pretty damning really of ccp youre running for csm 10 but i havent seen mynnnas declaration yet any other goon candidates this year to be honest i havent checked im mostly interested in recurring terms like yours i appreciate that youve avoided using lofty rhetoric for the most part your honesty about ccps position on their own institution is also appreciated i just wonder why youre doing it again i mean its pretty clear the csm is being progressively marginalised and that last year especially was a pretty clear indicator of that and then the sudden resignations of 2 csm members this year as welli would run for csm too but not for the same reasons you do i think
the last rat i shot for isk died in 2009 oh right suzy umm a lot of players rat happily but in the opinion of those who rise above its suckie gameplay
it is fairly mind numbing however its the best iskhr ive been able to find with my modest skill set seeing as the barrier to entry is minimal i dont think it needs much to change just be smart and optimize
recently ccp wanted to give a force recons a small balance to give it immunity to direct scan as it was before you should click direct scan button once a minute and at least you had an option to get situation in the near field but now even after pressing this button you cannot know the situationwhat does it mean simple you are becoming more nervous your game becoming more slowerbecause you need to check moremore checks  more time game is slowerin my opinion good idea would be to change direct scan system give it more deep and get rid it from scan now buttonyou can add more parameters for your ships similar to stealth technology bigger ship has better radar but has more surface of reflectionas for the direct scan you should make a 3d radar at last something similar to this space radar from nasa sitei dunno how much load this will add to your node but for the large scale fights you can jast say that large fleets are creating distortion and maximum scan range is cut to some point 
just a couple of observationsi suspect the final solution for sov mechanics will include some similarities to your proposal but there are a couple of things to considerthe conquering cloaky camper can be a thing your proposal only requires ships in space who sits in space better withless drain on the system resources so less annoying tidi than the cloaky camper  armed with the basic gun from a freerookie ship or maybe a prototype cloak on a battle badger the cloaky camper can sit and drain the efforts of the sov holding alliance while they are at work or outside or asleep and if the enemy counters with their own cloaky camper then theattacker can simply counter with a multitude of cloaky campers and simply out blob the enemy with a cohort of cloaked campers the attacking and defending fleets could save all that time maneuvering for position or probing for warp in points the two fleets could just float in space and be invisible to each other the entire time a second point is that occupancy and numbers can not be the sole criteria if that is the case you leave no room forskill training strategy or leadership to make a difference or for a smaller skilled well led force to make an impact on the outcome under your scenario say 10000 pilots under a fleet commander named perses show up in a system the 300 defenders show up under someone named king leonidas count the 10000 opponents and say oh well and leave we wont need dramatic tension filled battle reports every battle report could just be a census tally
hmmm i thought ccp was always trying to find ways to get people more involved with pvp when did they start going the other waypeople need to start figuring out that eve is a pvp game with elements of pve not the other way aroundwhile i have been on the losing side of an awoxand yes it does suck it did sever to give me a lesson on 1 trust is expensive and 2 pvp is way cool even when your in a retriever getting blasted by a hurricane
hi steve in response to angrod losshelin running for the csm with a platform that includes multiboxer representation what do you feel about the current voting mechanicsshould the voting mechanics be restricted to one vote per person if owning another account is enough justification to earn an individual another vote towards the csm would you support allowing another vote to those who use multicharacter training on a single accountthanks in advance
would it be nice to limit to one vote per actual person yesis it viable nonot worth talking about any more
remember these are not my ideas but from people who support me the main reason i post them here is to see how the community dislikes it i just collect sort check feedback analyze filter and use the output for the csm campaignthe hideout is something i do like myself it gives both sides new options its simple and it eliminates the other ideas about timers kickout of stations etc that some had issues withthe ideas about being afk undocked and on same grid and ganking ideas have been updated in the original post
while i think your heart is in the right place some parts of this i feel are kinda nope some ideas im hearing from my ts right now1 limit the number of wardecs one can give and one can recieve2 make it really hard for gankerscum to live in highsec youre a marauding criminal and a mass murderer why the hek get it hek are you allowed to dock in a station in hs3 remove the tags you can buy youve killed people to get your low sec status you need to work your butt off to get back there pirate scum4 more penalties for suicide ganking its too easy a timer system similar to fatigue for killing people in highsec timers that prevent you from undocking leavign a pos ect also if we push them to low sec or null sec that means more people moving around more moving around means more pvp more pvp equals a better eve pirates should live in less secure areas because the secure areas are dangerous for them making it so gankers cant live in highsec would be great for the game they can go there just cant live there so theyd have to work for it unlike now in comparison5 bounties are a joke killrights are too fix them so they have more consequences
1 i can see where you are coming from with this its not a terrible idea and possibly worth considering im not sure it would be helpful though2 life is already pretty damn hard unless youve lived it you have no idea3 no have you ever payed for those tags they are not cheap4 this is just laughable i wont even say anything more about it5 fully agree on this the bounty system is less broken than it was before but still needs some work kill rights arent really so bad but most people do not use them properly i think killrights should provide free locator agents as well as a brief guide on how to make use of killrights properly ive personally had killrights and i used them to kill the aggressor in his hulk got his pod too ive had lots of killrights against me and only one person has ever used them for anything useful
fleet escort  two words sensor boosters your guys use these all the time i dont see this change really doing much as unless the group brings enough dps to shred a significant amount of the gank fleet before concord shows up they arent going to be able to stop it instant lock or not in other words this addition wouldnt accomplish anythingthe hideout UFFFD this idea is really cool as a ganker i can say that sitting in a bubble watching your timer tick down and hoping against hope that a white knight fleet doesnt show up to slaughter you the incentive to use it of increasing the speed at which the timer ticks down is really good and would definitely make these worth using bowheads would see a lot more use as well giving white knights the ability to have a meaningful impact on the gankers and their activities would be really coolwar evasion  i fully agree that war dec dodging is a problem im not certain that this approach is the best though perhaps when you declare war against a corporation you can optionally identify one or more members of that corp if you do those members will still be war targets if they leave the corp this would increase the fee for activating the war this would allow you to pursue specific targets if the war dec is a targeted attack or a vendetta but would still allow the less important to the aggressor targets to leave the corp if they really dont want to protect it couple that with more carrots for remaining in a corp and things should improve on this frontmore content  these are some cool ideas and i would support themyou might earn my votes back yet mr bushido
they still wouldnt be able to but they could reship from an orca bowhead or unpiloted ship when they reach the module or carrier if and when they become allowed in hs again
1 why would you nerf something if they are ok with paying the bills for it  what if someone would have said limit the number of titans in1 alliance  or limit the number of enemies in one nullsec system  sounds just as weird to me2 ganking is part of highsec nerfing it would be bad for eve and ganking isnt mass murder 3 i had to buy tags to get back from 10 to above 0 i still feel the isk pain lets keep them anyway4 why push people to low and null if they want to be in highsec  people decide themselves where they want to play5 bounties are a nice extra but need a lot of work to be useful kill rights are ok if it would be easier to see who has them on who
if you go by the lore the ships actually have full crews then it is mass murder however that line of argument would also make concorde the worst perpetrators of mass murder in human history
i agree that more information about people you have killrights on and who has killrights on who so you can contact them and work out an arrangement and maybe a variety of other possibilities would make killrights more useful
1 vov2 ive fought it though it was just a sequence of warp to insta gank lose ship dock in pod rinse repeat no way to evict or combat outright hid from wardecs and use system i said above the manipulation of the mechanics make it so its pretty easy to evade any strife3 your point neither is a supercarrier but yet theyre still prolific too easy4 more risk more reward problem is there isnt any real risk to ganking some guy in a freighter youre going to lose the ship anyway so why would that count as risk you cant be shot if sec status isnt low enough you can manipulate mechanics to avoid getting a confrontation you can dodge wardecs if a bumper i hate you kalorned even if you lose a ship it was going to die anyway so it doesnt matter yet you can sacrifice a 10 million isk dessy and reap in massive profits from ganks or a 70 mil just guessing talos but that isnt really that much where is the risk then when i rat out delve i face much more risk than you do in hs null is riskier than low low is riskier than high but you have an altogether lack of risk for ganking while the freighter pilot has all the risk sometimes by just flying to thing killing empty freighters is the silliest thing after you kill you hide in station to rinse and repeat 5 dat least we agree on something
hi mike in response to angrod losshelin running for the csm with a platform that includes multiboxer representation what do you feel about the current voting mechanicsshould the voting mechanics be restricted to one vote per person if owning another account is enough justification to earn an individual another vote towards the csm would you support allowing another vote to those who use multicharacter training on a single accountthanks in advance
i understand where you are coming from on this one    it does feel like it is possible to buy the vote but i would not push to change itchurchhillthis is representational democracy with the account not the person being the ones represented like stocks in a company the more you put into it the more you have a small say in what happens the sheer magnitude of the task to decide if two accts belong to one person would also not be something i would ask ccp to try brothers wives whatever there are households that play how they keep from stabbing each other at night is beyond me do multiboxers have a slight advantage in the elections maybe but then so do large voting blocks groups of friends or even people who hotdrop podcasts i think i can live with it and accept the competition as said multiboxers have the same right to representation as other players doa process has been banned a style of play not the players they can adapt    or leave    or be asked to leave but until the time that they are gone they have a right to the vote one per account just like the rest of usmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
hi sabrizaudacity does make audio editing very easy i dont have any experience in sound technology but im able to do all the basic editing for the soundcloud files in this little program i got better at it as time went on but im still learningit takes time though and you have to be prepared to listen again and again  and critically  to your piece i think youre just a rather busy pilot at the momentall the very best for your campaign and more immediately for the coming holiday
yeah im ridiculously busy irl organising maintenance for a boeing 737 repossessed from a now bankrupt airlinei think i need to take the stress out on some freighters soon
and yet youll have time to be on the csm history shows its a very busy role to fill
i work 9 to 5 with occasional flareups im not unmanageably busy often i just happen to be right now even at times like this i find time to log in to eve manage trades and still get to the gym irl
hi sugar in response to angrod losshelin running for the csm with a platform that includes multiboxer representation what do you feel about the current voting mechanicsshould the voting mechanics be restricted to one vote per person if owning another account is enough justification to earn an individual another vote towards the csm would you support allowing another vote to those who use multicharacter training on a single accountthanks in advance
i am comfortable with the current voting mechanics they are not perfect and it leaves loopholes because they can use the same isk or income to open another account and gain another vote instead of dual training and only keeping the one vote i do not believe that giving each actively training character on an account an individual vote would do anything more than fluff vote numbersthere are advantages to organized players who coordinate their votes iUFFFDd like to see one vote per player but until ccp has a method to consistently separate the player behind the accounts from the accounts restrictions have to be absolutely consistent as not to cut any player off or decrease their access to representation
i approve this message khador vess 2015
gorski youre a really cool guy in your own weird ways  you had my vote last time and youll have it again theres something about you that is very easy to dislike on autopilot but i get the feeling that when push comes to shove you are able to put on your serious face and do some real good for the gamei dont know what you did in csm thus far and i probably wont have a clue what youll be doing if youll make csm again my involvement in eve never went that deep which is why i think its important to have at least one pilot who really know solosmallgang pvp in csm to carry the torch for the rest of usif im not mistaken you often fly with links i know many people have issues with ogb but i like the fact that you really know what it means to fight a linked ship when you dont have them yourself the difference it makes many pilots just complain about links but have no idea what it really means i really liked the way logan described links in one of his videos used and abused which is a fine balance without links some aspects of smallgangsolo pvp would be destroyed just as links themselves can destroy the experience for an unlinked solo pvper so that fine balanced needs to be addressed by someone who knows both sides of the scale inside out if some highsec ganker who makes csm nothing personal against anyone i dont even know who else is running even touches a linksrebalance issue thinking heshe know what links are without ever having flown a 5 pilots smallgang wlinks deep into null doing gurilla warfare against 100 locals not understanding what links mean to those 5 in such a situation then just like that  csm will fail small scale pvpers instantly and the same can apply to various other issuesill write something else now that i think is good to just put out there i feel that ccp fail to give a proper platform to pvp video makers they are just beginning to understand the power of videos but they are still babies when it comes to this pointpersonally i got plenty attention views criticism feedback for my videos but i throughout the years i have seen dozens and doznes of solosmallgang pvp videos that were literally much better than mine go almost completely unnoticed and fade away with only a couple hundred views ccp fail to understand the influence that a good solo pvp can have on bringing new players into the game i got more messages through youtube than i could count of people that never played the game having seen my videos asking me questions about if they should begin playing and how it would be to the incredible benefit of ccp to create some sort of platform for pvp videos to be seen in an official capacityto take it out of the elitemyeveoutofreach mindset thats basically an illusion anyway niche it got to become where experienced pilots brag to the other 10 experienced pilots who roam the same subforum and rarely get seen by the other 999 population of new eden and more importantly the population of people who havent created an account yet but would have access to see those videos in one way or another if such a platform would be created eve has the outside worlds curiosity it always had it always will and there are few better examples of the beauty of eve than solosmallgang pvp anyone can feel the pure fun of the player when watching a good smallgang pvp video even people that never played the game can sense it i dont think ccp realize how many subscriptions they got say in the last 3 years from people running into random solosmallgang pvp videos in youtubewhen a solo pvper roams endlessly timewise against the odds through the blob losses and records then edits a video which can be a time consuming effort in itself and finally releases it only to recieve 400 views and a bunch of criticism from elitists because more or less only the experienced pilots get to see his video rather than a whole bunch of cool from less experienced pilots then its very easy to give up on ever doing it again and even resent the game for it ccp dont see that those pilots are offering them gold for free they do things like this contest for video makers to make a new trailer this is eve style which is a cool idea but it can even do some intentional harm think about all those that created videos and never got a second look they dont have the amazing editing skills that ccp want for that grand prize what they have is skills understanding of the game and patience to roam until they find those rare fights record them and edit them the best they can into their own little pvp masterpiece it will never be a top edit piece of cinematic but it will have the true essence of eve inside of it the spirit of the pvper they dont need some 100 plex heck even 1 plex through a buddy link in their video description or a donation from a viewer can be infinitely more substantial for them than some grand prize give those pilots a new platform that can be theirs and just watch how much life is injected into smallscale pvp it can be an alliance tournament level excitement all year roundit is very easy to overlook solo and smallgang pvp because on the surface it seems like a small part of a big game but it is not so first and foremost eve is a pvp game and a true pvp game without the possibility of a healthy solo pvp aspect is a dead gamemake small scale pvpers happy and youll see the effects on the entire game more players more activity in previously dead systemsconstellations more videos more creativity more general understanding of mechanics more fit discussions more everything it will leak to every other aspect of the game it wont be noticeable that the things are connected itll be hard to connect the dots but the connection is there in the very core of the sandboxdont have questions for you just a thumbs up 
i honestly think part of the problem is that during balancing or rebalancing the idea that you can earn isk in total safety is not factored in or weighted properly being immune to pvp as a default until a ganker takes exception eliminates a lot of dead time and adds a lot of logistical value into the isk per hour equation
in reply to your blog post scanning rigs  while this is something id currently consider a little thing in the scheme of things as most players in the wormhole community at this time arent likely to be the sort flying t1 frigates i see that your vision for npe toward wormholes would mean this adjustment for scanning rigs for those newer players first thoughts on npeim not against npe to wormholes across the board but i dont see wormholes in general as a new player experience nor do i want it to become something that is easy enough for any new player to experience wormholes and the mechanical understanding required to live in them is somewhere after the learning curve corppos management fittings implants drugs various and relatively more difficult pvepvp fleet and ship management etc and although wormholes have become easier over the years with help from training documenting and thirdparty tools i dont want to theme park the experience so to that end im of the opinion that npe for wormholes should be reviewed and developed very carefully as to not end the frontier completely as far as the rig changes this is fine wormhole npe  at one point last year i talked about how it would be nice for ccp to create tutorial missions in the exploration side that would allow players to probe down a generated wormhole that would lead to a specific mission area somewhere and allow them to complete a mission against sleepers it would likely conflict with lore unless worked around and would have to be limited to maybe the player who generated the mission or those in fleetgang with himher to prevent nastiness that or make the mission area highsec rules which i dont care for unless the plan would be to have different level missions that allow players to work up to the dangerous level of wormholes where the higher wormhole missions would be 10 no local and anyone could scan down not sure on this as ive said i dont feel wormholes are npe but im irrelevant p pos mechanics  ive been setting uptearing downinfiltrating poss in wormholes for a long time and at this point i say to let ccp develop a permanent fix to address all current concerns and not waste any development time on bandaids thats all multiboxing  you quotei dont agree with this statement as many wouldnt it isnt an accurate statement a multiboxer is someone who actively plays multiple accounts at the same time i have many accounts and i am only multiboxing if i play more than one at a time that is the definition of multiboxing multiaccount  multiboxthat said mutliboxing is a playing style and since all playing styles should be considered so as long as they adhere to the eulatos i appreciate your concern with representation to a familiar playstyle to each their own edit spelling
yes exactly i do not want to see wh space become anything less than it is i simply want an increase in people to shoot what better way to do that then to expose our awesome slice of space to new brosi think this would be best handled in an instanced or roomed wh for new players something non exploitable i agree and with the new proteus patch announcements this looks to be happening but we will have to wait and see if this actually resolves all of the issuesi can agree with that statement however how many accounts do people have without actually using them at the same timeeither way i want to follow the eula as well but i will argue against any eula that restricts my gameplay outside of my bounds of reason ill follow it but that doesnt mean i have to agree with it with that being said the current changes are acceptable if they are explained the main concern for alot of multiboxers is that this will not solve any issues so whats next thats what most are afraid of as am i ccps reputation with taking the ax to an issue that needs surgery is well known and feared with good reason check out my podcast my blog
im personally kinda tired of hearing the if they dont add walking in stations then no one has even a glimmer of an idea what gameplay element should be placed into wis that will work with eveflying in space meeting places is just a tired and kinda pointless version of player housing that doesnt really make sense with the gameplay reality that all your corp mates will be spread daily amongst multiple systems traveling constantly no one wants to put a combat element into wis at least not with actual isk or implants on the line anyway only a tiny portion of the playerbase has any interest at all with npc storylines and trying to bring the npcs to life will cost literal years of work to make happen
so youre both saying that other games have caught up to eve in that theyve said theyre going to do something
 and you have my support thank you for taking the time to write this piecedscan immunity is a shiny idea but it is too shiny and people arent seeing past it to how it will impact on the game
1 the amount of isk paid for mass wardecs is too low for the benefit it gives personally id exponentially grow the cost of wardecs so after about 1015 it costs hundreds of billions a week for the next dec2 ganking is pretty easy and without any real consequences however3 its like what less than half a bil edit its 350m thats pocket changes to completely reverse your sec status bring back the old days where it took painful manual ss grindingthis is a prime example of what is wrong with someone like you going for csm youre so self serving what you want is stuff to make things easier for you wardec corps like yours are a problem because wardecs are too cheap and too easy to run to the point that declaring war against hundreds of tiny corps with no chance of defending themselves is possible and now you want those people who are in those corps to effectively be unable to undock for a week because you think its unfair that they can run awayand i know cue you and your usual minions claiming that i must be getting brutally wardecced on all of my npc alts the truth is that its easy to see a fundamental imbalance as large as the one that dedicated wardec corps have over nonpvp corps from the outside the fact that you cant see or more likely wont admit to seeing it is a testament to your ineptitude
i see your point

hey sugarvery glad to see you continuing to support the player community by running for csmx sugar corbexx and the rest of the csm9 delegates this past year have done an amazing job of communicating with the playerbase and developers maintaining transparency keeping solid and open dialogue and keeping everyone informed of continued progress although they have individually moved to champion their constituency i continue to see them overlap support and participate with one another to great success very excited to see many continue to push forward toward csmxit was also a pleasure to meet with sugar at eve vegas ccp manifest introduced us this past year and her and i spent some time talking about the csm and their methods planning and execution i was absolutely impressed with her drive and ambition as a delegate sugar deserves the highest recommendations for her continued representation as a delegate on csmxbest of luck and if you need anything never hesitate to ask 
they always say sugar is bad for you i think you have proved them wrong as csm 9 you are on my vote list
merry christmas eve
i will be following your campaign with interest do you have an opinion on providing stronger tools to fight back against suicide gankers im only asking because you mentioned high sec pvpfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
gorski you did some solo pvp streaming right and when u streamed u put a small cyno icon to help avoid stream snipingccp tried to make more ppl stream even creating a new ingame twitch support but it didnt work the number of streamers stays very small compared to other mmos eve is one of the weakest in pvp streamingi know a few ppl that are very good at pvp and would like to stream but gave up on it the reasons are that eve is already so hard to find good fights in solo duo trio or small gangs becoz u always find blobs more than anything then to add on top of that the risk of getting stream sniped is just too much hassle they tell me it feels like they are working for ccp when they stream can u relate to that statementwhat do u think if anything can be done to make eve more streaming friendly or is eve just really unrepairable bad for pvp streaming
boo awoxing was a unique eve tradition that often lead to hilarious losses and memorable stories
as far as i ever saw the major point of contention was killing another player in highsec without concord retribution without being in a wardec so now at least one hole has been plugged you want to kill another player in highsec without prior aggression you lose your ship highsec working as intended
wardecs are easy to avoid and suicide ganking requires a gang but little individual skill the kick queue just allows lazy carebears to eliminate a problem without skill or effort
what the csm is is difficult to define the csm isnt really a peer review process though were not peers and we rarely see things in time to review them in any meaningful capacity mynnna is not running this year in his place endie is running the reason im honest both in public and in private about csm matters is because i remember how the csm came to be the csm exists not as a junior game developer consultancy but as a means by which players can make sure we have a voice in legislating the rules of the game according to one ccp employee the csm is a pr tool but thats a sword that cuts both ways as history has shown and savvy csm members recognize this the reality is that ccp is in general in frequent contact with the playerbase and they seek out and listen to many individuals and experts who dont have a csm tag on a superficial level this makes the csm redundant if the only purpose of the institution is to talk to ccp as player representatives on the balance this is a good thing thoughUFFFDsince individual players arent under ndaUFFFDit does sometimes result in some pretty hilarious nda breaches for which the csm sometimes gets wrongly blamed as the other members of csm 9 and ccp would no doubt tell you ive been a firmUFFFDsome might say belligerentUFFFDadvocate for the csm as an institution ive consistently went to the mats with ccp on being cut out of processes our rights to engage as players and the increasing marginalization of the institution as for why its because im convinced that the csm when used properly and populated by capable members is a huge asset to the community and the game as a whole but regardless of what ccp does with the csm the ultimate responsibility is on us as players to make the csm effective and the reality is that were not there yet

what is your take on cloaky afk camping as a tacticpersonally i view it as at best a broken mechanic worst as harassment this being simply because there is no counter to it what might you do to provide a counter to cloaky camping what costs might it have and how would you balance it
heres the thing with cloaky camping its not gameplay pizzapasta rage incoming you have been warnedcloaky camp 0 risk you go to the store you go to work or cook dinner but you dont play eve then you sit down look at the target decide what you need to win and do itneeds contrast and i like the concept of some sort of cyno like beacon for the recon ship class vessels timer based where you can break that cloak throughout the system for as long as that beacon can be fueled just like a cyno i think this allows the afk hunter to be hunted it also makes the cloaky camper have to actually play the game seems this could be a decent balance for the mechanic
if theyre going to sell outfits and stuff then they need an outlet for those items to be shown offportraits only show at most the shoulders of your char all the other stuff youre wearing is hidden from view unless a player clicks view full body and no one really does except the very curious so i support some modicum of wis if only to view how other players look itd also serve as a way for players to meet up and socialise in local instead of everyone just posting to a chat full of isk scamsbut eh for full appreciation of it at the very least we need some advanced camera controls which could be implemented right now at almost no cost a needed tool if were to appreciate all these outfits the default angle of the camera doesnt really let you see things in proper perspective
no offence but there has been a huge number of suggestions for gameplay within stations and derelicts including combat
simply not true if pvpers need something they can simply buy it off the market at fair market prices and be done with it why would a pvp corp pay an indy corp to mine and produce stuff for them when they can get their ships and equipment from the market just as easily and cheaper to boot indy corps do this too dont make the mistake of thinking that just because a corp is indy they produce everything themselveswhen you propose that an indy corp should just hire some help youre effectively saying that on top of being harassed by a pvp corp looking for easy targets the indy corp should also pay for another pvp corp to get some targets and those hired guns arent cheap 200m for what is essentially protection money paying that sum every time some griefer corp wardecs you will quickly drain your wallet not to mention the lulz that ensue when griefer corps find out you pay a good 200 to 400 million to hire protection every single time they dec you for what 50m being the griever corp i would laugh my ass off and dec that same corp over and over and over again just to see them spend the money or better yet work together with whatever merc corp gets hired by the target and share the profit ironically hiring help in eve online is actually counter productive to what you as a target want to accomplish ending the war which is why noone ever does it on paper the assistance mechanic looks interesting but its absolutely useless against griefer corpsanyway the thing that all big and mighty pvpers seem to be missing is that eve online is a video game that people play for their own amusement some entertain themselves with pvp others are more drawn to the industrial side of the game both are fine but you need to understand that you cant force someone to do something they dont want to do pvp players want to shoot stuff but they would rather log off for a week straight than spend more than 2 minutes in a mining ship if given the choiceon the other side industrialist like to mine and produce and would rather log off for a week which they often do leaving no force to fight with in the first place than spend a week flying around in pvp fleets and ultimately getting their asses kicked if they were to try anyway because lets face it most indy pilots have sht pvp skills and have no interest in training them which is subsequently the reason they get decced in the first place because they are easy targets that probably wont shoot back making for easy laughs for the griefer corpwar dec mechanics are currently broken because they are used to grief a corp is wardecced not to spark a fight or to measure who is better but to embarrass a target corp if they dock up and hide the deccer laughs at them and feels good about having disrupted their operations if the targets forms up and fights they tend to get their asses kicked based purely on experience which also makes the deccer laugh and feel good even if they lose because content if the target ignores the war and keeps doing what they are doing they get their mining or mission ships blown up which just about makes the deccer cream their pantsonce again i feel the need to state that war decs should always exist in some form and that the high sec care bears should never be 100 safe but if some huge pvp merc alliance wardecs a small 30 player industrial corp that has absolutely no pvp skills things need to be balanced enough so that the small inexperienced corp has a realistic chance of winning and thus ending the war on their terms not just the terms of the attacker and yes that would still mean that the small target corp would have to go out and fight but they would be able to fight for a purpose instead of just serving as cannon fodder for a weeki wont pretend to know what kind of changes or new mechanics would be fair and balanced to both parties but i do know that the current system is extremely biased towards the attacker which is not a good situation no matter how you want to look at it
btw this is a very interesting discussion
so where do the pvpers get their money to buy that stuff from the marketoh thats right they pve do industry the highmargin stuff or farmharvestvery few pvpers can say that they earn money from pure shiponship violence those that do are more of the exception than the ruletrue most indy corps dont produce everything but they do produce what they feel they will get the most out ofas for pvpers and pveers that attach themselves to each other once you leave the confines of highsec this becomes a lot of common than you thinkpvpers want stuff that they use for cheap stuff on the market usually sells for 5 to 15 higher than the material value more if you are far away from a trade hub indys want potential attackers to be discouraged from attacking in the first place it wont save them if they are caught on a gate but it may help save their posseve is based on the concept that you can affect anyone and everyone for whatever reason even if they do not like iti as a pvper am affected by industrial people and pveers i am forced to spend my money on stuff they buildearn because if i do not i have no way to play the way i want i do not enjoy it i have no means of avoiding this without also getting into industrypveso why should i not be allowed to affect an industry player in a way they dislike as wellat the same time why should industrypve people not have to learn the basics of pvp the same way i have had to learn the basics of indsutrypveoh thats right because no one should be forced to do anythingin that case i propose that all building materials ships mods equipment ammo etc have their prices automatically set to zero or something close enough to that  every time i lose a ship that ship should respawn in my hanger so i do not have to buy anything  i get paid large amounts of isk by concord for every player kill i make that way i do not have to do pve or industryits only fair after all because i do not want to be forced into doing things i do not like to do and industry players take away from that by forcing me to buy their stuff which requires me to perform other activities that i do not enjoy like pvesee what i did there its the same argumentas long as industry forcefully affects me i am allowed to forcefully affect it backso what arbitrary mechanic would you propose to force people who do not want to fight to fight people who want to fightthe issue here is that you are running into the conflict between different human natures that the game is predicated onpeople who want to fight versus people who do not want to fightpeople who produce versus people who want to destroypeople who want to be left alone versus people who want to affect everyonepeople in all of the above points have to find ways to make their side win using the mechanics to their advantageyou cant have idonthavetodoanythingidonotwanttodo mechanics while staying true to the everyone can affect everyone else in any way themeboth concepts are mutually exclusive of the other both literally and in essencethen again it is this conflict that makes the game so interesting
dear eve players and developerswith the up coming eve update the eve community will gain new levels of gaming experience without question but with that said one possible and promising aspect of eve game play might have been over looked by the public though not popular or unknown to many of the eve community the factory work teams have been given the pick slip as a industry focus player i have used work teams with many build projects if possible it is an interesting aspect of eve game play and has given the game it self in my opinion a face of the industrial side of eve though at this moment many of the current work teams are available until their expiration date the idea of shorting or and improving build orders in eve has made the game more interesting and has open the game to many new possible types of gameplay so i ask the eve community to release the work teams to the public if possible that they could be bought as for example as a passenger in the market or contracted in contracts from their current employers that could be rented and transported though space as any market item to work at any station or crop or faction as if possible work teams could have special skill books that focus on higher work team skills in player work projects research or use the player already used or learned skills that might be common to every industrialist that improve work team performance in ether production or research or for extra income work teams could be working for the players as a service for the eve industrial market if possible make it streamline and not making any addition to a players skill queue and make work teams with industrial invention or blueprints that improve work team skills which ever is the case if possible work teams as a wild card could if used in build projects and research with a add twist to the projects of ships equip etc unique to the work team project player standing and many other factors which could add improvements against certain enemy ships or weapons and in research a higher level of tech or unknown out comes that might surprise inventors in positive or negative ways that might increase their use or for the extreme a player standing with a bought  rented work team that has a poor standing with the player or corp in which the projects are now are at risk from sabotage that might cause differences in timecost or with small negative aspects during times of combat with the sabotage work team corp or allies that might tip combat and or game play faction  corp  player work teams working in opposing faction space doing the same as an focus team working to sabotage a specific type of enemy faction ship you might want to weaken against your warship  corp  faction or other areas of interest which ever the reason work teams can operate in eve if any or possible a future with work teams could ripple threw out the eve community and game thank you for any replays neg or pos any feedback any interest that might get a conversation going about work teams i would think if work teams have a future to stay in eve is that at least a special item be made for the mass firing of the eve work teams made available so at least a few can rememberjokeugh even thought if what is written here the ideas for work teams noted or seen by any or none this was an attempt to save the man in the machinethank you eve community
i see santa brought you a great wall of text and you saw fit to share merry christmasdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
weve been posting the soundboards here andor in their relevant subsections tweeting them making blog posts etc the over all plan is to get it organized so that the announcements are at least here when they crop up the entire soundboard is rather new started by corbexx and now expanded as we are seeing positive feedback and productivity from themwe are going to try to get another structure one in before the summit so i expect sometime in the next two weeksas for other ideas toss them out here in the soundboard threads to the csm member you feel will speak for you features and ideas there are many pathsas for why cant there be sites that do x y and z because the current site code and npc ai is not intelligent enough for that but there is a hopeful future and that is a question i will ask to see if such things are in that future
first of all thanks for the question and merry christmasi strongly believe that pvp in all its many forms consensual and non consensual have a place in this game its what makes this game pretty much unique having said that im all for the idea of giving people more chances to fight back because that encourages interaction and there are a number open to them as it stands neutral rr boosts etc so maybe its just the case that people need to be made more aware of the options open to them sitting ducks are no real fun to shootthere are some changes i would like to see i would like to make more of the bounty hunting  kill right system which is at the moment not fit for purpose at least the way players use it there are plenty of things you could do in particular with the bounty system that could make it more cat and mouse than it is as well as this you could look at extending kill rights duration or possibly extending kill rights to be available for more than a one time thing or make it proportional to the value destroyed as an examplei would like to encourage group activities and fleets escorting high value targets and giving them ways to interact and interfere because its all encouraging engagement in the game and makes the game more challenging and satisfyinghope this answers your questionk
yes i do indeed stream at twitchtvhkarn when i was in pandemic legion i put a badly photoshopainted image of a cyno as overlay it was mostly as a joke i streamed without any delay or anything blocking my screen i actually very rarely got streamsniped  i would welcome it most of the time since its a fight at least i understand that streaming sometimes can get a bit frustrating in a intel intensive game as eve but its your own choice some like it some dont i think eve is decent for pvp streams there are a couple of semi big ones and ppl can have success doing itand jimmy jamsaldap thanks for your support i actually sold my link alt recently and i would love ccp to support movie makers more but there is also stuff you players can do in form of rewards think one man crew or sponsorships
i never said you shouldnt be able to affect people hell i never even said that wardecs are a bad thing just that the way they currently work is bad because the attacker gets to basically set all the rules and duration and the defender is at their mercythe defender has absolutely no way to end the war on their terms the only way it can end is if the attacker decides theyve had enough which when purposely fighting targets that dont have the experience skillpoints money or numbers to fight back is pretty damn unfair fights and the metagame do not have to be fair because eve being eve if youre in a fair fight someone made a mistake which is true but the game mechanics that make those fights possible aka wardec mechanics should be fair this is still a video game after all so if the attacker has a way to end the war on their terms so should the defenderstrue players who dont want to fight wont ever undock and fight no matter the mechanics but within my own corp at least theres not so much a sense of not wanting to fight but rather not seeing the point in doing so after all fighting back is what the enemy wants and pleasing them is the last thing anyone wants to dohowever if you were to give players a purpose to undock and fight like being able to end the war early or some other useful bonus then most of the people in my corp would most certainly try to give it a shot why because then theyd be fighting and working towards a goallike i said i have no clue about the sort of mechanics that should be involved many ideas have been posted over the years from objectives to kill quotas capturing structures you name it i honestly wouldnt know what the best way to go about it is ill leave that in the capable hands of ccp seagull and her infinite wisdom all i know is that what we currently have is pretty shtty
got to admit that this rings true it is a shame because there should be good and enticing options available for all types of play i never understood the war dec mechanic in isolation of a reciprocal option perhaps to bribe concord to kick them out of highsec for a while
again the whole thread is going off topic with regards to what my alliances issue is and that of the newer start up corporationswars are not a bad thingeve needs that as an option issue is the option atm is abused to circumvent a concord responsemake the mechanic of war mean something and then the industrialist will have reason to fightatm only motivation to fight is the warm feeling of getting one over the aggressor which isnt why many of us play evehave it cost something to declare warbuild in a risk verse reward for both sidesmake the results mean something currently a clean slate means nothing and is seen as a win for the defender 50 noob ships counts as 50 solid killsmaybe track and rank the effectiveness of wars against others a high ranking merc corp verse a indi corp loses rank indi v indi  pvp v pvphigher rewardsim sure there are far more inventive and creative means to make a war worth fighting and make spamming war decs to cast a wide net for a few kills pointless
is there a more inventive means if you have one please put it forththe reality is that eve is a competitive sandbox where everyones actions both combat and industrial can affect everyone else therefore there needs to be mechanisms where players can disrupt the activities of other players especially large organized groups of other players wardecs are one of the few ways to do this in highsec and as such need to be in the game in some formyou seem though to have an issue with the concept of risk vs reward this idea doesnt mean that each player has to be at the same risk  that an aggressor has to be at the same risk as a defender for example in fact the actual wardec mechanics are heavily biased in favour of the defender it means that if you are engaging in an iskmaking enterprise then you are the one that has to be at risk ideally the greater amount of isk you are trying to make the greater the risk should be to you if your opponent is not trying to make iskresources why should they be at equal risk to you if it is you that will get all the rewardwhat is needed is a way for players to tune the amount of risk and reward that they want to expose themselves to if you are a small corp say just running missions with a few friends you should be at much less risk than a large industrial corp trying to put billions of iskmonth of goods into the economy one way to do this is to have optin mechanisms similar to the current pocos that were mentioned that increase the income reward of a corp but make the corp vulnerable to attack there should be similar deployables for mining industry missioning etc that increase corp income and are moderately tough to install and expensive but are not able to be taken down in the event of a wardec like pocos this way corps can decide to earn the reward of using them in exchange for the risk that they might be attacked and this would motivate those attacked to defend their assets also i think there should be a social tier of corps that can opt out of wardecs and intracorp aggression completely they would have no benefits of the current corps no taxes poses or the like but would allow casual players to play the game albeit with less rewards than a true corp that is taking responsibility for defending themselves against other corporations
well i kinda like this oneso farthere must be hundred of optionsto make the whole point of wars and well even corporations worth while
there is already an optout mechanism for avoiding wardecs its the npc corps players who want to not be wardecced can simply and automatically move into an npc corp and never be wardecced again now i know this will not satisfy the op and his supporters they want their poss their pocos the taxes of their poor underlings pouring into their coffers they want to make a name for themselves and eventually move into nullsec as countless highsec corporation descriptions have read since eve began but that is a misunderstanding of the nature of this game if you cant protect your organization and the people in it your corp has no right to exist the pvpers are culling out the weak they are showing the leadership and membership of those corps what the reality of their organization is that they are weak associations of players with no group loyalty whos main purpose in joining said group is to profit individually off the labors of the others since by admission of their leaders they get no protection and as miners and other pveers provide no protection in return there is no other reason for them to be there as always they are there because they think they will be paid for it in some fashion the membership of pvp organizations will fight for each other the members of pve corps only stay as long as they profit and if called to make a sacrifice will bolt at the first opportunity for the health of the game these corps must be destroyed the individual pveers fill a useful niche as the bottom of the food chain so they can stay but their leave us alone corps no by choosing to mine in new order systems highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct wwwminerbumpingcom

have to love this community
corbexx was a fierce advocate for wormholes on csm9 and hell do a great job on csm 10 as well
definite endorsement from me and mine 
i have asked many of them in person i would hope they would be willing to comment in public as well but they have not done so as of yet statements like i dont feel the need to comment on your fellow csm members are very worrisome to me the people on the csm with you have the best idea of how effective you have been throughout your term if you look at the threads of the other members running for reelection you will see many comments from fellow csm members if you look in this thread you see none perhaps you should be asking your fellow members why they are not willing to endorse you perhaps your potential voters should be asking those other members why as wellcsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
sugar is the hardest worker in my mind on csm9 she delivers reelection for a spot on csm 10
you have been fantastic thus far so count me in for an enthusiastic vote
best of luck manny do better than i didwhich isnt hard haha
ive spoken to june many times at the boston eve meets though she has been slacking and hasnt shown up at the last couple and i think she would do a great job on the csm she is very knowledgeable on game mechanics and she has a real passion for helping new players that is super important to the future of eve and ccpcsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog
sions a good man you should definitely have him on your list
psianh is a cool dude i spent a while chatting with him irl last ff he is smart and knows game mechanics it is very important to make sure that csm 10 has broad representation from all types of players and having someone who knows the mercenary business is super useful he will certainly be on my ballot and he should be on yours as wellalso his gf is awesome as long as she hasnt broken up with him yet if so she suckscsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter
yeah npc corps are an option if want to forgo the idea of being and creating a corp identity  kinda why many make a corp on first place then find themselves permanently in warsif actually took time to read the op you will see it states deployment of pocos would mean you opt out of any kind of concord support or opt into war dec  same should apply if you decide to put towers upas for saying loyalty is about isk your way off the mark most of our veteran nearing 8 years in one case are pve pilots
but not just npc corps you can also avoid war decs in player corps it just takes a little more work in some casesit really boils down to this if you want to avoid consequences then that comes at a priceeve is pvp centric even though you like to look at some pilots as 8 years pve veterans they are actually 8 year pvp ones i guarantee that they have done pvp for the vast majority of those yearscertain wars may not mean much to you but they may mean a lot more to those making them but it is up to you to try and make them mean nothing its all well and good running to the forum looking for hand holding but how about some corp action to make them wish they hadnt bothered decing you this doesnt necessarily mean all jumping in ships and fighting it means thinking outside the box and doing what eve players are good at screwing over other players so screw them over cost them isk make them regret messing with youthe beauty with eve is the fact that we can affect each and every other player in the game to some degree no one should get special treatment against that aspect including those that think they are pve only when in fact they are mistakenare war decs broken damn straight they are they are too damn easy to avoiddestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i dont look at them as year pve veterans they are pve player they dont pvp some relocate and work around the war others stay docked till its overunless your in npc then they are unavoidablethe impact of a war dec is easy to avoidbut not the war dec
they do pvp they are pvp veterans pvp is not exclusively ship to ship combat and almost every aspect of eve is pvp even ship spinningas much as you wish eve to have a pve only environment its not going to happen you could always play on sisi its the nearest to what you are afterwar decs are easy to avoid you just have to work at it a little or you can fight back this is also not exclusively ship to ship combatdestination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i read the op again to make sure i didnt misunderstand anything i didnt it was just another one more nerf please request from the carebear community to ccp based on the illusion of highsec safety let me ask a few questions about your successful alliance and its 8 year veterans 1 when wardecced do you immediately contact the aggressor and offer to surrender and meet their terms thus possibly avoiding a week or more of corp activity disruption 2 do you access the seriousness of the threat scout the enemies locations and numbers analyze their killboard 3 do you contact your entire membership with a plan for winning the war even if winning means just surviving without heavy losses or do you just tell everyone to dock up 4 do you make sure you and your membership have no obvious weak points at which to be attacked do you put your pos defenses online do you move fuel ships and ammunition into position to ride out an interdiction 5 do you have standing agreements with other like minded alliances to join your wars as allies do you ally with other alliances who have been wardecced to help them out in their time of need 6 do you set traps that appear to be unprotected mining or mission runner activities but are really well protected and overpowering forces ready to snap up an inprudent attacker or do you ask ccp to do the work for you eve allows you to play in perfect safety just dont undock but if you choose to come out of station then you have to realize that there is someone waiting to kill you burn your ships destroy your corp and laugh at your outraged cries corp identity means nothing if its not based on protecting the corp your wealth means nothing if its just sitting in your wallet and not invested in the tools necessary to keep your organization in one piece maybe they should just make it much more difficult to form a corp or alliance so only people capable of leading them are able to push that button the bottom line is this many if not most highsec corps and alliances do not deserve to survive if a wardec pushes it into a failure cascade it was too flawed to exist most highsec ceos do significant damage to their members especially the new players through a combination of bad information self serving direction of corp assets and just plain ruining the fun of playing the game really dock up for a week is good advice pvpers blast those corps apart expose the inadequacies of the leadership and believe it or not convince a not insignificant fraction of the new players that pvp is not only fun but available to them right away we just have to pry them out of the grasping hands of their carebear leaders by choosing to mine in new order systems highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct wwwminerbumpingcom
serious questiondo you hate babies like sabriz doesor do you understand that babies never ever cry and scream for nogood reason and simply have no other way of communicating their needs and problemsi am definitely not going to vote for a human being that is so low and hatefull as to think thatbabies scream for no other reason than just sothanks
thanks for the upswags
as someone who also spend a large amount of time training new players i am very interested in some of your ideas i have repeatedly heard the argument that awoxing affects new players but in my year of experience recruiting newbros to a variety of corps i have yet to recruit someone who has actually awoxed a member of my corp or organization what percentage of applicants are you encountering that have malicious intent and actually make this an issue obviously im just asking for a rough estimate but im trying to figure out why people see this as such as issue for new players my experience is that corps that recruit new players are targeted but the new players in the said corps almost never are have you found something differentalso do you have any opinions on the state of wspace currentlyfounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
correct me if i am wrong but isnt this how many corps especially with significant assets handle new members in wh null and perhaps low security space why should the good highsec corps with significant assets be any different i am all for improvements to corp and pos management that would allow allow better granularity of control and simpler to help integrate newer members into a corp more readily but the issues with trusting new members exists in all spaces and will still exist in highsec even if intracorp aggression is removed from the game
could you please expand on your thoughts on upcoming changes its hard to support someone on corp history alonefounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
they specifically exist to circumvent the loathsome presence of concord there is an answer to making wars worth somethingand that answer is not to screw over pvp players like youre trying to doits to make player corps worth defending to do that you have to take away a lot from npc corps which are too attractive in comparisonthere already is one you get to shoot back for free if you choose not to then its your fault that your opponent has no risk your risk aversions consequences are not the fault of the game mechanicswhy should peoples desire to find people to kill be made pointless their playstyle deserves to exist as much as yours does moreso since theyre actually interacting with other players
all of the above except 1 as 99 of the time its some bullst reason for the war and the terms are ridiculouseven after all that preparation no war targets turn up as theyre hanging on the undock in jitahaving done the above week in week out some we fight others we dontusually the same corporations who dock up when we field a fleet just what is the pointmake it that the aggressor has to bring a fight and that its worth the indi guys fighting atm theres no incentive but tears which the indi  pve pilots just avoid by ship spinning or playing altsnice speech added nothing to the argument but nice rant
whether i do or do not wont change my ability as a csm nor should it reflect on sabriz overly much however to answer crying takes effort and that requires motivation attention food discomfort for examplesnow onto a topick everyone lovescloakswe can see when structures are going online right across the system sov holders needs a structure they can online and wipes out all cloaks for a given timegive plenty of warning to cloakers to log off or run a way to annoy them as much as they bug usedit can even announce it in local decloaker coming online in xx minutes
do you condone this sort of stuff
feel free to contact me about any ideas or thoughts you might have the messages have been nice to see thank you all for the support sofaraze
i really like that idea combat recon bonus to cloaky jammer makes it vulnerable makes the cloaky vulnerable if he is active cloaky has a fair shot at killing a recon if not he can be probed outits fair and balanced
 1 now this a pvp barrier
i disagree there are still battle reports coming out still violence being done it does put up a barrier against a specific type of pvp the hotdrop of redonculous proportions where bored super pilots hit a miner with dreadnaughts but a barrier making null peace and sunshine and lollipop wielding carebearsnuh uhmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
i think it impacts the player that does not have 45 accounts accounts when you live in a region and have to travel from isk hunting grounds to join fleets reduces speed of form ups ect ect
perhaps this is more about how many blues you have chosen to surround yourself with
if i live on a mountain i should not complain about the lack of waterfront propertyif you live deep within a blue part of space you cannot complain that we have removed the easy button of cross galaxy teleportation and you now have to commute or even move to where the action is you cannot be both safe and a threatbut as has been said before and i will probably say a lot more often this is one step in a process you are complaining you cannot live in a house that does not even have walls yet give ccp the time to make all the changes i will still be here to listen to you comment compliment or complain but i am looking at the long game not how things are perceived to be in the short runno more than i complain that a house is drafty when they still havent installed the roof or windows mmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
so you agree theyre just used to engage in high sec to avoid the criminal system no other purpose or objectivewhy are we screwing the pvper over it would be making the war more active moreso if the indi corps and pve corps where able to actually get on with what they prefer to doyour ships ammomods everrthing would become cheapermaking pvp more affordableplus your pve mains could go about their business toomost high sec pvpers we encounter dont pvp they just gank solo miners  haulers etc turn out a fleet and they dock and jump back to a trade hubmaybe thats an answer remove npc corp optionsbut how do you make a player corp worth fighting for currently most effective way to end a war is not log in how can that be rightagain why shoot back its partly what the purpose of declaring war in high sec is aboutto get fights theres nothing to motivate the indipve pilot to do sothe suggestions make the kills have a purpose moreso by the war actually being about an objective a true victory with some means of reward each kill or defense means something 
what are you talking about that is the purpose to get rid of concord in a specific engagementfirst of all i do not have a pve main because i have some self respectsecondly putting handcuffs and conditions on being able to declare war is unacceptable you do not get to lobby to curtail other peoples freedom as players just because youre unable to deal with them in the gamethirdly ganking miners and haulers is pvp by definition you do not get to derogate and disqualify an activity just to fit your agendathe most effective way to end a war is to dec dodge and that isnt right but to answer your question to make player corps worth fighting for player corps should be made the only path available for optimal gameplay npc corps should carry enough penalties for any character older than 30 days that to remain in one is not economically viablethat by itself makes a player corp something valuable something worth defendingsee the above if they are economically hampered by not being in a player corp then they have something to defend you say that but what you really want is to put conditions on my actions taking away my player freedom to benefit yourself i see what your true objective is and its certainly not game balance
this so much this its what all these types of threads are abouti dislike many other activities in eve such as mining industry markets etc people are constantly beating me at pvp in those areas sure i make a bit of isk now and then in the market but no where near as much as many othersshould i complain to ccp and ask for changes to those fields so i can compete or should i look for other ways to avoid heavy losses that may require a little more workwell it will not be the former simply because i know the game is pvp centric all players compete in everything in the game just because im not good at a certain aspects of the game doesnt give me the right to ask for those parts to be nerfed in my favourso like i said you and they see themselves as 8 year pve veterans but i guarantee they are 8 year pvp ones destination skillqueue its like assuming the lions will ignore you in the savannah if youre small fat and look helpless
i must say isnt it the miners and builders that make the pvp shipsstart a cartel and raise the prices of them ships they use to kill you in drastically more expensive in certain areas make them pay for there modules
i dont see removing awoxing a barrier for pvp it will just make pvpers have a bit if organisation about them actually show there skills  i would not call awoxing and war decing people who cant defend them selves pvp to be honestcome to 00 lets get wrecked
with talks about destructible stations on the cards in the near future and eve online declaring that its likes the real world aspect in the game player driven economyit seems null will have to become a self driven place i would like to see that if an alliance takes a station they own that station and should be able to reclaim all the assets in that station that does not belong to the alliancewouldnt that be sweet would be a lot better for every one involved would truly make null the ultimate placebecause i just see the destructible stations as a huge money stint if ccp just said yeah now you can destroy them there has to be more though in the process obviously as it is a subscription based game and people would get upset if there 110 years playing went up in smoke would create many tearsi would like to see many views on this i was just thinking out aloud but would like to see other views and ideas around thisregardsminnie
as sugar has said the recordings normally get posted in the orginal threads and also on blogs as well as us tweeting them we might be able to sort a site for them to all be put up in one convenient placeyeah there is always some circular talk its one of the things thats hard to not have when you have people from different areas of the game with different views we try to move stuff on its still in the early stages so a work in progress
i dont really mind you stealing my catch phrase as it cannot be said often enough although an attribution would be nice for my publicity loving self however i do object to you following it with a sentiment that is the exact opposite of what it means fight back do something to win the conflict between you and your enemies think about what he has and what you have and turn the odds in your favor if you wont fight then you deserve what is done to you we in the new order and our supporters are fighting for highsec fighting against those who would ruin it make it into a safe quiet uninteresting isk faucet those like you your campaign boils down to destroy highsec aggression like thousands before you you only claim to want to make it even just a little more balanced just one more nerf and unfortunately highsec has received these nerfs but the carebears keep dying and so here you are asking for more because the carebears will never accept less than total safety its a desparate battle for the soul of the game after enormous setbacks we are finally turning the corner highsec will be saved even if we have to kill every carebear to do itbing bangboomagent of the new order of highsecbelligerent undesirable by choosing to mine in new order systems highsec miners have agreed to follow the new halaima code of conduct wwwminerbumpingcom
i am not even sure why you would start your campaign with something like this seriously when i read this i immediately have some ideas and question about how to game this to our advantage this reads like one of this seriously broken ideas that pop up every other hour in the fi forumit also shows that this is not really your field of expertise if you want to improve something in the game then it would probably be a good idea to stick to the game mechanics you actually know something aboutalso i dont think it is your job as a csm to do game design but to provide feedback to ccp about their game designs if you dont even get that you may be the wrong person for the job entirely
i am not doing any game design i get feedback from the community like the hideout idea which i do like and i post it to see the responses you responded thank you 1
torai could ask you via other channels but im doing it here because i know your stance like in many other cases will be awesome since you aim to keep eve from turning into a nerfed disneyland what is your opinion on the heavy handed forum administration thats been killing some previously vibrant official subforumsa latest example open for you reactiond

easily top 3 on my listgood luck manny p sure youll get enough backing thoughmy question any ideas on how to pull nontier3 battlecruisers out of the dumpster balancewisejust leaving these two here because i think theyre maybe worth a lookprom has an idea which i think has some merit where youd rebalance mjd functionality to be a script for regular mwd only loadable if youre in a ship type that can use mjd so bcs would not have to use an extra slot and fitting resources to get mjd functionality
the problem is t3s are better than everything in the current meta so looking at bcs and lol command ships is pointless because when ccp nerfed nanos years ago they made it so signature radius was everythingbombers are the problem to tier 3 bcs and most sniper platforms well in fact pretty much every concept is plagued by bombers what ccp fails to understand is that a few things way out of balance cast ripples through the rest of the game combat probing  it is so hilariously easy anyone with the most basic skills can probe and get a warp to 0 result on a hostile fleet every 10 seconds this automatically hampers fleet tactics bombers  the literal cancer of nullsec pvp cripples doctrine choicestl  dr  the word battle does not belong in battlecruiser in its current form its more like lolgethazednerdcruisergetarealship

i dont think either jen or sabriz have any issue in dealing with newer folk who are eager to learn any baby labeling is likely to be pointing out that a person is being difficult to work with but this is a forum post about jenshae chiroptera not sabriz adoudel

1 i think your negative voting analysis is flawed i see it as a tool that has the potential to be used by bigger blocks to exert more control over the csm i am willing to wager that 90 of the down votes on reddit are from people who do not have an active eve online account reddit being the closest system i can imagine to the one you are proposing2 if a player chooses to load racial bs 1 into a skill queue and then go and play gta or minecraft until the skill is learned in game making the skill queue longer or deeper will not help them providing more in game information on how ships can be used and their weaknesses and strengths to new players will be more beneficial than inserting extra time sinks3 i dont think alpha is major problem in large scale fleet fights fcs like alpha because it is a counter to logistics that can be used by the vast majority of pilots where as jamming damping etc are more specialised roles thus forming a fleet of 250 takes much less time if the doctrines used are cookie cutter simple nerfing alpha will mean a shift in the blob that creates a new op that suits the blob4 your logistics absorb module has ramifications for high security space that i do not think you have thought about 5 wormholes were designed as a niche entity  creating more and creating ones specifically for frigates will help create new niches i think the frig holes are a counter to unscannable recons the change allows easier hunting of loot piUFFFDatas while providing a safer option for wh newbies6 i believe your assumptions regarding ganking are incorrect ganking has become harder over the last 5 years with insurance removal concord changes while mining ships and haulers have received buffs that enable a competent pilot a greater ability to influence the outcome of any conflict 7 i am not sure why clocking needs changing how is it broken
1 it is two fold need announcements as local motd and on the launcher of the possibility only way to really know is to try it2 having some skill requirements such as for t2 tank modules would give them more of an indictator and if they are playing actively by them more time to learn3 check fleet compositions note how in the news whole wings and fleets of ewar are blown away4 i have written in various places about fleet mechanics and coalitions being recognised in the mechanics5 worm holes werent even meant to be settled the strength was that you could stick a growing corp  alliance in there as an incubator control access and grow now you cant keep the scanning ships out so all the small entities have no hope6 look at a kill board7 afk hot droppers

about the exudos in whs is because the profits despite great does not cover a single loss you will have that in many cases is all that possessed infraestructure
effort and training    i and a lot of the incursion folks i have talked with would love to see incursions get a make over more variance updated etc as for balance    how would you suggest we compare them to l4s or mining one cannot afk an incursion one cannot solo an incursion a newish player with low sp will need the support of a lot of other people with more skills to survive an incursion so should incursion income be on par with l4s noi would love for scout sites to be redone    heavily redone to give newer small groups a taste of what is to come just as l1s slowly build to l2s and so onas for lowsec hell yes that needs a buff to income to balance out the same level of training as needed in high along with increased risk and the shift to t1 fits and less blingy ships which slows down the income rate i also would like to see some mechanism that keeps the movement of the lowsec incursions from being so large from one to the next as they have a much harder time doing the migration after an incursion closesyou never specified what your issue with incursions is i presume it is that they make too much isk for too little effortif so do you also think that we should take a serious look at other income streams that exceed that income and are shown to also be relatively low risk
hi mikewhat are your thoughts about riskfree looting of yellow wrecks in highsec by laundering the loot using a fleet hangar are you okay with this and if so why if not would you try to push for a changein case you donUFFFDt know what iUFFFDm talking about it works like this gankers gank a haulerfreighter and the resulting wreck is of course yellow to loot the wreck riskfree they use 2 characters the first one sits in a ship with a fleet hangar deep space transport or orca the second one can be an alt without any skills in a noobship both warp to the yellow wreck and the char in the noobship loots the stuff from the yellow wreck by putting it directly into the fleet hangar the result is that the noobship goes suspect the dstorca however does not and can warp off safely carrying the loot given the size of the fleet hangar of a dst even ships up to bs size can be looted without any additional risk compared to a blue wreckthankssarah
this is funny so obvious once it is pointed out the easiest would be to make someone under the criminal flag unable to transfer good in or out of a hold but then that would hit the guys who refit on the fly with mobile depotsout of curiosity what would you have happen make the possession of the looted goods a yellow offense or make transfer of the same impossible gold does no crimes has no guilt does anyone ever gank the orca that holds the stolen goods or is the immediate presence of concord make that an impossibilityon the larger side    i think that crimewatchbountieswardecs and all associated with it are about due for a reexamination this is the hisec equivalent of sov after all it is the rules hisec lives and dies bythis one does go in my book i keep a book of things to ask ccp but i have no idea if it will get much tractionmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD
my issue is not too much isk for too little effort but more for too little risk especially with the complete lack of randomness in incursion spawns the only real risk to a player in a good incursion group is the slight risk of ganking and probably the more real risk of falling asleepi do think the reward is far too high and especially because unlike just about any other high reward activity wormholes exploration whatever incursions dont suffer from any scarcity if one wants to they could pretty much run incursions 2357 unless the incursion folks are having an argument again and prematurely finishing the incursions they are also very onedimensional unlike in wspace where one has to scan pvp fuel poses people can really specialize in incursion running and just do that they dont even need to haul loot out just stop over in a hub for ammo every now and thenand yeah any other source of income that is high reward and low risk should be looked at very closely if that hits wspace fine i dont think you can really make the argument that it is low risk thoughcsm 7 secretary csm 6 alternate delegate twostepeve on twitter my blog

thank you
see its this sort of stuff that makes me feel like you dont actually know what you are talking about when you sit outside of a pos shield your ship itself is at risk you can be bumped or even another ship can wedge between you giving enough time for a sufficient group to get into system to kill you a sensible titan pilot can neut out a hictor that doesnt sit outside 30km and warp off or jump or more importantly he can not throw himself into situations that he is wide open to be caught on his own like any other ship his best defence is common sense just like how all it takes to permanently pin down any supercarrier is 2 hictors they cant clear them no problem if there is more than 1 because you cant directly ecm burst a hictor it tries to jam everyone except the target you fire at and you assign your fighters to one he warps a short distance then comes back and your fighters are off in that stupid warp schenanigans for ages meanwhile the other hictor has you pointed which you cannot ecm burst or you could split 5 fighters on each and not take either one down quickly the reason that carriers and supercarriers get used so much is the way that their capital remote assistance modules make the fleet exponentially more powerful by attempting to defang supers by lowering their drone tracking etc you ignore the real issue leaving them as giant triage units that create invincible tanks not to mention tracking is meaningless when fleets have lokis or rapiers on grid stuff is webbed and painted to where titan guns can hit a battleship with ease but you know this right youre in pl afterall as for making fighters affected by warp bubbles it would be interesting but i wonder how difficult it would be for ccp to code it every once in a while there is someone asking for fighters and fb to be affected by warp disruptorsscramblersas for csm accessibility why not follow sugar kyle and corbexxs lead and actually do so make yourself available and accessible to hear the views of others to help put forward what the community wants by listening to the community have a public chat channel where people can reach you most of the playerbase hates the forums or hates posting on themavoids themtreats them like they dont exist but ingame people will mail you or hop into a channel and talk really at this point your campaign comes across as we need to force players to care about the csm so that i can make these changes that i want happen as for the whole age schenanigans itll be interesting to see how ccp rules though i think eve has a lot less potential for voting in 14 year olds that would turn the csm into a farce that quickly loses any of the respect that they have been working hard to gain over the past couple years going back to the supercarriers issue for a moment i think that looking at the resists of supers would be a far more sensible solution supers should have a ton of hp yes but they should not have exponential tanks with the presence of more and more supers on grid how do we address this nerfing super blobs but not individual supers kill their resists i cant remember his name that guy with the solo phoenix pvp videos made an excellent post talking about how if supercapital ehp was all shifted into actual armor and shield or structure hitpoints with their resists being nuked they would still take just as long to kill in small gangs but wouldnt become nearly unkillable in giant superslowcat gangs all the negativity aside i wish you luck with your campaign the csm is a huge time investment for those who take the job seriously and its admirable that you show the interest to do so

everybody will have their own way to fix issues in the end i just answerd to the question with my opinion which remains that assigning fighters whos tracking is horrific op atm is just to safe atm yes you can be bumped off but even me being in pl will admit saying that if something on a pos shield then it becomes 100 times harder to succesfully kill also why should a ship being able to fight without being on field itselfthe reason why capital rr and such is to powerfull is become its so much better then the other logi ships a solution would by my idea for the role of logistics have it so that every ship size frigates tm battleships have a t2 logistics variant that support their ship size so cruiser logi for cruiser fleets and bs logi for bs fleets doing this will make a ladder system and so the capital mods will be less outsized then it is now im currently still on vacation will sit down and look at your ehp thing when i get homei will be writing a full idea list on en24 later and then i will find the best way to get in touch with people create a ingame channel or so everybody is welcome ofcourse to send me a mail at bobmonevegmailcom  bobmon ingame  twitter and ofcourse you can convo me
 posterbut good man glad youre running again one of my top candidates for sure
this is a pretty broad question so if i leave something out that youre interested in talking about in more depth just let me knowive always been an optimist even when it concerns eve so im very much looking forward to the upcoming changes i think were getting some solid improvements and some interesting tweaks recons  im interested to see how this is going to play out with the shorter release cycles if the dscan change doesnt provide fun and engaging gameplay id sincerely hope that its removed similarly to teams i am happy to see the pilgrim get a little love tech three destroyers  again this is going to be an interesting area to keep an eye on but im happy that ccp is taking a step into totally new directions  and how often have you seen threads about creating new destroyers sovereignty  mostly im ecstatic that corporations and alliances are being worked on i doubt well have a perfect system in the first pass but its imperative that ccp sprinkle in quality of life changes that make the game easier to play without making the game necessarily easier in all eve is in a very pivotal period in its history the game has perhaps never been better from a potential standpoint and its important that we continue to push ccp towards the vision that supports exciting dynamic and fun gameplay a small part of me does fear that ccp may try to cut a few corners especially when it comes to the major gameplay elements of sovereignty and poses but the effort theyre putting into gathering player feedback on these subjects does seem to herald a bright futureif we make sure progress continues
i love the new asset search windows which can now search through containerssomething i would love would be the ability to search through my assets that are in poss in addition to just what i have in stations do you plan to address assets and posses as csm suzy rc mudstone
itt massive amounts of not getting the pointthe point slowing down any entities ability to move large masses of forces over long distances in a timeframe that directly inhibits the aggressing parties ability to cause reasonable damage before defenders arrivethe reason because leaving space assets undefended or underdefended should have penalties the previous mode of gameplay allowed a given capital to travel from one side of the eve cluster to the other in 12 minutes regional defence as a concept was a total joke because any act of aggression would be met with almost immediate retaliationthe solution and why it works the solution we received was to slow down how defending forces respond to an attack if a given front was understaffed by defence forces then flanking actions could be utilised to divide the enemy and conquer them as smaller partitions of their larger force the game under the new model changed from being a superhotdrop disco to requiring a much more indepth degree of strategy and tactics this is why major null groups withdrew from their greater borders so quickly because they knew that strategically the amount of space they controlled was undefendable and that tactically they would need to station their forces more locally to their income generating sources in order to defend them properlyi cant believe this basic idea still needs to be spelt out for people if youve failed to grasp this idea and make it work then it shows that your institution suffers from very weak planning you clearly are living in an environment that is more complex than the organisms within it ie you
a succint explaination of the reason for the long distance travel changes
did not read all butflashes 105 year vet badgeback in my day we had to go 15km to the gate before we could jump both ways in the midst of gate campsand we never heard of this thing called a jb you kids have it easyremove jbhtfu1
now a more serious replyas already stated jump fatigue is just stage one of changes we dont fully know what all of them will be or how they will effect whats going on if for example ccp does no sov at all that you dont claim anything then this changes all game play fully if they do occupational type sov and make it so you can produce things locally with easy then this will have another effectwhat you are doing is you have your face pressed right up to the glass of one of them murual type pictures the picture that is made up of smaller pictures looking at a single picture going wow this sucks why would anyone pay for this pos where as when ccp starts telling you what is coming that will most likely be like someone comes up to you and goes dude take like 6 steps back and then look now you will see the whole and go oh now i get it you could still yea yea but thats still crap but i get the ideathats the issue jump fatigue is not going to go away its part of a whole and as the whole picture starts to take shape ccp might modify jump fatigue till it fits into the large picture stop playing eve like its a day game and look at it in concepts of years and you will shrug off jump fatigue as until you see the whole thing you cant really judgealso use gates or there are these awesome things that came out in 09 called wormholes you prolly have one a few jumps form you right now and it might lead you to 3 from jita in 2 jumps and cost you no jump fatigue who would of thought
please stop pretending you somehow have the right to player freedom because like freedom of speech if you have that right so does everyone else turning that around war deccers are taking away the player freedom of those who do no enjoy pvp to benefit those who do enjoy itthis is an endless loop of biased opinions going round and round the pvpers like the current mechanics because it gives them easy targets the nonpvpers hate the current mechanics because theyre essentially being griefed to sht over and over without any means of properly defending themselves with the added note that no fighting back does not equal defendingbut if you want to pull the player freedom card fine if the attackers can have the player freedom to declare a random indy corp their btch for a week then the defenders should have the player freedom to say fck you go bother someone else and slam the door shut in their face if the defenders manage to achieve some sort of quota objective however you want to go about it the war ends period if the attackers want to prevent that from happening theyll have to do more than play station games the moment a serious threat undocksthat is balanced gameplay and gives both sides the player freedom you want so badly
you seem to have the alltoocomon misperception that there this game has pvp and nonpvp in it this is wrong everything is pvp  eve is purported to come from everyone vs everyone practically everything you do is in competetion with other players not just direct shiptoship combat you are playing in a competetive sandbox where your actions affect me and everyone else and therefore everyone else needs to be able to affect your gameplaywhat you are asking is akin to showing up to a baseball game and telling the umpire that your team only wants to bat so you can score runs but not to take the field because you dont enjoy that play style eve has a set of rules that include you being attacked by wardec messed with stolen from suicide ganked your profits market pvped away your asteroids mined out from under you and numerous other ways that players can compete for power and resources you do not get to isolate yourself from the sandbox because you deem yourself a nonpvperpractically all the forms of competetion in this game are nonconsensual in the sense you dont get to prearrange your fights be them industrial production the race for pve sites market pvp or a lowsec roam wardecs are valid way to engage with other players and can happen because of competetion for markets or asteroidice belts because someone ran their mouth off completely predatory in the hunt for a ransom or just for fun  the reason doesnt matter  if you are going to make a corporation to pursue an profitmaking venture you have to defend it that is what a competetive sandbox is all about wardecs cannot be made completly optin and consensual as you are asking or the sandbox breaks besides we already have duels and intracorp agressions for now for completly consensual highsec combat now i am not saying wardecs are perfect  the current mechanic is far from perfect  but as a game design principle they need to be in the game but take a look at the devblog about the most recent changes to the wardec mechanic to see how they were at least envisioned to work you are suppose to defend your corp and its assets either by yourself or by hireing mercenaries to do that for you there cannot be a way to end the war without the consent of the aggressor or what is the point of the mechanic in the first placeeve gives a large amount of player freedom but you are not free to play in isolation of the other players  that is what a sandbox is all about you are free to play eve how you like but that doesnt mean the way you like should be the optimal way to play the game is structured to make it better to play in groups and with friends  you can play solo but dont expect it to be the easiest way so recruit some ship pvp players to your corp make an arrangement with another combat corp to defend you in exchange for some of your industry hire mercenaries to defend your corp do anything other than coming to the forums and begging for increased safety so you can make isk for yourself riskfree play the game
please read my posts again never have i said that wardecs should be removed or that pvp should be a choice all i said is that the way they currently work is stupid that includes the notion that the agressor should have all the power to end or prolong the wardecthere can be a way for the defender to end the wardec perfectly fine obviously it shouldnt be something that can be done from the safety of a station the defender will have to go out and they will have to fight the enemy to accomplish some sort of objective but if the defender wants to make an effort at ending the wardec then that option should be available as long as theyre willing to work for itthis works two fold because it gives the defender an actual reason to fight a fight they do not want to be involved in which actually gives the attacker more to shoot at the same time it gives the defender a shot at ending the war early if thats what they desire it gives both sides a reason to fight instead of just the attacker which is ultimately more fun for everyone certainly more fun than the current situation where the defender has absolutely no incentive to even go out and fight
i read your posts and you a proposing very unevelike artifical victory conditions for wardecs as i indicated this is quite silly as there can be quite varied victory condtions for the aggressor  perhaps he wants kills but perhaps he just wants to disrupt supply lines or to remove pocos or just wants to be paid to end the dec or maybe just because he doesnt like you and wants to make a point eve is a complex sandbox and reasons for all actions including wardecs cannot be pigeonholed easily so making wardecs into some sort of pvp battleground with defined victory conditions is a poor idea what is needed is some way to actually make the defenders want to defend their corp and assets make more things like pocos that improve all aspect of industry and pve so are valuble but vulnerable then intrinsically the defender has to fight or lose their assets and the bonuses they provide besides even if you had an artificial mechanism to end the war early a determined attacker that wanted to disrupt your corp would just use multiple wardeccing corps to do it so i am not sure what you think you will solve with thisbeing in a wardec is not the end of the world your time in eve should not just be spent trying to get out of them  if you pick one up fight a bit you might find out you like it or if not then just adopt wartime proceedures and adapt to it compete with them as was designed
that is actually the point war should cost the agressor substantially to initiate
this is correct ccp stated in the summer summit minutes they were thinking of either an occupancy based sov or a no sov system
dear csm dear mikethanks for this answerthat are good news if csm already proposed the ideafor hostile takeovers i think we must let it do as in a sandbox or in real corporationsin real life there is a choice when a company issues stocks  non voting shares voting shares proportions dividendsthe company can protect itself deciding to issue limited proportion of voting shares and offering a interesting dividend or a price increase benefit if it works well its an exampleall takeovers dont succeed in real life i dont see any reason that it works differently in a sandbox its a complex mechanism between power and interest you can be a rich company but if the shareholders want to keep the power they wont sellin any case it would bring a terrific extra dimension for this gameand it wont have negative consUFFFDquences on the pvp dimension like in real life at the opposite they would interact a war can have a effect on prices a hostile takeover can provoke a war to keep the company like a nationalizationa lot of fun so 
have one of those afk hot droppers in my home system now so i am either going to do something else in eve such as join a pvp fleet not really in the mood or i will just go play another game i would rather completely deny  people like that a kill you can argue that players should find a solution then you will argue about how many people a null sec system can support  and who the heck wants to keep many people on standby just to deal with one little  childif i have enough days like this i simply suspend my accounti can not believe that ccp havent found a solution to this in all these years before one of those children says it yes i am mad mad as a hatter  snip please refrain from personal attacks isd ezwal ever looked at the editted post history and gone  really i used the phrase attention deficient and this was deemed a personal attack it might be in this context but i think people who plant afk cloaked hot droppers are attention deficient they are buying tickets to attacks that they dont have the patience or more pointedly focused attention to hunt actively
aw whats wrong with having terrain wh effects are very nearly the only terrain in the game grand sky wizards were surely familiar with the effects in their home hole they were probably taking full advantage of themthe difference between a high sec incursion fleet and one outside high sec is that the former can optimize for completion time with all kinds of shiny stuff and the others have to compromise the pve efficacy of their fleets to accommodate the possibility of pvp wormholes are null sec if you field that kind of highly optimized shiny youre accepting a very real risk of loss which you can mitigate simply by flying cheaper and more pvpcapable ships or by having some ships that can counter any likely attackers on standby at the pos for the subcap pilots to go back and get rlmls drones and smartbombs could all have slaughtered that fleetmaybe not before taking losses but hey that means a good fight instead of a onesided slaughterwhen my old corp were in whs we never ran fleets that couldnt at least hold their own in a pvp fight until we had a chance to reship and that was before the frigate holes existed
i have no problem with the black hole effects in whs when i lived in a wh you could bait out a cloaky scanner or scan them down and kill them big effort but once done it was done and system was clearnow you kick them out and they just keep coming in no access control
these seem like outstanding characteristics for csm representation in a game all about numbers why are you running again i dont judge people by their race religion color size age gender or ethnicity i judge them by their grammar spelling syntax punctuation clarity of expression and logical consistency
please refer to the first post in the thread if you are having difficulty remembering why it is i am running
350m is pocket change maybe for you out in null but damn well not for high sec gankers also i think tengu is pointing out that going from 10 to 0 is not a reversal its starting fresh quite a big difference therefounder of violet squadron a small gang npsi community mail me for more information
im honestly putting tora and sabriz on my ballot they can duke it out over the tablein the end ccp decides what goes on and looks to the csm for their experience and opinions
oh sod off 350m was nothing well before i was out in null when you consider that the 350m isnt a recurring cost its a one off when you decide you want that character to be returned to legality it means even lessand its a reversal of the consequences if it can even be called that im sure tengu will come up with all manner of excuses for why hes not wrong but he understood what was being said and assumed that tags were expensive because many gankers like to whine about how expensive they are so it sounds like they are hard done bythe short of it is that ganking is too easy and without consequence hardly suited to the supposed hardcore nature of eve gankers are just the carebears of pvp
ganking is as easy or difficult as the victim makes it you can nerf ganking repeatedly as has been done over the years but eventually you have to stop trying to blame something else for being the problemwhat exactly do you find hardcore about people in highsec being able to move around and interact with the game in complete and utter safety which is brought closer by every nerf to gankinggankingbenefit possibility of making profit if you spend time organising a fleet scouting a target actioning the gank getting lucky with loot fairy and scooping loot successfullyconsequences cant undock in a ship for 15 mins after ganking cant move around high sec freely without risk of being shot at need to pay isk to restore sec statusantitank hauling  haulingmining afkbenefit dont need to be at keyboard can haul significantly more cargoconsequences at risk of being gankedall the people whining about code want is their consequence removed they can bleet on about how ganking is too easy despite the vast majority of them having no experience on the subject all they want but its basically a case of ccp my activity is being impacted by someone else please nerf them and buff me
bull this is victim blame plain and simple you people continuously state the gankees being it on themselves and you know thats horseshit whatever people did youd always find the weakest link and go for that because you dont want a challenge ganking should be possible but it should be a meaningful choice with meaningful consequences and associated cost and risk black pedro once suggested randomising concord timers for example a change like that introduces a level of risk to ganking you wouldnt just be able to pop a fit into a spreadsheet and say i need exactly x catalysts consequences are much harder with the existence of alts but certainly there needs to be a downside to choosing to play the villaini dont find it hardcore at all i dont find any of eve to be hardcore i hate this nonsense that somehow gankers are there providing some necessary service because high sec is too safe where realistically the whole game is as safe as you want it to be a ganker is no more daring by using a disposable ship to gank a carebearthe loot fairy balances out over time to a steady income as for the rest yes thats playing the game believe it or not people dont log in already doing whatever action it is they play on doing as for the consequences you cant undock for 15 mins  so thats not a consequence thats a cost if i triage a carrier im not going anywhere and im actually at risk while i do so its not a consequence of triaging its a cost for choosing that actioncant move around highsec freely  you dont need to a pod is effectively unstoppable and you use alts to shift your gear around you can eve take ships from an orca so you dont even need to undock a ship which is arguably the only time a gank ship is vulnerableneed to pay isk to restore sec status  this is the same thing as above its simply an alternative option to using alts compared to how much gankers can make its a low price and really only needs to be done once when youve decided you dont want to gank anymore as i said above sec status is the only thing that even resembles consequences yet its both irrelevant and reversibleno what they want is the understanding that just because you gank youre not suddenly daring you are just as much a carebear as an afk miner most gankers are on disposable alts using disposable ships and disposable pods so they can gank then get back on with whatever it is you were doing on their mains they are looking for easy riskfree killswhen people say that ganking needs to be balanced they mean just that i know that the second that happens your autism flairs up and you have this desperate need to attack people as if they are saying ganking should not be possible but thats not whats being said ganking is far too easy and has no real consequences its carebear pvp along with afk mining and many other mechanics it needs to be balanced so the choice to take that path actually means something
im going to allbutquote something malcanis said on another forum timers in their pure form are lazy design build the delay into the gameplay somehow he gave the example of a wormhole which all gatescynos essentially are that was warped and convoluted and possibly dangerous the more so the higher your jump fatigue is instead of a little stopwatch ticking down in one corner a current ingame example the switch from target ruin wait for analyzer to cycle to the current minigame which should be diversified and expanded just sayinfor a brilliant example albeit with very short cooldowns watch or play some combat in dragon age inquisition your character isnt standing there like an idiot waiting to discharge his aoe buff again hes twirling his staff and gesticulating and moving around like an active combatant the cooldowns more precisely windups are built into the animations its very slickif you want people to get stuck in a station for 15 minutes fine but at least try to pretend that theres an ingame holdup and ideally there should be some gameplay attached to the holdup nobody not even the most ebil piwate is playing the game to stare at an unchanging screen for 15 minutes while they do nothing
well i am surprised to read what i readmy corp was a friend begginer corps who suffered a lot of a chain wardecs from marmites i tried to spam many corps who where like insta wardecs by marmites by you tora we had a chat before you did it wardec new corps we made what happend  3 of my good friends left the corps after 2 months of marmites wardecs and stoped eve slowlyso you are clearly a part of what you described if it is an experience you made with your alilance i think it was maybe a too long experiencei got simple suggestions about wardecs they are part of the game and we need it what doesnt work is  a corp cant join an alliance to get protection while the corp is wardec this system is completly broken you can just desable a new corp this system has to be remoovedlike every wars wardecs has to have a real cost if you do it in the time for exemple  you can wardec an corp alliance lets keep the actual low cost no problems but an extra week will cost  times 4 200 million for the extra week another week  times for again  1 billion  and so one even in middle age i know siege could be very long it was fukin expensiv if you dont pursuit your wardec by paying the bill  then you cant wardec the corp alliance for 1 week this is it fair enough for wardecs corps who like it and trust me i can understand it fair enough to protect small corpsabout suicide gankers i did a suggestion for making it really challenging in a post i did simply  when you shoot someone you loose 25 of ss if you kill  you loose 10 ss witch means you have to prepare your security status to do it the actual system is way to simple and suicide gankers can almost chain what they dowhat may happen  less suicide gank more poeple self confident who will transport more and more expensiv stuffs everybody will be happy more noob transport without too hard problems more challenge for suicide gankers and more loot for them they will have to choose their targets carefullyedit  what you propose not being able to wardecs small corps less than x poeple is just the best way to protect and control small corps of poeple who makes wardecs plus it is the best way if you are the corp  alliance who receive the war to escape itthe best solution is to increase the cost for small corps  100 million and same system but times 5  500 million the seconde week 25 billion for the third week 10 billion for a month of waras simple as that
thats cheaper than ive ever paid besides doing it once sure thats fine doing it repeatedly gets expensive fast unless you wash your hands and never gank again you will be paying it more than once
i wish an excellent year 2015 to all capsuleers and fellow players of eve i am convinced that 2015 will be a great year for eve as ccp boldly moves forward with new changes especially sovereignty changes after showing to all that that there are no sacred cows anymore outside of the fact that eve online must continue to remain the complex but not just for the sake of complexity challenging and overall captivating mmo that it currently has been for 10 yearsthe csm x will be in the position to accompany these changes and represent the current community in so doing the mysteries of carolines star the unidentified invisible structures and roaming sleepers the introduction of thera and non colonisable wormholes the rule changes on clones upgrade wormholes being more dangerous and exciting again upgraded industry and uis jump fatigue graphic updates and many other recent changes have in my mind revitalised the game alreadyregardless of who ends up being elected i salute my fellow candidates and wish whoever ends up being elected a great tenure on csm x in 2015have a wonderful and fun new years eveje souhaite UFFFD tous les capsuliers et joueurs de eve une excellente annUFFFDe 2015je suis convaincu que 2015 seras une grande annUFFFDe pour eve online et que ccp continuera de changer le jeu avec audace en particulier les changements sur la souverainetUFFFD aprUFFFDs avoir demontrUFFFD quil ny a plus de vaches sacrUFFFDes et que eve online doit continuer a rester le mmo complexe mais sans UFFFDtre inutilement complexe exigeant et gUFFFDnUFFFDralement captivant quil a UFFFDtUFFFD depuis dix ans le csm x sera en place pour accompagner les changements UFFFD venir et reprUFFFDsenter la communautUFFFD dans ces nouvelles UFFFDtapes les mystUFFFDres de lUFFFDtoile de caroline les structures non identifiUFFFDes et invisibles et les dormeurssleepers itinUFFFDrants lintroduction de thera et des nouveaux trous de vers non colonisables les changement de rUFFFDgles sur la mise UFFFD jour des clones les trous de vers devenu plus dangereux et excitants UFFFD nouveau les amUFFFDliorations de lindustrie et des interfaces utilisateurs la jump fatigue les amUFFFDliorations graphiques et pleins dautres changements rUFFFDcents ont pour ma part dUFFFDjUFFFD revitalisUFFFD le jeu sans compter le support en franUFFFDaisindUFFFDpendemment de qui seras UFFFDlu au csm x je salue les autres candidats and souhaite UFFFD tout ceux qui seront UFFFDlu un excellent mandat pour le csm x en 2015passez tous une merveilleuse soirUFFFDe du nouvel an
a couple of things i would love to know the metric you use to measure risk so we could compare game styles in a objective wayyou have everyone fueling poss in your holes you dont have people who take a job and specialize in it when i lived in a class 5 i knew how to scan but i left it to others better at it when i run incursions i know how to do dps but i am better at logi though i will bring what the fc calls forbut why are we comparing apples and oranges each type of gameplay is an option to choose with pluses and minuses some choose the pvp route and complain that everyone makes more isk than them other choose the trade which if done properly has little risk and huge returns but you and i dont choose to do either of them not because they are wrong or bad they just are not for us if incursions are the be all and end all why is everyone not doing themyup they are boring you need skills there are gankers and people who try to run them for 2357 and fall asleep wiping a fleet there is the migration when someone takes the mom and the dead days when nothing is available there are days with too many in the system and competing for every site and losing some of them and there are days when no fleet is up there is the politics of the various communities and all of that is effort working for a living there are thieves who take all of the srp funds and the burnout of command types in short    it is eve as usual as i said previously would i like them to be more of a challenge more variation yes but that also goes for pve missions and a lot of other pve content there will always be some activity that makes the most isk what it is does not matter there is one and there will always be one so do we haul it down to our level or ascend to meet it surpass it or do we like what we do and do what we like and stop making isk the reason for playmmike azariah UFEFF UFFFDU30C4UFFFD

thats not the question ive flown with people who categorically refuse to join corporations where that kind of language is used because they hear enough of it aimed squarely at them in real life and so i refuse to in solidarity with them its not a question of your personal intentions or biases its a question of your respect for and acknowledgement of people for whom that is not just casual slangif youd rather keep the atmosphere relaxed for people who are used to throwing those words around than keep it relaxed for people who are used to having those words thrown at them youve made your choice and i appreciate your honesty in being clear about the choice youve made but its not about you or your intentions or any putative biases on your part
i think its somewhat unfair to pick on core given that 99 of fleets in null operate that way there is some degree of freedom of whom you fly with and if cores fleets exclude people who dont like hearing slurs then thats kind of his loss and conversely my loss of not having people who like to throw slurs around from my fleets people can find other people to fly with that suit their comms styles

neither have i but we wind up having to turn down a very large number of newbies because of the fear that they might awox or cause issues we reject between 3070 of applicants depending upon the particular phase of the moon and do not accept people who have not subscribed and are on trials these are people that could benefit from our help probably but have things that make us not willing to let them into alliancedata time i cant know about how many people i turn away who have the slightest thing suspicious about them that are actually bad but fortunately theres data from my coalitionmates who are more open brave does minimal filtering of new recruits allows 0 sp recruitstrials and recruits 600 people in a high volume month eg 20 per day there are 12 awoxers in brave that reveal themselves per day so thats a 510 rate unless you filter fairly stringently if youre accepting characters under a week or two old the targets of the awoxes are not just people flying expensive stuff like battleships but also things like pi haulers piloted by 23 month old charactersunfortunately its the 12 week old newbies that can most benefit from becoming part of a corp that will teach them useful things because theyre likely to be on trial and cluelessneeding help but the ease with which a 10hour trial hero alt can be spun up makes corps allergic to accepting trials with damn good reason im poorly qualified to make pronouncements about the state of wspace see also my response to the lowsec question i can tell you what my experience in wspace has been which is leading newbies in doing c4 sites a few times a month link points to a lovely article written by my spouse however my views dont represent people who actually live in wspace fulltime and i tend to defer to their opinions in general on wspace balance
this is not standard practice as i understand it for whnulllow  there are definitely some circumstances in which trialtraining corps exist with highly distinct identities from their mothership cf kenshin katana noir academy sniggwaffe but my experience is that the vast majority of corps tend to give people updown decisions for getting into the actual corp rather than using segregated corps with gradations of acceptance criteria that still live in the same space and do the same things for wspace in particular the lack of ability to share bookmarks between corps easily makes it pointless to have a separate newbie holding pen corp if that corp is just going to live in the same chains  theres little benefit to that risk mitigation no disagreement  improvements to corppos management would help substantially and i think are necessary to improve corp willingness to recruit newbies on trial accounts
as i argued elsewhere the actual problem with the change to incorp aggression mechanics is that corporation management sucks the only option available even to ccp itself is a gamewide onoff switch so i would say that anyone who doesnt like the change or who is ambivalent about the change should push hard for a change to corporation management and more broadly to the types of social groups that eve supports and contribute actively to any crowdsourcing that ccp solicits the better those tools are the fewer hamfisted changes ccp has to makejune if you want poses to become important assets as part as war dec reform id ask for that to be at least punted until corp management is fixed and at the very least pos defense modules have had a balance pass if your proposal went into effect before then id guess that the only result would be a number of poses getting pulled down preemptivelyedit also thanks for answering my questions thoroughly and thoughtfully
you mention being ecstatic that corps and alliances are being worked on what do you think of the recent push by jayne fillon mangala solaris sugar kyle and others to broaden player organizations beyond corps and alliances npsi standing fleets incursions and casualnew player organizations could all conceivably benefit and in fact alliances could even be reworked as one of these otherthancorp organizationsalso as adam smith said a corporation is just a union of companies1 what would you think of allowing more finegrained organization below the corporation level or even as someone sorry forget who suggested an ldapactive directory style model1 not so much any more but thats what they were when he put quill to paper
