lets do the bounce thread again
i still support this
current in game solutions to this issue are complicated and annoying so i will add a 1
ccp does love it when corp treachery makes the news that said it only makes the news it it was a huge theft and a trusted individual small corp theft and manufacturing job hissyfits do not make for an interesting read
yes i know but whats important here is to make eve hardcore game for its pvp pew pew style but it has to be as easy as possible to be able to steal few bil isk worth of assets ccp thinks we are iditots so if we like to steal it has to be easy or we would get bored quickly and its not just about the news its about the playerbase
to be honest id give ceosdirectors the ability to lock down in progress jobs so only ceosdirectors can cancel them
i think thats more fiddly and effort and can kind of be done by flipping roles on and off on members but still inhibits a corp thats building expensive items from actually encouraging and recruiting new industrialists
cant wait to sit in chribbas cockpit and cram ore into his special hold mmjhhmmmm
it would completely  over the use of capital ships in my opinioncant supporti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
im sorry our preferences ruin your sub caps onlinescrew this idea
i agree not only vagabond but all minmatar mainly their coloring now everything is basically black and blue now the minmatar t2 ships has no variability at all where are those awesome green lights frigates seems like cruisers now with those little guns and vagabond is shaved bold those ears maked it really what it was and represented minmatar style now its just black stabber1
edit posted by lazareth toxinthank  god someone cares about this disaster as much as i dothis was a complete failure on the part of the ccp ship designers taking a legendary ships like the vagabond and making them look like regular production ship so they can make their work on the ship skins easier to give us  hello kittie graphics then sticking some lame ass solarpanel on the side with a few lights to make us feel ok with their changeswhat are we idiots or noobs who dont know any better or give a along with the tragic changes to the vagabond they have in my opinion destroyed the beauty of the faction ships such as the tempest fleet issue by removing its iconic rectangular fins and other parts of the model and the typhoon fleet issue by removing its mast scaffolding and fuzzy antennas not to mention their earlier changes to all turrets which removed all the awesome tech 2 lights leaving all turrets looking like the tech 1 variants and while im at it they have over scaled the projectile turrets and made the architecture look clumsy and senselessccp seems to have taken on a new game model and that is to make everything in eve as simple and reproducible as possible to create an environment within the design departments of ccp that produces faster and cheaper which is destroying the original creative works that have made eve a uniquely beautiful and amazing experiencei am really into the way my ships look and work as well as fly and fight and that is why i have stripped my multibillion isk tempest fleet issue and typhoon fleet issue and placed them on the marker and will be doing the same to all my vagabonds very sooni once was a very proud minmatar pilot and now i wish i was amarrianand by the way  this 
since the focus of the winter expansion are the player poses i bet that any special ideas for lowsec pirate poses have the highest chance to be realized
keep this alive and in discussion and maybe somethign wil be done not all the ideas above are workable or ppopular but they are ideas that may spark better ideasmost importantly for lowsec ther emust be something to make lowsec life economically viable both on personal and corporatealliance level be that lowsec specific industry at poss or drug tradecreation that doesnt need nullsec black markets some things that just dont exist any where else to make lowsec unique and exciting and no not faction warfare that is seperate to what lowsec is it is just something that also happens in lowsec
easily the best suggestions for lowsec ive ever seen propsccp please take note
i recently discovered because im an fw noob that it is possible for a system in fw to be contested beyond 100 far far beyond 100 it may not be capped so 300 contested is apparently possiblethis can be done so that the system can be offensively plexed indefinitely allowing for a constant source of lp payouts by forcing multiple systems into vulnerable and not flipping them a militia can queue up a large number of systems that can be farmed for lp until they are ready to flip them all in one go and push for a high level warzone control tier boost in one hit because they are able to push the systems far beyond 100 contested it becomes impractical for the defending militia to do much about this defensive plexing is both boring and does not reward the pilot doing it so there is little incentive to spend long hours trying to resecure the system its just not fun and is a poor way to spend your free timemechanics should always encourage players to capture a system when possible so i suggest that a cap is placed on contesting to make defence viable and for rewards to be reconsidered so that system conquest is preferable to system farmingedit seems i wasnt clear enough i am not asking for lp to be paid out for defensive plexing i do think that the rewards for factional warfare in general should be reassessed but i do not think that handing out lp for running defensive plexes is a good ideathis proposal is about adding a cap on pushing systems beyond vulnerable status and on ceasing to pay out lp for offensive plexing in systems that have already reached vulnerable status the jotunn risi are now recruiting brutor ancestry required in order to best represent the brutor interest join channel joris to learn more
and my first thoughts on what to do about this separated from the problem partconsider the narrative of this situation the empire factions use their capsuleer militias as essentially mercenary forces to fight their proxy war we are rewarded for our efforts in helping to take territory from their mortal foes capture enemy facilitieskill enemy ships until a system becomes vulnerable then take it receive rewards in the form of faction goodies except that isnt happening here instead we are seeing the mercenaries deliberately prolonging the fighting in order to extract greater paymentwouldnt the employer eventually refuse to keep paying for a job that isnt being finished shouldnt it always be in the interests of the players to conquer a system rather than to leave it in enemy handswhen ccp introduced incursions they used an interesting phrasecurrently the empire factions dont care about that maybe they should  there could be several solutions to this issue place a cap on how far past 100 contested a system can be taken after that point completing sites ceases to pay out lp and the system cant be taken to a ridiculous level have the contested level fall over time perhaps scaling with the extent of contesting to make it harder to push far beyond 100 like in incursions move part of the lp rewards for offensive plexing over to paying out only once the system has been captured or grant additional rewards beyond current level this might need a time limit of sorts so that only sites completed within 7 days of the system being taken pay out the bonus you get paid as you go and again for finishing the job the jotunn risi are now recruiting brutor ancestry required in order to best represent the brutor interest join channel joris to learn more
sorry you didnt get the jokeim the only one who gets me anyway so no loss
translationim so intimidated by invisible frigates that i refuse to consider the impact it would have on all the other valid uses of a balanced game mechanic and insist that cloaking be nerfed

confusing mechanics are confusingcannot support as it is too open for abusei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
you can do pi in high sec the only issue is the higher the security rating of the system the less materials you will geti am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
this is precisely what all this is about someone who preaches the same old boring and wrong message the ships i and my friends lost were tanked t2 total defence fit with ecm drones we were watchig local we did dscan we were flying with others  and still lost ships in 07 systems to alpha strike destoyersgo look at the killboards you troll no wait ccp already did that  and realised that tanked exhumers were going down all over the place and that the riskrewardcost ratios were totally off and they have responded by making major changes to mining shipsaslo zim you say alpha needed to be made so strong because logistics have become so strong that shows precisely the kind of bad design calls ccp has been making over the past few years i agree logistics can be insane but i didnt add rigs to the game or make t2 rigs combined faction gear rediculously overpowered none of the rubish changes to combat over the past few years is my fualt whatsoever  but it is the fault of people like you lord zim for not giving ccp timely and accurate feedback on issues and generating better options on how to fix emerging issues i love new mods are they balanced no the latest ones lead to some rediculous outcomes from a game design point of view  but i am not venturing into saying how pvp between combat ships should be balanced that is not an area i honestly care much about i do however care when bad design calls lead to gameplay that makes my friends quit eve and they have over hulkageddon and i applaud ccp for fronting up with new ship designs now i would love to see them send out a come back to eve get a free exhumer email to everyone who unsubbed and who has an exhumer loss on thier account from the past 3 months end of the day this is about paying customers playing and enjoying the game  stop being so livid that just for once ccp is paying attention to miners rather than listening to the flawed rantings of the pvp  pro greifing crowds so ccp  how about adding that gas mining ship next
uh no my magstabs happen to be 2x mlu ii for higher m3min aka dps granted this is primarily used in quiet systems anywhere with neutrals gets tank over gank ie mining yield  though it doesnt stop me from losing hulks to stupid reasons  like the pos getting sploded
and that is a hassle if you change fleets allot like in incursionsi think there should be predefined overviews for wartargets fleet only  dont think that it would be to hard to fix implement but who knows how the source code to this isurl
or yknow you can just have an alt make a courier contract to yourself which puts all those rigged ships in a nice neat boxentire thread
could but why should someone have to do thatit just proves exectly how broken the logistical aspect of operating in new eden really isthere are so many vessel roles that could be filled but arent due to the fact that so much other  is broken and taking away from development of new content i am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
our top story tonight covers the predicted shift in gender choice for new character creation females are up 95 yes please
loli would keep my male character this is what alts are for p
sure you could they just both wouldnt get the bonuses this seems reasonablewell maybe i really dont know would you still maybe have one in a t3 fleet yeah you would probably not want to run the no tank all booster variety but whether any sort of fits with a booster would ever be viable i dont know but even if your right the advantages to eve combat as a whole i think far outweigh nerfing the effectiveness of this one ability that t3s have make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
 1 i dont think ccp will do anything about it although this would be the best change in eve online i ever heard of im also sure that if ccp supports our progress we would support them greatly
i like to add few things that always annoyed me so mucha corporation hangars has only 7 tabs for people living far from highsec and ussing pos is a nightmare esspecially when you are about to recruit new people giving them access to tab 1 will give them access to other hangars tab 1 in other pos for example b alliance has no access to any of the hangarsc when researching for example you cant use inputoutput any other than the tab bpo is ind processing gas requires roles that will allow you to offline and unanchor any pos that belong to this corporation
1 from meim not going to expand my corp which id love to do until i can lock down bposbpcsinterface so that corp members can use them but not remove them from either a corp hanger in a staion or a hanger in a lab and lock down jobs so that peopl
hmm maybe im confused but when the previous job finishes it doesnt stop someone from using that lab slot so this isnt needed you would want to prevent any member from delivering any job because otherwise your newbie corp member could sneak on to complete a jump freighter build and deliver it assuming you have a production tab where members can place their minerals and such in order to run the jobceodirector would maintain their current roles and be able to cancelcomplete all jobs being done in corporation owned facilities
confirming we need our frill returnedthank you 1
1 i feel naked without my frill
supporting for greater justice
thread is just the reason why we should have unlikesop unliked gosh if only we could
i am here to state my agreement with ugleb something and it can be any number of things needs to be done about the current system in the current state it is not in the best interest to conquer a vulnerable system for your own militia as it not only removes a farming ground for you and your allies but also grants your enemies a system to farm loyalty points in themselves theres also the fact that in conquering a system your enemies might not be willing to flip the system themselves when they get make it vulnerable because itd remove their own farming ground as well
i cant help but think that the lack of reward for defensive plexing also plays a partwhat is the point of defensive plexing a 95 contested system when you can wait for it to flip assuming the mechanic isnt being abused to lock a system and then offensive plex for profitmy suggestion have exactly the same reward as offensive plexing but use the contested percentage as the multiplierfor example20k lp plex  90 contested system  18k lp payout20k lp plex  07 contested system  140 lp payouti think that is a fair reward vs risk that ccp are concerned about
i agree people shouldnt keep getting lp for doing plexes after a system is vulnerable whether they can make it more contested by doing plexes for free i think that is debatable beyond that this is just another minmatar thread asking for lp for defensive plexing to that i sayif you want to defend your system you should do it by killing the war targets who are running offensive plexes not by waiting for the war targets to leave and then running a defensive plex there are many many good reasons not to have lp for defensive plexing amarrs main method to make a comeback was based on no lp for defensive plexing if ccp changes the rules and allows lp for defensive plexing i think you see nulli sticking around and farming defensive plexes just like they are farming plexes in systems that are already vulnerable the compeling reason to not award lp for defensive plexing is that it gives some reason to continue to fight for the side that is currently down i would rather they did away with defensive plexing altogether force the winning side to actually fight the offensive plexer in order to defend their system defending your system by running a plex when wartargets arent even present is lame and deserves no rewardthe other option would be to make a player have to pay lp in order to have his defensive plex lower the amount the system is contested in sum the system is liekly too lopsided for the winning side we dont need to make it more lopsided but here are some other reasons its good not to give lp for dplexing1 encourages the defending side to stop plexers in pvp before they capture a plex so that they do not need to orbit a button for no pay defensive plexing is best understood as punishment for not defendig your system properly in pvp 2 gives some reason to join the side with fewer systems since although your lp is worth very little you have more opportunities to make lp through plexing it also limits the winning sides ability to make lp through plexing yes they can still make lp from missions but that does not help their occupancy efforts and if enough people switch over to missioning instead of plexing then the side with fewer systems is given some respite3 it can lead to a war where many systems become vulnerable or close to vulnerable and then flipped in a dramatic fashion sort of the topic of this thread as i mention this can lead to all of the militia getting the isk needed to sustain constant pvp 4 its sort of neat to use individual greed as a balance 5 if you want to farm systems where your enemy cant even dock then eve offers that already sov null sec i think sov null sec could greatly benefit from a system like this where you are rewarded for taking over new space instead of just sitting in your space and farming it imo that is a big reason why null sec has been so boring for the last few years by forcing people to take over new space in order to gain isk you encourage conflict make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
this is actually  brilliant makes deplexing the more highly contested systems worthwhile due to the fact that they are highly contested they will likely also be fought over id imagine this is a way to add more incentive to combat
you can not upgrade a system to hit higher tiers that is is not owned by your militia so you want to hold as many systems as you can for as long as you can but yes killing offensive plexers in pvp and preventing the system from being contested in the first place is the optimal way to do this defensive plexing is something that you should rarely have to resort to and having to do it for no lp is somewhat of a punishment for letting the enemy capture so many plexes to begin with this is a very good thing ccp has done there is nothing wrong with the current lp payout structure why is rewarding defensive plexing good for the game again you are rewarding players for sitting back while the enemy oplexes thier system without a fight then after they leave you can get in your vigil and dplex and get more lpmake faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
im going to stop you right there neither the op nor my follow up post containing suggestions even mentions adding a reward for defensive plexing the issue i am raising here is that the mechanics currently favour not flipping systems which is not how things should worki also try very hard to look at the mechanics from both sides im not arguing for a change because i think it would suit my militia this thread might be started by a player who happens to be in the minmatar militia but it is not intended to become a minmatar thread please dont pigeon hole me so quicklyif i want to beat the prominmatar drums ill post on the igs the jotunn risi are now recruiting brutor ancestry required in order to best represent the brutor interest join channel joris to learn more
ok fair enough i do agree that vulnerable systems should stop giving lp for capturing complexes beyond that if the vulnerability decays i think that will then allow people to keep farming systems plus if one side is truly outnumbered it makes it harder for them to get back to a decent tier i think the vulnerablility should remain and not decaythe system does not favor not flipping systems you do not get any lp benefits unless you start flipping systems however it does favor timing when you flip systems but that is a good thing imo it will add varietybasically you have the plexing phase where you are either trying to hold on to 80 of the systems or trying to get 80 vulnerable this phase involves allot of small ship combat we are in that phase now then you have the flipping phase this phase involves allot of larger ship combat we really never had that phase in the amarr minmatar war i am interested to see how this plays out make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i have a similar concern it adds uncertainty and is probably overly complex id prefer a straight forward cap at 100 or just above i think i just threw that one out as it crossed my mind while bashing keyboard the jotunn risi are now recruiting brutor ancestry required in order to best represent the brutor interest join channel joris to learn more
bump seriously where the hell is this
oh god no not because it would bother me but because the antismoking zealots wouldnt ever shut up about itin their defense smoking is disgusting nothing worse than seeing a gorgeous girl put a cigarette in her mouth it just ruins the whole image im just not the type to go all berserk about it
very simple and straight forwardadd the ability for us to save the current ui setup which would include window positions overview setup channels open otherand then allow a different one to be saved this allows you to have one ui layout for pvp for example and one ui layout for station spinning or ratting etcgood idea submitted for your review

i wonder if this is due to having camera shake turned offit sounds like the wobble is due to the camera turning rather than moving
mara rinn  i tested this with camera shake on and with it off i didnt see any changes however the test was only done in station anyway its always been my impression that camera shake is only in play during certain parts of warp and when your ship
its perfectly normal camera is not moving it keeps it place however it does rotate slightly around itself there is no parallax effect because camera is not moving it rotates on axis centered on itself it does not change positiontrying holding right button and move thats what happens just on smaller scale camera rotation does not affect relation of point of view your ship and backgroundthere is nothing technically wrong with it
the most ironic thing is that of all the things in the game that defy our current understanding of physics you pick this the entire game defies our current understanding of physics and more specifically quantum physicswhy dont we start an argument on why we can travel faster than the speed of light in this game even though current laws dictate that is impossible same sort of argument as yours op  its irrelevant and nobody caresplanets are stationary bodies in eve  they dont orbit anything or move in the slightest couldnt be further from reality there are millions of examples like these of how the game defies the laws of physics as we understand them today thats the fun of a game set in the future  they can do what they want move on
im still hoping to hear from someone who actually remembers probably well over a year ago now when the ship actually floated in the station like a real 3d object  and you could see the background behind it shift disappearing and reappearing slightly behind the image of the ship perhaps it was always much more noticeable with a large ship since they tend to be closer to your actual pov check abdiels post for a good explanation
i remember when there was more movement but still there is nothing physically wrong with current situation its just your preference toward old model
op doesnt know what 3d is wowi seriously dont know what to say to this
you cant expect a significant observable parallax when youre spinning the camera around an objectalso lets encourage ccp to put effort into things that improve the game not stuff that only gets noticed by analretentive people who feel something doesnt look quite right
posted this on another related thread
congratz you just got quotedanyway i too would like to know when people quote me mainly because 99 of the time its bad trolls and i want to see how badly they picked apart my post
i fully support this idea we really need this
then show your support and contact the csm tell them you want this and get all of your friends who might be interested to do the samei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
overall i support this proposal i would like to see a more nuanced change where you had to be within x au x km away from a posstationgate unless the fleet is on grid with you no boosts from inside the pos bubble etc at the end of the day if youre uncloaked and outside of a pos youre vulnerable however as a quick and initial fix i support this
unlike the orca the roqual goes into indu siege mode for fleet boosting  making it immoblie and very vulnerable to roams if it needs to be on the gridrorqual transformation
i support this
double post
1i had a couple members that wanted to use the pos but there was no way to allow them to use it for research without giving them the ability to end a capital job that was taking place at the time
i think the whole role management needs to be reworked and yes this is a serious issuealso we dislike such minor facts that roletitles are displayed on the character info because of this some corps are using asciiart titles without meaning so outsiders cant even get what kind of roles should that toon bear witheven more itd be needed to give access to arbitrary installationsarrayswhatever to members and having arbitrary number of wallet divisions maybe corp hangarsalso alliancelevel roles would be nice even alliance hangars with roles
i believe you can work around this problem in the pos management window by changing the onlineoffline option to pos fueler rather than starbase manager
whilst i think youre entirely right my goal here is to get a hotfix to what i think is the single largest biggest issue with the roles currently i dont htink anyone dissagrees that a total overhaul is in need

after reading the csm minutes it seemed that the csm wanted a way to eject inactive members from council and they could not come to an agreement with ccp for a proper system to do soi suggest a vote of no confidence systema csm member would put together a document explaining in detail why a vote of no confidence should be held for a specific council member and present it to the chairman for reviewthis document must have many legitimate reasons why a vote of no confidence should be held it should be held for purely functional and not political reasons for why a council member should be subject to the vote it should be held for reasons like but not limited todoes not attend meetingshas attempted to interfere with csm communications to the communitydoes not contribute on the csm forumsdoes not attend skypeand must have irrefutable proof of these absences or transgressionsthe chairman then decides weather or not to hold the vote of no confidence if heshe agrees heshe then holds the vote of no confidence with all council members with the exception of the member for which the vote is being held the person for which the vote of no confidence is being held must be informed of this imminent threat to there position before and when the vote is being held all council members must render a single aye or neh response the councils decision must be completely unanimous if all are ayes then the chairman presents the document that was the list of reasons for the vote of no confidence to ccp for the final ruling if ccp agrees that the member is a non contributing member on the council then the vote of no confidence is passed and a run off is held for the persons seat on the council in this run off the person who has received the vote of no confidence can rerun to re attain there seat on the councilthis system has so many checks and balances present it would be very difficult for a council member to be ejected for political and not functional reasons this would bring an extra layer of accountability to council members this system gives ccp a final word on weather or not a csm member can be removed from the council
1 to bring back the vagas thrill frill
why is it that when i came to lowsec i found so many people asking ccp to give them rewards for defending their own the reward is that you get to keep it
didnt want that space anyway tm
you so intimated  all right if you feel thats your bussiness
so i was reading through the minutes recently posted elsewhere and for the most part it was informative but not really all that exciting but what drew my attention was soundwaves bit about ring mining im a miner but aside from that it drew my attention to ccps failure to recognize that lownull needs more incentives and at the same time high sec needs to stop being seen as a starter zone there will always be those of us who want the lower risk lifering mining lownull only hmph for a company that seems to have the goal of wanting hisec to be a starter zone you guys sure dont act like it by putting ring mining in lownull only you entice miners out of hisec no doubt the problem is by not putting them in highsec you dont allow people to test them out in a low risk environment simply lower the yields the profit this way the highsec miners can try it out and if they like it and want to make real money off it they move into lownull to pursue it yes you will have some that will ring mine in high forever regardless but it ups the chance of migration more than simply saying nope you dont get thisaccept that there will always be those who prefer the hisec life those who dont want a target on their back 247 everything thats available in lownull should be available in high in a lesser form this way it allows players to get into it and gives them some real ideas about what theyd be looking at on other side now you also need reciprocity though which isnt there lownull needs to have all the options of high industryminingpve all of it across the board has to be raised up to the point where its not just a bit more profitable but a ton more profitablesimplest way i can think of accomplishing this highsec profit values stay as is except perhaps lvl 3 missions new players trying to get into lvl 4s are in hell and maybe add the chance for some faction loot from missioning not a high one mind you just enough to give the highsecers a taste of whats out there then you up low and null by 100200 across the board mission rewards rat bounties mining maybe create new variations of the highsec ores in low sec that are far higher yield all of it and maybe consider adding a few concord bastions in 00 a single highsec sector one in the north one south one east one west the safe trade spots the jitas of low seci could go on but this wall of text is long enough and i honestly doubt anyone other than the trolls will read it but ive come to believe if you dont say anything cant expect any change so take it for what it is just some feedback
in my eyes low and nullsec just dont exist i have zero interest in anything the two areas have to offer and i wont even consider going back again low and null simply dont exist to me anymoreand im certainly not the only one who shares that mentality its not that im adverse to pvp i love it however the game mechanics and player politics are so unforgivably awful in low and especially nullif ring minging becomes exclusively for low andor null then ccp may as well not even waste the effort to create itthe new lowsec gate gun changes look promising but i worry ccp might cave in to the very small yet very vocal minority who oppose changesummary of eves last four expansions
you guys do understand that ring mining is for a resource that is currently unavailable in highsec rightthis would change precisely nothing for you
per greyscale theyre also not coming any time soon its theorycraft from a csm meeting so far as we know
i question the logic of trying to entice helpless ships into pvp areasyou can add all kinds of value but if acquisition makes you a sitting duck it weakens the draw lowsec content currently favors the aggressorpirate that needs to change imho and there are lots of ways to do it the problem is that i hear a lot of UFFFDi want more pvpUFFFD and UFFFDletUFFFDs get more people in lowsecUFFFD but often really mean UFFFDi want more easy kills that have nice modulesUFFFD thatUFFFDs a problem because the aggressors want the odds in their favorso no i donUFFFDt think ring mining should be a lowsec only thing i also think it should be highly dangerous to a ship not specializefit for it esp in lowsec i would like to see it mask signatures so that ships are hard to find
i also want to safely mine technetium in fleets of skiffs in hisec
as for the points about how its not fair that industrial players shouldnt be forced into lownullif you dont want to risk going out there then thats your decisionbut the idea is that the people that actually have the balls to do so will reap the rewardsthe chain of pvp in lownull goes like thisfarmers ratting ravens are just as helpless as mining barges get preyed on by solo and small gangssolo people get preyed on by small gangs and medium gangssmall gangs get preyed on by midsize gangsmidsize gangs get preyed on by large gangslarge gangs fight other large gangsthe point is that increased rewards in lownull means that theres more farmers which means increased pvp across the board the more people that are in space potentially dying the betterbut you might say all i do is hisec industry what do i care about increased pvpincreased pvp means more ships dying more ships dying means that the market doesnt stagnate and that demand remains high higher the demand the more money you can make off your productsso even if ccp releases an industry buff to lownull even the hiseconly players gain from it
i propose turning oasa into an npc region or adding an npc region into the drone lands this i believe would add more activity to the region
a fine well thought out and highly detailed proposal i fully support this idea product andor service
you totally can even if ship stands still background is moving its only when camera rotates around itself look around mode that ship always covers same area on background therefore no parallaxas for there is no lens camera is literally point that rotates on itself sure realistically there is lens distance and observable parallax for example turning your eyes moves lens within the eye allowing you to see from different pov but it doesnt happen in most 3d engines
with all the upcoming changes regarding aggression and flagging i want to toss this idea out i posted it in another thread but the more i think about it the more i want to see itas i understand it once crimewatch goes live there will be 15 minute times for the suspect and criminal flags im proposing to take that timer and multiply it by a systems security status flipping a can in a 05 system would get you just 7 12 minutes of suspect flagging instead of the full 15 piracy in a 01 would result in just 90 seconds of flagging where you would get 6 minutes in a 04this would help blur the lines between high and lowsec and make those sec levels matter for more than npc spawns
it would also incorporate the existing corner case of shut off flags when youre in null overall its very elegant but it would require quite extensive testing on sisi to see what it does to fights and such
yeah thats something that crossed my mind but i didnt really feel the need to include it i was going for short and sweet my expectation would be that both lowsec piracy and highsec ganking would naturally migrate toward the lowersec systems because the penalties are lighter there with a shorter gcc timer in 05s gankers could reship sooner if some variation on the hotlydebated sentry guns changes comes about lowsec gate camps would be more viable in the lower sec systems i dont really see a downsidebut them im not looking at it from the perspective of the carebear who would just as soon see gankers get podded by concord and such
i assume that changing systems after you receive a timer wont alter the timer and the only system security level that matters is that of the system in which you earned your flag i think i like this idea it does severely limit the penalties to criminal and suspect activities in lower security systems it would also be a huge boon to suicide ganking in 05  06 systems as proposed i think you would have to rebalance the gcc  suspect timers on some level i think this proposal should be reversed i think that the lower the security of a system the more policing should fall on players rather than concord gate guns etc gcc is a concord npc thing so im totally down with lowering that timer with lower system security however suspect flags allow players to hunt down and shoot other players and i actually think that should be extended with lower system security perhaps couple it with a mechanic to help wannabe police players aka spam pragmatically hunt down players that currently have a suspect flag and you have some awesome potential
doing otherwise would probably be a nightmare for the devs and runs contrary to my vision of how it should work soyesthe impact it would have on highsec ganking is that you could gank in a 05 twice as frequently as you could in a 10 i dont expect any adjustments would need to be made that really depends on things like sentry gun mechanics if greyscales sentries come into play along with crimewatch then we really do need a mechanic that will shorten the duration of the suspect flag the further you get from secure spaceremember that you can always shoot a pirate with a 5 sec status and that if theyve recently killed you you have kill rights on them and can engage them anywhere the suspect and criminal flags are intended to allow everyone to shoot you without losing their own sec status a long time ago i posted an idea for creating concord deputy players and corporations where they would be alerted to local gcc events as beacons on their overview i would imagine thats similar to your idea
not supported because the proposed suspect system is terrible
from the current state the impact is you can suicide gank twice as frequently in 05 systems than currently this is a big boon to suicide ganking although thats not a bad thing necessarily im not referring to pirates imagine im a suicide ganker that makes a living ganking industrials traveling through niarja 05 with your change i can now gank twice as often since my gcc  aggression timers are now 75m instead of 15m im suggesting that your gcc which controls concord response gets reduced to 75m but your suspect timer which allows other players to shoot you is increased to 30 m extreme example now i can go suicide ganking again very quickly after 75ish m becuase thats when my gcc ends but i must fear some good samaritan player that tries to thwart my operation by attacking me before i can gank another industrial which they could do as long as i have the suspect flag there are two things im not very certain of 1 for lowsec gate  station gun mechanics currently when you go gcc you get attacked by gate and station guns but when you go gcc you also gain an npc aggression timer to the gate gun owners gate and station guns will automatically shoot you whenever you get near them until both the gcc timer and npc aggression timer ends whenever the guns do shoot at you youre npc timer is renewed and sometimes your gcc timer is also renew i think im not sure how these timers are changing with the new crimewatch system what i hope for is that gate guns only fire at you while you have a gcc flag but will leave you alone when you have the suspect flag this way a short gcc timer means you only have to worry about station guns and gate guns for a short period of time and a long suspect timer means good samaritans can freely aggress you for an extended period of time i want to enhance player on player violence which this is directly doing i am not certain how gcc  suspect timers will be renewed and thats also an important thing to consider 2 for highsec player aggression timers vs gcc timers imagine im a miner in a belt a talos lands and attempts to suicide gang me i deploy ec drones which jam out the taloswhich then dies to concord the talos currently gets a 15 minute gcc timer for his actions meaning if he boards a spaceship within highsec during that window concord will spawn and blow him up you want to reduce this timer to 75 minutes in a 05 system however there is another timer of major concern here because i aggressed the talos with ec drones i have a 15 minute agression timer with the talos pilot so with the gcc changes 8 minutes later that pilot can be back in a new talos in space hunting me down if he finds me before my 15 minute agression timer ends he can legally shoot me without concord intervention because of the timer i have for defending myself this loophole needs to be closed im under the impression that a major point in changing crimewatch is to reduce the who can shoot at who branching crazy timers madness that is currently crimewatch im very uncertain how the new crimewatch system will deal with defensive timers ie howwhen can the talos pilot return fire this could be a simple change of reducing the return fire timer to the same length of the gcc but i dont fully understand the new system yet again its not so much as gcc events that i care about as much as suspect events gcc gets handled by concord and gate guns suspect events should be handled by players ive readheardthoughtdiscussed overview beacons to allow spam to chase down such pilots but i havent seen anything that seemed appropriately balanced
can you elaborate why the proposed suspect system is terrible it opens up aggression to all players which is a good thing
i think its a rather terrible idea that sentry guns will shoot you for taking stuff that has been jettisoned into space im against crimewatch but ccp doggedly insists upon it so im making the best of a bad situation by trying to temper it
ill give a few reasons and short explanations im not trying to derail the thread1 it eliminates current canflipping mechanics as valid ways to gain aggression for 1v1s arranged fights making sure you dont get concorded for shooting your mission mate etc2 it isnt as newbiefriendly as its intention since if you screw up and loot your friends alts etc can you are now flagged to everyone rather than yourselfyour friend and most likely get exploded3 it imposes a clear sense of morality on various actions that were previously left entirely in the hands of the players4 it removes a nontrivial reason to join a corp for miners and missionersmutual defense ie currently if you steal you are flagged to the corporation that you stole from now you will be flagged to everyone regardless of whether your target was in an npc or player corp5 its basically going to kill off can flipping wreck stealing etc in high security space while this is mainly used as a form of griefing it can still result in good fights and ccp used to take the stance that more things explodingbetter6 the changes are poorly thought out as evidenced by developer posts in other threads about the topic eg there were originally going to be invincible logis7 these radical changes are not needed all that was asked forreally necessary was changes to neutral rr if you want to make can flipping less of a newbie ganking tactic and more of a sandbox thing simply make sure to include more detailed instructions on aggression mechanics in the tutorial additionally expand the current aggression flagging system to include alliances not just corporations put things in the hands of player groups dont create a global flag for things as silly as property theft8 recent discussion of this sentry gun thing reinforces points 6 and 3 sentry guns shooting you for can theft reallythese are just off the top of my head ill add more if i think of them laterthe bottom line is that the proposed suspect system introduces a global flag for actions that do not give the suspectaggressor any additional options in terms of perpetrating a criminal act shooting another ship etc this is a huge departure from what eve has been imo it represents a significant shift in ccpseves direction as a game to become much much softer and more carebearesque i will be unsubscribing if these changes take effect not because im a can flipper extraordinaire but because i can see the writing on the wall these changes dont matter too much now but i can see where the game will be 12 years after these changes and would much rather take my money elsewherei think i just derailed the thread floppie scaling gcc in particular between the lowhigh barrier makes perfect sense but im not sure youre going to be able to scale gcc within 510 due to how it would enable increased suicide ganking additionally it doesnt make sense to me for gcc to scale within 510 the police know you did something bad and theyre going to blow you up and mark you down 5 is the inner city and they might take longer to respond but theres still a warrant out for your arrest
this is my understanding of crimewatch although i could be wrong 1 if i take from a can that isnt mine i gain a suspect flag for stealing a minor criminal act with a suspect flag everyone can legally shoot me if they shoot me i can shoot them back if the person im returning fire on has logistics support im sol as i cannot shoot their logi pilot meaning im at a big disadvantage when ive gone suspect which is the tadeoff for stealing the loot if i rep a player with a suspect flag i gain the suspect flag edit ive read the minutes on sentry gun aggro i dont think sentries or npcs should get involved in suspect fights i also dont think its acceptable for gate guns to be able to kill triaged carriers within 5 minutes however ccp clearly said these were not set in stone and would be discussed at an upcoming dateforum 2 if i illegally shoot another player i gain a criminal flag like gcc and a suspect flag the criminal flag means that gate  station guns shoot me navys attack and concord will deathray me in general shooting anything that is not yours or your corps is illegal with the following exceptions you have a wardec you have killrights they are currently flagged as a suspect or you are defending your ship from their aggression if you assist rep a ciminally flagged player you become criminally flagged im sure im leaving something off but i dont understand how this is terrible perhaps i need to go read some dev post i missed in which case please point me in that direction
thank you for your responses i think life is far far more entertaining when you are valid target everyone as opposed to a single corp and your much much more likely to get fights and escalations when you increase the number of people that can shoot at you this will hurt wreckbating mission runners and can flipping miners but i dont think this will hurt anyone that actually partakes in pvp invulnerable logis suck and this should be fixed somehow id recommend a samaritan flag where shooting a suspect gives you the samaritan flag and aiding reps a samaritan gives you a samaritan flag when you have a samaritan flag all suspects can legally shoot you make the samaritan flag only 2 minutes or something very short compared to the suspect flag gate guns shooting suspects is pretty  and this should be fixed so they only shoot criminals in my experience can flipping is about ganking not about 1v1s im fairly certain they are working on a 1v1 mechanic to replace can flipping as long as ccp doesnt prevent you from doing something immoral who cares about the morality of an action it still sounds like suspect actions will be in the hands of players to punish these changes are to make the server run smoother and simplify the crimewatch system which is bloated and awkward and difficult to work around furthermore the global flagging system is setup purposely to put enforcement in the hands of players its just extending the playerbase that can enforce it from a single player or corp to all players
the incentive is that you get to keep your system is that not reason enough
helloi was thinking of maybe itd be time to also care about the vets and not just about the new playersas of this im thinking of focusing on things that are annoyance and sometimes broken and they are a real pita for the longterm player which being honest are present in big quantities in the game also some of these stuff also can annoy the new players like things being inconvenientto get actual examples im listing a few stuff here to get the ideagui ergonomy  why having the option to copypeme a bpc if thats impossible or reverse engineering something that cant be  why do i have to put something into the market quickbar from the search tab i know this is being changed to get the find in contracts option  why do i have to open the charinfo dialog of a corps ceo to get the send message option in the rclick menu it should be right there  why cant i promote an arbitrary system to be a waypoint in the ap instead of this why do i have to manually addreaddwhatever the stuff to get this done  why dont we have an option to open a ships smbchb just like opening a regular cargo can seems like the logical way to do it  multiline tabs for the chat windowgui consistency  standing dialogs different for poss outposts pocos contacts etc why not unify thembroken stuff  the remote manufacturingrd skills ought to work on assets in space this shouldnt be fixed by putting this limitation into the descriptions of these skillswere facing suchlike things on a daily bases and these are not really improving our game experience and also the newbies dont understand things like rclick options for bpcs and its misleading to them
with pos becoming modular hopefully it will improve the life living out of a worm hole i totally agree currently it sucks trying to manage a pos to live out of in wspace hopefully ccp takes some pointers from the modular pos systemi totally agree that there needs to be some form of personal storage set up for pos it does not have to be comfortable to live out a pos you might not be able to dock like a station but having something that would allow repackaging of items and personal storage space would improve the current system 100 fold being able to claim sov in wh i really cannot support nor could i support stations in wh spacei could support an xlarge pos that is only deploy able in wh space that can be destroyed that acts similar to a station concept is a good idealogistics in and out of a worm hole is a big enough pain in the ass as it is having a spot to safely store personal assets would be a huge improvement and totally supported
yeah exactly
yeah the vagabond looks ood without the frill i would make it slighty different than before for the change but so that it would still be a frill
this post is a copy from my post in the tutorial revamp thread i think it better fits herejust a little idea for the tutorialshave npcs that can show up in your captain quarters and tell you something about the game what you can do with them1 let them tell you what they have to say next through the main dialogue2 ask questions from a list queries to a database gives a random list from the available dialogues of that npc3 send them to hell vote them down they will never come back to you4 add them to contacts subscribethe nasty idea behind it have the players create those dialogues points 3 and 4 are there to get a ranking of those npcs for point 1 and 2 we would need a convincing interface to build dialogues but that shouldnt be too hard if it is text based making npcs with the charakter editor is easy that is already there they just need a little script for coming into the room and leaving and some gesture while they talkplayers can share their knowledge with noobies do a bit of advertising for themsevles and their organization which leads new guys to corps faster and fluff out the universeeducational corporations will add a great lot of helpfull stuff into such a system and i think many people will love to make a coolfunnywhatever guy and put a lot of effort in itthe downside is i dont exactly know if the voting system is enough to prevent misuse by spammers and scammers but wikis work so why shouldnt this one workwhen this runs a while you can go through the highly voted list and adapt some of the dialogues for the official help have own npcs wich cite the player made ones give some credits this would not only give players a new thing to explore it would also add meaningful functionality to the captains quarters of course it also could be done in a com window like talking to an agent but i think the captains quarters and the functionality of a scriptable npc avatar just have some emote tags in the dialogues when you create them which trigger animation would be awesome

because there are components used in capital ship production that arent used in normal tech 1 ship production i made my post small to show a general trend and get people thinking im impressed that i got even a few intelligent replies yours included it is a huge leap from the normwhen i give the answers in my post and people jump in and flame me because they disagree with things they didnt even bother to read1 the simple solution is to increase the amount of nonstandard materials used in capital ship production2 the net result will be an increase in capital ship price and a decrease in capital ship numbers
im inclined to believe youre joking or trolling but the way you worded the rest of that paragraph tells me otherwiseill make this easy for you to understand in eve numbers matter a lot in general when two individual ships united together in combat against one ship are evenly matched the two ships are only marginally cheaper than the one if a carrier could tank 30 battleships all by itself then it should cost more than a titan as long as it only costs as much as a handful of battleships people who can fly carriers would almost exclusively fly carriers since they would almost never lose themas it stands a carrier has several times the tank of a tier3 battleship it should probably cost at least 50 times as much simply by virtue of its fleet combat value
you didnt get that one either fair enough since it appears english is not a primary language for youhis use of i in that translation was a semi mocking way of implying that is what you meant by the statement you made
while reeding the csm summit minutes i was seeing concern on keeping a diverse selection on the counsil so being a noob i hope im not being ignorant in saying this i think it might be nice to have csms elected as a sort of senate each canidate will aplly for a particular style of play if im correct there are 15 spots im think there are enough spot to ensure every style of the game is be coverd industry faction warfare pvp  a represemtative for low and high may be one for both wormhole and new players maybe in my ignorance it seems simple but i think if players were able to look at a few canidates they knew were going to rep their game style votes and vote quality would go up having said that i only listed 5 aspects of eve obvioulsy some one with more game knowladge than me will have to expand on them but i think it would ensure a stable csm
i actually like it and 5 d be ok but id put em like thishigh seclow secnullwormholeeconomy mining manufacturing trading exploration missions in other word carebearingso for each topic we can choose 3 players and yeah csm btw them should choose the chairman
this has been suggested many times before the problem is distinguishing csm candidates into their appropriate subjectsif a nullsec resident wants to run as a highsec representative how do you stop that what qualifications would allow some and disallow others that nullsec resident may have never set foot in highsec but he can just as easily claim his alts have or even run as his altits a neat idea and one we really need but proper implementation doesnt existsummary of eves last four expansions
obviously but it shouldnt be that hard to create a version of ring mining that doesnt provide tech but still gives the hisec folk a chance to see what its about even if you did leave tech in at say 10 of a low or null version given the current state of tech markets would that really be a bad thing yes itd provide a highsec souce of tech but an incredibly small one and besides it doesnt appear ring mining will be afk friendly and thats all we high secers are right afk bots pbottomline when it comes to new features like this im not saying give high sec a seat at the table but toss a few scraps our way
people actually still do stuff for money in hisecethere already exists a venue where you can sample pretty much anything you want anywhere you want skills permittingits called the singularity testserver more commonly sisias for the rest of the ophow aboutno110next
actually thats incorrect if you merely point your probes at hisec moons minerals are there its the extraction array anchoring restriction that stops us from getting at them
my point is that this logic only will draw in those willing to take high risk for moderate rewards there are common complaints about lowsec being too steep of an increase in risk for a marginal increase in rewards any edge taken off that risk will increase the amount of people in lowsec that is another complaint too few people in lowsec solosmall gang pvpers need to ask for more challenging victims failure to take their needs and survival rates into account has led us to where we are people want to get out there but the risks vs reward needs rebalancing mindsets need to change

had some trouble coming up with a suitable title for this ideaas always keeping it short and sweetwhen i click on show info on a member i would really like to be able to modify the members corporation details from the same window as well as the edit member option on right clicksubmitted for your review
bumpnobody thinks this is a good idea
this speaks volumes on how much you listen to your voters
hi allim going to be short and dry altough i an old player i am by no means a wealthy playereach time i get podded its 30m to buy a new clone i mean that is a lot of money for me and i honestly avoid some pvp because of itwill you tell me that the best thing is to roll a pvp alt cause its cheaper when you die realy realy that is a hell of a game mechanicdo something about these prices
dont get me wrong im not against the idea but perhaps some additional detail would be in orderwho would be moving in and under what reasoning linewhat would they offer to attract peopleetctheres certaintly a few factions that could fill the gap but for the proposal to carry weight it needs detail
terrible idea the penalty for podding is a sec status hit now your proposing the survivor usually the aggressor gets to salvage what could potentially be 125 billion or more in implants i see toons with absolutely no impulse controll all the time getting themselves richer by simply creating a toon capable of ganking a highsec miner then turning 10 to 20 of the value of an intact barge now a wreck into another ship to rinse and repeat give those same toons the idea that they can hit the motherload and you will find shuttle wrecks all over empire as toons try to win the lottery all players know that the isk spent on implants is lost as soon as you plug it in lesson sec status hit does not supress missed ritalin doses the possibility that over a billion isk can be gotten from a pod is already in place it is called the bounty systemthings that keep me up at nightUFFFD why do we use a voice communication device to send telegraphs moores law should stateUFFFDonce you have paid off the last pc upgrade you will need another
thats reason they dont let us salvage implants
hehe true i thought about the office time also dd spent in a quality manner
this is one of the better ideas ive seen for fleshing out the cq a little and to integrate something that can be quite useful would be awesomemarket feeds could be added with a reasonable delay so that it isnt constantly locking up as welli am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
i can definitely understand people saying there are more important issues in the game when i see my nightmare bisect an abaddon on leaving a station lol not much we can do about that i dont mind it really it is unique the way it worked in station before cq was the background image of the station did not float it only moved in response to you moving your camera around and you could spin your ship all day but the station was rock solid the only thing that floated then was your ship what we saw then was real 3dsomehow someone messed up the code and when they did everything started floating together
crap now i see it this is a case of what has been seen cannot be unseenhowever i can live with it since they are going to eventually redo station hanger environments they can get to it then
you made me smile and laugh stop that i have to be serious or i might get blown up and yeah its not that bad anyway
1its been a problem for years so im not optimistic that ccp will do anything about it
5 for me ceo and past alliance industrial directorthis one issue is a major bar to recruitment into corps and also hurt newbies from getting in the better indy corpsto those who say ccp is not listening check out the section of discussion on corp revam
this is an excellent idea implement it as is right now moar pvp
in what way
1has the csm cared to reply to this thread i know they have dev and gm tags but i dont remember seeing thread tags for csm or isdcan we get some kind of communication from the csm about this
ccp please read this is the kind of thing you need to do to make lowsec more popular not destroy it even morethese are ideas collected from various places some mine many others make lowsec a place not just a crap mechanic
please do something about this it mainly affects the incursion community but would have affects elsewhere like with the war cool downs basically what people have been doing is wardeccing small corps who do incursions with alts which have just enough skils to dec someone or is an alt they are not planning on using for that week for example ready for chaos is deccing my corp and its only member is the ceo which has been in that corp for 30 days the point of these decs is not to go to war its more to cause problems with communities which are vulnerable to space aids the incursion community didnt care about these corps until someone used the existing 1 man corp notifications to slip in a much larger corp please do something about this my suggestion would be to require a min number of non trial characters before you can wardec something small like 5
one man corps already got hit pretty hard by the inferno changes its really not that hard to shut down a one man corp also you might want to post a solution rather than omg do something
i did post a solution my suggestion would be to require a min number of non trial characters before you can wardec something small like 5and how would you go about shutting one of these down
your solution was contained in a single sentence of the post and was also terrible so i didnt really count it as a solutionas to how to shut them down shoot the guy set a trap if youre really lazy and feel like spending your time camp him in station the bottom line is if you get all tied up in how much iskhr youre losing by camping him or chasing after him youre going to lose its your choice not to pursue him if your corporations members feel that they should off making money instead just dont be surprised when he picks you off one by one
vulnerability should be limted to 100after all its not possible to make a system more stablethe idea being once vulnerable the system needs to be flipped quickly before its defendedno lp for offensive plexing an already vulnerable system
the problem with your proposal dear nerois that the carrier already costs as much as 10 battleships but it cant tank 10 battleships without triage or spider tanking awesomeness nor can it attack anything smaller than a bs without much difficulty or waiting 2 years to target something dont get me started on warping out or after something compared to the bsflawed argument is flawedand while were talking about numbers that mean allot the sheer lack of approvals and or likes attributed to you or your ideas indicate a severe lack of understanding or buy in from the masses
cost of production is almost never a limiting factor supercarrier and titan proliferation proved this all too wellwhat will happen is that you raise the bar for a small entity to get a carrier or dreadnought while doing nothing to curb their mass production by larger entities
there is no force people solo mine and pvp in lowsec all the time it does work better if you work with a group or at least backup to call inthat said sitting in a paper thin shell of a ship where any one is allowed to come in and shoot you is a bad ideaalso imho and experience nullsec is safer than lowsec the group i worked with at the time showed up faster than concord when i needed help my lowsec experiences were less pleasant
yeah i dont think anyone cares too much about the mining bonuses one way or another make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
yeah i read that yesterday my one concern was that it was a single paragraph explaining the problem but no comment from ccp if they acknowledgeagreed or such i hope it gets more attention
if you dont want to be war decked then move to the noob npc corpor join a bigger corpor deffend yourselfdont come crying to the forums with poorly thought out ideas that are simply a brainfart response to what change can i make that makes my specific situation saferjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
a single week old character who doesnt even log on can bring an entire incursion running corpalliance to its kneesgosh you incursionbears are worse at eve than i thought
wow afk cloakers are killing nullsec oneman wardecs are killing incursions gankers are killing minerspretty soon all that will be left is the alliances that can see to their own security the wspace crowd that wonder what this local thing is and highsec griefers
i fail to see how this is a bad thing
grow some balls
it would be fair to allow it to be pushed just past vulnerable otherwise the first minor would decontest it should not need to be more than 105 or sostill feel the emphasis should be on forcing a conclusion to the contested status that could mean and increase in the rewards for capture starting taken systems at a higher default upgrade level thanultimately system capture should be an event that should not go unopposed this possibly means an objective for the defender when the structure bashing begins if it is reppeddefended enough then the defenders get rewards and a  chunk is taken of the contested state probably not back to zero though
this makes sense some small buffer so that when you come in with the big ships to hit the bunker the other side doesnt just run a minor plex but the italics part i do not understand why force a conclusions to vulnerable status it is what will allow militias to hit tier five if we have to immediately flip systems the small amount of strategy and planning for the big flipping stage is eliminated and plexing becomes a constant grind where both sides will be lucky to hit tier 3 or 4 for example i tend to think that when one side decides to start flipping systems there will be large scale fights it may not happen for amarr minmatar when amarr ultimately flips systems but that would be because of the null sec entities on the amarr side the minmatar might not have the larger ships to bring but usuallly i think we will find their will be more fights than there was when we just flipped systems immediately make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i thought about having vulnerability a small amount above 100if the vulnerability is ever above 100 including right now on tq it should be visible to everyonehowever im not sure the buffer makes sensehaving to think about managing the plexes while hitting the bunker seems like a good thing to meand the wiki seems to suggest this is how its intended to work
good idea
i agree theres something wrong with system control mechanics atm however because i currently dont have a well thought out idea ill let ccp think about it first we need to make them aware of the problem
hello allwell i can already sense the posts that may come but maybe there will be some positive onesliving in 00 yes can be a little risky etc but there are somethings in eve that are not right like being able to push one button and you can litterly lose alot of assets even for some years and years of work yes just one click and thats itwhat i am taking about is  kick memberscorps andor disbanding alliances if a corp gets kicked from a 00 sov alliance that owns stations their assets are locked there forever could be loads and loads of ships for lots of different members yes there may have bene a legit reason they got kicked but there is also people who lick to just kick corps for no reason and all this takes is one director to click one button really again when bob got disbanded took only one person to do that and years of work down the drain is this really rightonce kicked you are locked out of any stations etc to get your assets yes you could try get your assets out by paying an insider but in all honesty you are probably going to get scammed or blown up in the process rather than finding an honest person should many people lose some much with such an easy action i dont believe sono i am not saying i have the answer to this but surely this needs to be looked at i know some people may also state keep your assets in npc stations yes of course do that but there are also needed in main bases too be interested to get your thoughts even though i probably know what to expecthopefully we can get some adult answers
im not a nullsec resident so this is an honest question shouldnt you be able to set up courier contracts to get the stuff out that way you could secure it with collateral and have it moved to an npc stationyou might want to look into having whichever frog service runs nullsec shipments see if they could get it out they seem to have a fair bit of access
afaik black frog is only in the initial phase of negotiating with sovholders for station access
yes black frog even with alliances that have blue standings dont currently enter 00 sov stations be good if that could be sorted
there should be like a 10 20 or 30 day period that you could remove your stuff after being notified of the expulsion
this and ratings boards such as the esrb would need to review the changes tobacco use and possibly even change the age rating of the game depending plus these ratings are not free i like the idea but the hassle associated with it would be extreme
i support thisi think fw mechanic is broken
rib how many times has an afk cloaker killed youhow many times has an afk cloaker done something that prevented you from going about your businessprotip the answer is 0
super simple but effective there are many people that go afk in eve and pretty much type afk in a channel to show this obviously people that come in later dont see this message we have offline and online lights can we have another light that we can set manually amber or blue to denote we are afkalso when this is set and we convo people we are not sat there waiting for ages for them to reply or them waiting for us a simple message to state the user is afk would be really usefuland quite easy to implementedit  this should be a manual setting set by the user
not so stealthy cry about cloakies threadcounter proposal no htfu if you want intel on how active another player is or what theyre doing go out and work for it instead of begging for hand outs dscan probes covering entrancesexits etc
this is whats wrong with this game people like you with some intense paranoia this has got nothing to do whatsoever about afk cloaking rubbish what the the hell are you talking about this is basically putting something in place to show you are afk and also the people who trying to contact you know you are afk thats it if you want to look at it with some paronoid metagaming facility then you do that
oh please dont pretend this isnt about cloakies for people youre trying to contact ha know how you know if theyre afk they dont respond simple
seriously its notbut if you want to keep on thinking that then hey you do that also i would prefer when i come back from afk that i dint have lots of convo windows too also why would i be bothered if it was about detecting afk cloakies im not anyway that wouldnt even serve a purpose even if i did know a cloakie was afk i still wouldnt be able to find him so there would be no point so seriously think about what you are saying before just trolling
well if this was about afk cloakies rather than a none existing issue about knowing whether the person youre talking to is afk you  ahem i mean not you since you super duper definitely arent talking about cloakies  would know when someone in local isnt a threat allowing all the mining missioning and other carebearing to be done in absolute safety i think coding a mechanic to tell you that the person who isnt responding to you may not be there to respond to you offers so little benefit to begin with that it isnt worth the time and money but when you throw in the fact that it breaks certain mechanics or metagaming which you so definitely absolutely arent really talking about nope no way then its not even up for debate its a big fat nope
lets settle this argument with a simple idea make the away status a toggle option not automatic there now you can be afk and pretend not to be while legit people who are afk can still let the world know
exactly what he said  even if it wasnt designed to test for afk cloakies thats how it would be usedalso i dont want other players to know whether or not im at my computer sometimes i just dont want to talk to people and i dont want to have to explain why im ignoring them as opposed to being afk
oh ofc this is a manual setting not automatic apologies if his wasnt clear i will update original post
again apologies if not clear this was supposed to be totally a manual setting not some mechanic to detect if you are afk basically i want an option that i can set manually to tell people i am afk again this suggestion has nothing to do to detect afk cloakers
my support on this one i havent been in faction warfare for long but its clear to me that the element i actually signed up to fw for is not thereon a side note the whole way its evolved to an lp dump once every 2nd week i dunno how often and rest of the time not giving a  about the system makes it all pointless to me i want to help conquer systems and hold them but nobody cares about the systems when its not time for the dump
so what is proper implementation a test in my mind i would say eventualy with players reading things like the csm minutes someone would catch on to a poser may be even the other csms would be able to spot them also especialy if there are other people on the csm with similar specialties this i think would then tie in to another topic they brought up how do you then remove a member or would this even qualify as having need to be removed
i understand where people are coming from on this however i disagree with making boosters only work on grid since the removal of unprobeablilty t3 boosters have become increasingly vulnerable to combat they have very week tanks and arnt that hard to catch i feel that most people are whining because they have been killed by someone with a booster and thus try to use it as an excuse for being bad at pvp if someone brings a boosted 100mn tengu into your system undock a webbing loki problem solved in my opinion having a booster in a pos gives the owning corpalliance a homefield advantage to people trying to come into their system and blob them if you fly smart boosters are easily countered people are just stupid and get easily butthurt about some guy killing their lolfit fleets
100 agree with this putting boosters on grid will dumb the game too much off grid boodters should provide a bonus to the better prepared fleet if you cant probe them down because you dont have a scout with skills then too bad you deserve to be at a disadvantage for being unprepared
it wont at allccp please drop the sentry gun ideas you had expressed in the minutes they are terribleimplement the op instead make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
i agree with this its too difficult to find good fights in lowsec because everyone is afraid to loose their sec status or gcc
i like the idea but im afraid lowsec will need a lot more intention than thatfor example1 with otechighsec mission lp etc compared to lowsec isk income vs risk is very unbalanced in favor of risk just no reason to go into lowsec an proposal to fix that could include more researchmanufacturingexplorationmining options that would increase lowsec viability2 another idea could be pirate fw have piratesoutlaws side up with one of the existing npc factions guristas angels serpentis etc for bonussesstuffjust some ideas i like that the barrier needs to be lowered for lowsec but the problem has grown bigger then merely sec status or the recent hassle over sentry guns
counter signed1
unbelivable noone has an opinion on that i am not even getting trolled some feedback would be nice
1 this would really help lowsec thrive and bring more people into it
op is feeling threatened by a oneman corp wow
quick everyone make one man corps and dec him
make friends recruit allies higher a merc itUFFFDs one guyUFFFD one merc is all you need
ever heard of the watchlist
apparently not
they already did dont you pay attention inferno increased the cost of wardeccing a corp to a way larger sum than 2 million isk whether its working or not is entirely up to you if its just one guy just fight back
ahemone man should not be able to slow you down and if you are ignoring wardecs because its a bunch of one man corps then you and everyone in your corp is pretty brain damaged from shooting too many red crossesits a community of people who are able to fly the best subcaps in eve at a high level of skillsp that is if you get wardecced use the happy new ally system to bring more firepower from those legendary destroyers of sansha to bear on anyone who does the new wardec system favors you to such an extreme already that you dont need any more help other than maybe a life coach
my ideas standalone or combined whatever suits your fancy limit it to 100 period no buffer no nothing  the beauty of the system flip portion of fw is that all hull sizes are theoretically required so one cannot merely drop bs and be assured a flip fw is all about the plex fights  doesnt prevent people from slugging it out on the bunker but it should not be the only option add some way for an attacker to determine which plexes can spawn postvulnerable state could be three external modules on bunker itself one for each size plex  when vulnerable two can be disabled by brute force or hacking disable one and it accelerates the spawn frequency of the remaining two sizes disable two and the remaining size plex has triple spawn frequency adopt pay out system from incursions  any lp gained during siege is paid out when job is done not before if people want lp here and now they can bloody well do missions add high tracking destructible sentries to all plexes balance their ehpdps to encourage bringing the right shiptool for the plex and purge the gunless frigs people so enjoy chasing defensive timer count downwards resets automatically with no enemy near to actually capture plex a defender still needs to be present  25 of plex lp is added to upgrade pool provided there is some missing ie has been taken out by hostile plexing adopt constellationwide conflict system from incursions and have it offer meaningful stuff not available elsewhere ie systems still have individual upgrade trees keep wzc mechanic as system upgrade cost modifier only circumvents the rather large imbalance caused by geography especially on the mataramarr front  ever tried plexing in earnest behind dal choke point meaningful stuff could be  availability of lp store items with list only being fully populated if all systems in constellation are fully upgraded removes the ability to go on shopping sprees right there in the trench under siege and adds some logistics to the mix as one must presume most front line constellations will be lacking an upgrade level or two increased lp payouts from killing the enemy in constellation the more fortified upgraded it is increased effect of defensive plexing more vp not lp in constellation the more fortified upgraded it is increased npc spawns in plexes in constellation the more fortified upgraded it is increased lp from offensive plexing in constellation the more fortified upgraded it is  a carrot has two ends and one is pointy add you own unfortunately i doubt youll get more than the first entry bug squash as the power that be are apparently quite happy with fw as is so much promise endless possibilities  cry  geography issue try to count the maximum number of jumps needed to reach the deepest system on either side of the kourmonenauga and ezzaravard gateways  now check how many chokepoints are in either direction as well as highsec adjacents and what empire holds said adjacentsthe gallentecaldari spat was kicked off with the introduction of an entire region black rise designed specifically for the purpose as caldari had no lowsec to speak of  devs made do with existing space for the mataramarr theatre as both had plenty of lowsecanyhoo toodles  back to setting up my overview new pc o
make your proposal clear that you just want the lp to end at vulnerable and a cap to the amount it can be contested and i will support it i think allot of fw players will support it make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
we can look at the entire starmap and just the solar system map how about a map that only shows the systems in the region youre in
currently all races have their unique ammo types governmentissued versions of those ammo types are superior and prized in pvphowever hybrid ammo is issued by both gallente and the caldari and theres no difference in the two except the name the markets generally favor the caldari navy ammunition with cheaper prices because there tends to be more caldari mission runnersproposal grant each type of ammo a minor and unique bonus to differentiate the two federation navy ammo gets a minor  5 bonus on tracking caldari navy ammo gets a minor  5 bonus on optimal rangereasoning a tracking bonus better suits the federation approach of closeup blaster brawls optimal range bonuses support the caldari approach of ranged combat variety is good
i like this
over the years eve has become easier and easier  this is not a point of making the game harder but making it somewhat more interestingthis idea has be put forth here a few times making all racial regions have contested space between them even amarr and caldarisanashas nation can currently contest high secso why couldnt a few pirate nations live between empires in less secure spacethe pirate factions all ready dont like the empire factions and a few of their opposing factions for them to gain more power they was want more space empire has it not inferring of removing current high sec systems a region could be added as they did for fwthis could also include some low end pirate missions within the systems pirates would be primarily in space make use of em in space agents some more this would not only make you have the risk of travailing between systems for doing the missions but also landing on other people running missions turning in missions or people looking for a fightthis would allow more price fluxes between region to region in regarding prices due to the fact freighters cant go everywhere now unless they escorted by yourself or friends so you would need scouts and someone to web to get into warp faster to make a safer route through low sec between regionsi am myself currently and have been mostly high sec my time in eve yet i would like to see these changes to make the game more interesting for myself and others
jump freighters would help there  but your point still stands for the most parti like it
yeah jfs would be a lot more commonmore routes between the races space would be nice so a pirate group cant camp a few systems to halt all movement between space
prices are already skyrocketing to way above your proposed levels due to mineral costs a carrier alone now costs around 14b theres no need to make them more expensive then they already are when you factor in the prices of capital modsfighters a fit carrier costs over 2b thats a huge margin compared to the 250m it costs to fit a battleship
should have been done years ago were it to be changed now youd essentially hand current capital owners a huge wad of cash as the market value spikes and unduly penalize all future prospective capital pilotsmuch more sense to limit what they can do andor where they are of use lots of talk about various cyno restrictions and similar soft changes that could potentially have a huge impact on howwhenwhere caps are used probably easier not as much forum rage to change mechanics than ships at any rate so there
yes its broken but this proposal will just break it into even smaller pieces make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
this is good it gives people farmers a reason to defend systems

just because pirates arent unified and loud we have been ignored for way to long piracy should be a real option not just a hobby for hardcore pvpersi love pretty much all the ideas suggested there except i think pirate ships should be  shot down in high sec im sick of seeing people grinding missions in pirate ships 
overlords of the lowsec system could get access to certain missions in that system black markets should have taxation the tax should go to the overlordi dislike the pleasure hub ideacyno jam  no the only way of moving caps around is by using lowsec systems unless you want to jump into hostile nullsec space if every lowsec system with an overlord gets cyno jammed how are we going to move our caps aroundcav
i think a lot of ideas from dotlans site should be used in game if youve never been there it is great its functionality puts the pretty eve ingame map to shame
you could just sell it all have a fire salemost of the time the marker in nullsec is barren you could easily set up contracts and sell orders even after youve been kicked in fact its actually rather profitable to fly out in a cloaky start buying low and reselling high the difficulty in logistics mean nullsec players get boned in market transactionsyou could easily break even just selling your stuff and buying new things somewhere elsesummary of eves last four expansions
i could be wrong on some points but this is my understanding there are only two ways you lose access to goods in a station 1 if you have items in a corp hangar and the corps office is unrented all corp hangar items goes into impound once impounded only directors can access it to access it the director must pay to release the items and only has the option to do so when they have permission to rent an office in short if a stations controlling corp denies your corp rental privileges you cannot access impounded items however since the owners cant actually unrent your office you should always have a window to get your stuff out of corp hangar before you lose access to it note a director of your corp could unrent your office thereby instantly creating inaccessible items so chose our directors carefully 2 the station controlling corp can deny docking rights to a station this does not mean you lose your items you can still remotely contract them and remotely sell them on the market if you are in the station you can also load up your valuables and try to sneak them out yes your access to the station is severely limited as once you undock you cannot redock note if you have a lot of items in a station its always good to leave a jump clone there as you can always jc back into station for one last load of items as to the op there are two 1click methods to lose your outpost items instantly a you have a spy director that unrents your corp office in an outpost where you cant rerent the times b your docking rights to a station are revoked like perhaps you get kicked from a corp or unblued is it really unreasonable that you lose access to your stuff it sucks but most of the time you have forewarning with the exception of impounded items you also have the ability to recuperate some of your losses firesales courier contracts etc losing assets drives wonderful evacuation events and reclaiming inaccessible assets is a great driver for conflict ie youre more likely to help shift the tides and reclaim the station i dont really see why this should go away in my opinion impounded items could use a rework but i dont see any reason to give access to regular player hangar items made inaccessible by an outposts controlling corp as for impounded items id like them to become open to theft by the stations controlling corp perhaps after some impound time period
there already is a way conquer the station if your corp got kicked out of the alliance join a hostile alliance and take it all back even if it takes years thats eve
i have encountered serious problems with the beacons that form the basis of warpin points for missions and complexestwo examples that highlight some fundamental difficulties with themscenario 1i am in a hurricane hunting war targets in highsec using a neutral alt i scout down a missioning tengui neatly put my alt 10km away from the stationary tengu jump in with the hurricane and click warp to 0 to my alt i fly across the entirety of the system giving ample warning to the target who fails to warp off before i land rather than land neatly on my alt at 0 i am dragged 70km away to a warpin beacon giving the tengu ample time to warp awayscenario 2i am hunting a target through a plex in 00 in my pilgrim having played afk cloaky wossname for a week to give him time i deftly maneuvre through dozens of large collidable objects and his own wrecks stopping 2200m off the acceleration gate towards him so i can activate it without being decloaked in the sure and certain knowledge hell be spamming dscani warp in without decloaking until unavoidably and arbitrarily i am decloaked by the warpin beacon i had no hope or ability to avoid its pot luck as to whether you land within 2000m or not and are decloaked by itproposal1 end the tyranny of the warpin beacon in dragging you off your designated warpin where there is no acceleration gate to block your path allow people to make use of decent scouting to get decent warpins on targets2 stop beacons from arbitrarily decloaking covert ships either terminate their decloaking properties give players a chance to avoid them or ensure that they always decloak you when you warp in i favor the former
supported
considering that beacons were added specifically to decloak ships entering through acceleration gates i am not sure there is much merit in your proposal put 70km range on your hurricane or perhaps consider bumping the target with your alt to buy time to close rangeyou want free ganks handed to you on a platter no thanks
can you give me a link to evidence for your first assertion if true then its been executed poorly as its more or less random as to whether you are decloaked or notsecondly it is hardly a free gank there are two possibly three opportunities for the carebear to avoid losing their ship to a war target when missioning during war time  which frankly they shouldnt be doing anywaya keep an eye out for combat scanner probes on dscan especially using dscan range to identify when they are scanning you specificallyb pay attention to local and dock when a war target enters localc use shortrange dscan to identify when something is about to warp in on youincompetent carebears are incompetent
hang on put 70km range on a hurricane how to tackle with hurricane at 70kmalso bumping would reveal the neutral alt or friend doing the scouting rendering them useless as a neutral scout for the rest of the warkthxbai
part of the mission is to force the player to cover a certain range that they cant avoid do they still block a mwd its like a physical obstacle meant to make the mission take longer otherwise the mission runner would do something like what you did this also means that his hunter has the same problemnot all missions work this way youll just have to catch him on one of those you also can wait for him to come back to the warp point better yet let him salvage through a few areas wait for him at the warp in point of the last area and surprise attackthis also is a good time to attack someone else from the war target corp if he warps out to support them you can be waiting for him when he warps back with his mission shipthis also is a case where long range can be useful you need a ab tackler and possibly a heavy tackler then warp in with a long range bs it takes a two man team light tackler switches to a bs but it could work yes 70k is a lot of ground to cover but he cant get that far if you watched him leave his station and pursue soon aftermy point is you can get to your target if you use tactics over game mechanics that are working as intended if you want to hunt him in a mission you have to deal with the mission too
anyone remotely competent and paranoidat warin lowsecetc jettisons a can or three as soon as they warp into a new mission area to decloak people put it in the hands of the players
everyone knows why would be disturb the afk tag some cloaky snip who lying in the forum im afk at enemy systems and i cant kill anyone when im afk because they would be lost the chances to terrorizing active players in afkits time to create something what is should be change this bad game mechanic where a cloaker can hide in enemy system and can went out from his pc 23 hours time long without riskrisk free afk cloaking its a bad game mechanicthe cloak not need cap or fuel usage easy to going to work and left behind the cloaked ship at the enemy system in afk because no one can scanning them no one can catch themneed solution for handling this capacitor useage for cloak or fuel usage counter ship seek and destroy or afk tagedit i have already had to edit previous posts of yours for this kind of language please desist from this kind of behaviour in future and abide by the forum rulesslurs removed  isd type40
fine but in exchange you must give me a way to enter a system and be able to hunt down the people in it before they all scurry away and hide for hours on end til i leave or am destroyed instantly knowing that there is a potential threat in a system and being able is hide without risk is both a bad mechanic and bad gameplay until local is addressed learn to deal with the problem i hear teamwork does wonders

personally i would like to see a new destroyer class when they rebalance those to include a dedicated cloak hunting shipwith a special probe launcher and probes to be able to locate cloaked ships and an aoe weapon that would decloak them in say a 5km radiusthis would however not be able to work on the cloak abilities that come from gate jumping
you realise any idea that allows you to find or decloak cloaked ships is utterly awful right it would be catastrophic for wormhole spaceand why do you need to find a cloaked ship anyway they cant do anything
1supportedneed counter against afk cloakers 247 afk cloaking unacceptable and cap usage or cap fuel usage would be nicesomehow must fix cloak advantages when someone not playing just break economics thats same when someone dont go to work but want
inherently flawed analogy as there is no paycheck when afk you cannot earn isk or performgain anything to your advantage while afk cloaked afk cloakers also do not break economics  they are doing nothing they cant make isk they cant destroy isk they cannot do anything
afk cloaker break game economics dont lie easy and possible terrorize peoples without playing because no counter against afk cloakers tadam is right when he said thats same advantage if the pilot is not playing but get advance against other players without playingthe ratter cant go out to make isk because that is very dangerous when a cloaker in the system and noone know who afk or not when no afk tagno ship type detection and other thing forget your troll in this topic you just spamming the topic with your trolling
firstly i do not appreciate the constant ad hominem i am explaining the issues and my stance in a civil manner repeatedly calling me a liar screaming troll or flat out using bigoted attacks do not help your case anyhow i am not lying afk cloakers do not themselves do anything to the economy at all your claim that the ratters cant go out to make isk is incorrect there is nothing stopping them from going out and making isk they are perfectly capable of ratting and mining and whatever elseing all day long however they chose not to thats fine that is their prerogative but to blame other players  players who arent even actually playing as they are afk  for the actions of others is dishonest and cowardly
please ban thegunslinger42 from this topic he just ruin all forum topics with his continous trolling and personal attacks without constructive answers
not the local is the real problem the bad cloak mechanics is the problem if ship can cloak 247 hours long
it may be worth pointing out that a cloaky pilot in any null sec system is of less risk than any cloaky pilot in any inhabited wormhole system whyin the wormhole system you cant see there is a redneut in system so you dont have the information to avoid the risk  so what you do instead is have friends online to deal with it for you these friends are called cloaked falcons or rapiers or any other combat ship under the starswant to be able to mine solo without friends then go to hisec buy the new procurer and afk mine your life awayafk cloakers annoy me too but you have to understand the way to deal with them is not to remove them from the game it is to develop a viable defence strategy to neutralise them this strategy is a combination of permabubbles active gate camps scouts and beefing up the toons guarding you in the beltsrecently a dev blog stated that the recent changes were to allow miners to make meaningful choices before undocking in null sec these choices have been around for ages
i do nothing but provide valuable insight and constructive criticism we wormhole dwellers have adapted and found ways to deal with cloaky enemies after all  and it is a far harder task for us as we do not have powerful intel tools such as local you are free to disagree with me but attempting to censor me and using multiple npc corp alts to yell troll is far more in the realm of ruining discourse by spewing personal attacks trolling and an overall lack of meaningful or constructive contributions
u need to adapt to afk cloaking because it is broke and if something is broke it needs to eb fixed any advantage u can get by not being at your pc should be addressed and i mean being 247 afk not on your comp and shutting whole systems sucks hard
what advantage do you get while afk cloaked do you get isk do you get kills do you do anything the answer of course is no afk cloakers do not in fact can not shut down a system the residents of that system shut it down themselves again do not blame the afk player for someone elses the minersrattersetc actions
yes you see the problems and i know balex players is experienced players like djukaskreso cakija or babaroga tooafk cloakers get advantages to terrorize active players and break economics without play advantages without play its unfair against active players
honestly coming from both cloaky camping and being cloaky camped the simple was to stop a cloaky camper is teamwork rat in fleets or better yet rat somewhere else if someone is cloaky camping you and is in cyno range then you can obviously return the favor or use it to your advantage to set a trap there isnt anything wrong with cloaky camping either get some friends or move your precious ratting ship a system over
its simple not trutheasy to make for the big alliances with 8k players some cloaker alts and infect enemy system with afk cloaker alts where could go a npc ratter when all their system infected with afk cloaker alts  god bless us when the goons will starting this tactics and ruin all enemy systemimpossible defend all systems in same time and sometimes the activity is too low to risk ratting and your idea is stupid what you told to move other place when the ratting systems in 00 need permits and sometimes a renter just have few system and why give advantages for afk players against the active players why the active players need to move out against afk players  the game mechanic is broken more and more systems infected by afk cloakers who not doing anything else dont collect intel just trying to make economic damage with inactive playing
i agree that afk cloakers reign of terror needs to come to an endto accomplish this i fully support removing local from lowsec and null so that you will be ignorant of his presence and carry on your activities as normalany other solutions are not supportedgood day
go to wh if you dont need localremove local give more huge advantages to cloakers that not supportedeven the afk tag is better than remove local
1 if the afk tag was applied to everyone not just cloakers i might consider this however imo this is taking intel in the wrong direction we dont need more instant intel on people we need lessi personally want local set to wh delayed mode and for ccp to actually create an intel tool  system have it quickly alert you to the presence of a new pilot in space but hide their identity  ship type until they are within recon range ie you dont instantly know if the new local is friend or foe but you moreless instantly know there is a new person in local the recon range of ships could depend on your ship typeattributes their ship typeattributes skills modules and of course the distance between you two finally have intel automatically shared with fleet members in system this is much better than giving away even more free intel which we already have wwwaaaaayyyy to much of as is 2 any cloaky hunting mechanics should not hinder cloakers safely traveling through a gate camp or you essentially nerf the primary function of a covert cloak into uselessness
this is the main problem with this cloaking system
so when i am ratting trying to grind isk to fund my pvp habit every time a new local enters system i need to dock up and go grab a pvp ship to try and find out who they even are while at the same time they warp off  cloak and now i have no idea what they are inuntil ccp makes ratting in groups more profitable in 00 it wont happen people are too concerned with their iskhr ratiosnow if there is an option for a system upgrade to be able to provide direct intel on someone jumping in i may be more for that i dislike the afk cloak type but as others have said either move on to a different system or find something else to do until they get bored so in short i am saying no to your proposal
you act like goons dont already use this tactic at some point or another you eventually get to the point where you either grow some balls and rat or tell ccp to completely remove cloaking because removing cloaking is totally viable due to npc ratters not making the most of their situation which is more than likely a nomadic lifestyle anyways the other option for renters is to pack their bags and rent from somewhere else or simply rat in groups like i said earlier i here test has some yummy space theyre selling out
the advantage u get is distrupting others game by not being on your computer the residents in the system can never know if the cloaky is afk or not and any even a bit smart guy want go ratting when he knows there is a possible hot drop so when one alliance deployes to attack another the attackers shut every single system with afk ppl that is a pretty big advantage for someone not being on his comp
i agree with optoo much of a good thing is bad cloaky 247 is bad but make them decloak occasionally to enjoy some risk by either adding a timer or some energy mod that will time down by using up cap or something after a few hoursthere are many ways to make the module stop working after a few hours these annoying cloaky ships need to be regulated a bit for game balancethey can decloak and kil you solo  or they can scout you down and call their friends to kill youand thats absolutely fine but  cloaking becomes abusive if they sit there 247 because you cant even scan them down to kill them backplease pick this up dear c s m  this cry for balance deserves some loving attention
the problem i see with afk cloackersthey are a potential threat they could have a cyno and just wait for you to let your guard down you dont know what they are doing they may be afk on a safe but they may also actively spyputting an afk cloacker into every enemy system threatening that system with a instant titan bridge or captital hot drop makes counter strategies hard to plan you can not defend all systems with full forcefor the wormholersyou can not threaten a wh system with hotdrops thats a big difference the potential force projection of a cloacky inside a wh is much less significanta potential solutionchange cloaking devices to not completely hide the ship just blurr the scannable signatureif it is on grid it remains invisible as it is nowif you attempt to scan it down instead of pinpointing the exact location you get an area where the cloacky is hidingyou can warp to that area and sweep it try to uncloack the ship maybe this could be a special role increase the decloack radius of a shipfor active cloackers that changes nothing they can just warp away if they see people warping to the area afk clocking on the other hand leaves you vounerable if someone takes the effort to sweep the area for you as it gives the search party plenty of time to find youafk cloaking in a fast moving ship still allows to find you as consecutive scans will reveal the movement vector of your ship the area moves and your speed it is much harder thoughscanning the system for the cloacker can at least give you intel on where he is spying allowing to determine if a cloacker is active or afkto allow strategic use of cyno cloakers if they are active i would suggest to implement a 5 min timer after a warp where you are unscannablethe lorecloaking ships can not circumvent the laws of physics especially thermodynamics a ship can only be completely hidden by storing the heat of their reactor inside the ship while warping you can vent the heat over a large area making it impossible to scan it down after you land the time you can remain invisible by only using internal cooling systems and heat storage is limited after that you have to vent the heat to the space around you a cloaking device can blurr the exact source of the heat and therefore your exact location but not that there is a heat source in the areai think that solution is more elegant than fuel or cap usage as it really adds a need for constant movement and action for the cloacky pilot that creates the feeling of actually doing something dangerous by spying in enemy space
lets go over the commonly proposed ideas for fixing afk cloaking and why they are mostly bad ideas1 cap usage for cloaks would make legitimate uses for cloaking a living nightmare especially scouts in cov ops there is no way to make this so that it would hinder afk cloakers without wreaking active cloakers2 fuel usage for cloaks would make usage of cloaks in hostile territory a mess on my last null roam i spent about 12 hours cloaked with only 1 station available to me for about 20 seconds as long as it took to get out of the system any mechanic of this sort to hinder afk cloakers woudl only hurt active cloakers more3 remove local this wont fix the problem wont really hurt cloakers that much by itself would make the ones who find issue with afk cloaking even more mad though4 anticloakcloak detecting sov item would make active cloaking near useless in sov systems removes a large portion of gameplay5 new ship to find cloakers this would be a mess for active cloakers and would require ccp to devote dev resources to making and balancing such a ship not the worst idea though6 afk tag this is not a bad idea for the most part only issue i see with it is that bots will become more viable in null if this was implemented i am hesitantly in support of something along these lines but for completely different reasonsthere are probably more potential fixes that only make things worse but i cant think of anymy opinion this is only an issue because people cant play when they might be at risk that is a personal issue spend time in whs for a few months and you learn to not care if someone is in local aside from the freakout when you enter a system and a bunch of stuff shows up on dscanedit the guy above me posted a very nice idea especially being able to vent the heat while warping this would allow a covops to run a while without worry venting every time they warpno matter my personal view on the subject i like that idea just from an immersion standpoint
a lot more profit could be made and some loss i like the idea
thisop i am with you in spirit but your proposed changes are no good this would just increase the barrier to entry as well as inflation
caps already have reduce insurance payouts to make killing them feel more worthwhile over other t1 hulls also their modules cost more also i can probably solo the ops battleship with a frigate so obviously frigates need to cost 200 million isk now
i dont agree with this either the price of caps has doubled over the last 6 months or so due to the mineral cost rise and they are still flowing out the production lines
i made a mistake in my last post i meant to say that two ships that make an even match for one would each individually cost much less total simply because there are two of themcarriers arent even made for tanking without triage they only tank well with triage and they damn well can tank 10 battleships when theyre feeding between one single other carrier and arent getting neuted compare that to 2 logistics cruisers repping each other against 10 frigatesthe frigates will destroy them and wont need neuts to do it but the 10 frigates cost much less than a logistics cruiserargumentum ad populummy number of likes received is only partially proportional to how much people like my ideas it also has a lot to do with how often i visit the forums the number of likes i have will never go away and if i make a post one day about dressing corpses and i get several hundred likes from it it wont increase my ability to make useful commentary on ships but i shouldnt even have to explain this to youshah fluffers wrotecost of production is almost never a limiting factor supercarrier and titan proliferation proved this all too wellwhat will happen is that you raise the bar for a small entity to get a carrier or dreadnought while doing nothing to curb their mass production by larger entitiesyour point is completely reasonable and definitely a major thing that will have to be considered when figuring out how to balance the resources it is not impossible by any means it simply hasnt been done right in the past i dont know the exact solution to the problem nobody does without trying and finding out but the best way to start would be to require capital ships cost materials that are limited in production by the number of players producing themsimilar to pi absolutely none of the necessary resources should be possible to control completely by one alliance or cartel this way any individual with enough net worth can cough up a capital shipi think that some resources should be somewhat controllable just to give something for big alliances to fight over but there should always be some resource bleed into the main population so that the little people can get their hands on it one method i thought of would be for moons to gradually deplete over the course of months and for other moons to sometimes grow into a new resource this way any alliance trying to control a resource say technetium would have to constantly keep an eye out for the new sources and wrest control of the systems that have it a small alliance could potentially find a technetium deposit on one of their moons and keep it a secret until they had stockpiled a good chunkyoure talking about a jump from battleship to capital ship so no its not
this could work if the defensive lp was donated directly to the infrastructure hub instead of the defenders walletdoing that would solve the problem of having alts in each militia plexing a system back and forth
okay folks keep the support going still working on the monolith but havent had time due to a recent war deci am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
completely agree with the op whspace is defined by living in the most remote challenging unforgiving places while getting great rewards on being an adventurer and truly being alone in space depending completely on yourself
by better prepared you mean people should have a scanning alt to find the boosting alts altsonline make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
more money for ccp that way why would they want to change it
it may seem like a good idea to basically require everyone to have alts logged in to pvp but i think this just turns people off from the game not to mention how eve will be a nonstarter for new players if it continues to foster a reputation that you need to play several alts to be competitive alt scouts alt boosters etc i think the alt haulers are ok because they can be one of your 3 characters on the same account but for things like boosters and scanning alts you need to buy multiple accounts this emphasis has to be hurting the game make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
hey vagabondsa number of you are missing the so called frills we had removed from the vagabond during the v3 process and i think itUFFFDs totally fair that i the art director give you an explanation why we did that and what our intentions visually are with the vagabond in the future eve is constantly under development and we in the art team look at the renovation process as an ongoing neverending task that we love to keep working on alongside the new assets we make every year some players donUFFFDt like to see to many changes made to their beloved ships but because of this the fidelity of the game after all these years is still hard to beat and eve keeps getting great reviews for the art every year however maybe the decision to remove the frill from the vagabond was taken too lightly and i didnUFFFDt realize how attached to the look of the ship you were to me as the art director the vagabond is a thukker version of the stabber but with brutor sails attached rather badly with intersecting polygons to the bridge area that make the ship look a bit silly but after giving it some thought i can understand the iconic appeal i think you should get your frills back in some way or the otherthat being said i always wanted to fix the old stabber up a little bit and give it some more love iUFFFDm not talking about a huge overall change to the ship but rather just balancing a bit the engine area and making some parts a little more believable this would of course give us a chance to give the vagabond some extra care and design the frills with thukker and some functionality in mind i already have stephan stUFFFDlting an amazing concept artist working on it and i promise to keep you posted about the development in the near future until we finish it you still have to live with a UFFFDno frillsUFFFD vagabondregards ccp huskarl
thank you thank you thank you
always nice to see ccp reacting to user feedback and already looking forward to brighter amarr ships
thank you i missed not seeing the space dragon
thank you i look forward to new and improved stabber class ships with some form and return to the iconic and traditional frills associated with the demon vagabondthanks for hearing us it means a lot
you knew they would start doing this as soon as rixx finished his vmf swag
ccp huskarl  best karllove your ccp name
1 for accountabilitythank you for listening and more importantly responding
great news im glad we were heard its been a fun tubthump and a great excuse for some community content next update how about removing engine trails for a laugh im sure thatd get an enthusiastic response and we could organise a weeklong sitin somewhere that serves beer notrailisfail
woot  o tbh im just elated over the fact that there was a thought about this and a response by devsccp the fact that it is being reviewed and possibly brought back in some iteration is just icing on the cake
and there was much rejoicing i am excited to see what you have in store
yeah   oh my i always hreally hated this part of the ship design hope ill like the new version xd
while i realize its in the works thank you so much for considering the feedback of your customers in this area  big props
this is great newsthank you for listening and responding as someone said before
thank you very much ccp for listening and replying to us 1
thanks ccp huskarl and thanks ccp for making contact with us now i know how roy neary felt when the aliens finally made contact at the end of close encounter of the third kind
thank you ccp huskarl for your post and assuring us crazy vaga lovers that their ships will once again be the space dragons of old in some fashion and thanks ccp overall for listening to our cries from the wilderness1 for space dragons
just had a word with my contacts at the tribe down in great wildlands and they confirm youre pretty cool for a caldarithank youps please also fix the manufacturer logos on the t2 versions
aaah but that would then require them to spend isk thus ruining their isk effeciencyits just easier for them to demand a change to help them p
op updated the jotunn risi are now recruiting brutor ancestry required in order to best represent the brutor interest join channel joris to learn more
i support this proposal proactively defending a system is already extremely difficult if no one lives there and the current mechanics just exacerbate the futile nature of defending nonstaging systems
nail on the head
i dont like how people assume its easy to cloak hunt in null secwhen you hunt you have 2 choices you can lurk a sport someone will come and investigate which means youll either a get tagged as afk by these changes or target wont rat mine plex what have yousecond you can roam solo going from system to system given the fact that anyone in system sees you enter they dock up or watch to see if you keep going on your merry way assuming your passing through if you spend any time beyond what it takes to get to the next gate guess what they dock upany changes to the system would render cloaking less useful unless they changed the basic rules of cloakingtarget timer penalty warping with less then covert ops impossible and speed penaltyyou cant reasonable change one aspect of the game without considering what you do to the others
yes this is the pure truthjust as i said earlier god bless us if a big alliance will starting this tactic and infect all solar systemsthats would be ruin the whole game and will bring huge economic catastrophe to playersa smart pilot knows when a cloaker in the system the threat is critical when he trying to move to ratting and he dont know the cloaker afk or not and dont forget sometimes the residents dont have enough active players in system to defendingso the pilots have two choices he moving out from infected system if he want to evade from danger zone or he risk what is not wise choicebut too easily infect all systems with cloaker alts and the pilot not have any chance to move other cloaker free systemthe other problem is if the residents move from underpopulated places to densely peopled system the other systems will be uninhabited and generate lag at the main hubs and dont forget the ratting place numbers is not limitlessthe real problem is the inactive players can cloaking 247 times long without playing this would need to change the other problem is the threat possibility from inactive players against active players what is huge advantage for inactive player and unfair game mechanics against active playersas the mining bots which get advantage without playing
protip if you want the rewards of rattingplexing in nullsec you must deal with the risks if you are unwilling to deal with the risk or to put in the effort to counter it then youre free to head straight back to hiseccloaking is fine as is stop being babies
i stopped reading when you said cloakies in wormholes are less of a threat you have no idea what youre talking about cloakies are far more of a threat in wormholes because you dont even know theyre there at all  at least in nullsec you have local and know how many people are in system with you twenty t3s cant decloak on you from nowhere
nice and interesting ideas but not real solution against cheater script userstoo easy to write a script which is warping between safespots better if a cloak need fuel usage because the pilot must recharge his fuel and script unusable in that situation
op youre not fooling anyone with your alts in their newly made 1 man corps youre basically copypasting the same statements in the exact same bad englishwith that pointed outusing that reasoning we should also nerf traders and manufacturers i mean all they do is move some numbers here and there maybe ship some stuff this way and that way in fact most of their money earning happens when they are not actually logged in much less undocked and shootable by their enemiesthere are an innumberable amount of counters for dealing with hostile cloakies here ill repost them from another thread for easy reading have everyone who wants to rat in the same fleet so you can all warp to each other if problems occur yes effort have one or two people in taranii flying around system as a rapid response team stealth bombers hate small fast highdps ships dont minmax your fits for ratting pvp fit them ie omniresists warp disruptor warrior ii drones heavy energy neutralizer so you can give your interceptor buddies time to get to you yes this will cut into your iskefficiency boo hoo alternatively have someone with you in a plexsanctumanomaly in a supersebod artyfit muninntornadomaelstorm not only can they assist you and help you clear things up faster but they are very menacing to slow tankless stealth bombers falcons rooks and kitsunes can jam hostiles from long range so miners can warp away logistics ships use them for their intended role keeping people who dont want to die alive change up your ratting tactics use range andor speed rather than plain gank and tank stealth bombers cant move all that fast when cloaked if you are really skittish use a cheaper more disposable ship yes that tengu will be able the clear out a plex in under an hour without breaking a sweat but a t2fit cerberus or raven is a fraction of that and takes what a 15 to 20 reduction in iskefficiency maybe a bit more effort too that sounds fair for risking 80 to 90 less of your isk check the killboards of the guys cloaking in your system you can guesstimate their active times by seeing when they get most of their kills if you are afraid of normal cynos get a cyno jammer in your system if you are afraid of covert cynos use the above tactics very few ships can use covert cynos see belowan addendum knowing the strengths and weaknesses of cloaking ships can help you immensely stealth bombers and covertops ships have almost no tank any ship with the proper point defenses can breathe on them and theyll pop recons and t3s all have a targeting delay of about 5 to 7 seconds including the time to actually achieve target lock you have about 7 to 10 seconds to warp off  recons and t3s all suffer from some problem poor tank poor dps or poor speed the only exception to this is the cloaky proteus but a heavy neutralizer or two can easily neuter it t3s cant equip covert cynos black ops ships are exceedingly weak in extended combat due to their poor stats and cannot warp cloaked but thats a side issue if one lands on you then you are screwed as they almost never travel alone to get killed by a blackops ship means that you screwed up badly in some way or just got really unlucky no you should already be in a pvpfit ship with a buddy who can instalock anyone who decloaks nearby and instapop themand the simple fact that you know there is a potential hostile defeats the whole point of covertops dont you thinkthis is a person issue not a game mechanics issue if people are so greedy that they refuse to share isk with someone who can give their ship better odds of survival then they deserve no safety at all or iskseriously all you need is one person in the right ship to help you is it really that hard to dredge up one person out of the hundreds even thousands of others who might be in the same system doing something similar sorry i find that very hard to believesomewhere in your alliance chat is a gullible rookie you can con into watching your back for a paltry amountlook lets cut the crap an afk cloaker is one person in one ship in a system where a resident has many places to run and hide in where said residents corpmates and alliancemates also live in with all their ships and all their equipment which has the capability to deal serious damage to another thousand man alliance and has yet been shut down by one mani dont even think i can begin to articulate how cowardly that sounds a highsec miner seems to have bigger gonads than the people who whine about afk cloakers how is that possible you ask well the miner does his trade in a system where local is filled with an innumerable amount of strangers and any one of them could be a potential ganker
 good postand youd think ribikoka would be able to use one of the ten different alts he uses to back himself up in threads like this to perform one of the roles you suggested wouldnt you
im laughing when i saw those answerscloakers are alone  who dreamed this silly answer   stealth bombers and covertops ships have almost no tank rotflthey easily can use cynocovert cyno generator man they dont need tank enough for them a scrambler dampener and a cyno and you dierapid response team  lol a ratter gonna die between 3060 seconds no one will save them from adept pvpers no one will to save them the time period is too short and impossible to defend all systems how many time you need to move one or two system range ratting with pvp ship is not help for anyone because the rats will shot too and pilot get handicap furthermore he will suffering income deficits too another economic damage suffering from inactive afk cloaker playerand you talking about 00 maybe you are a pro player and you can build cynojammer in low sec your buddy facepalm answer was the biggest ridiculous answer maybe you never heard about timezones when just few players online and players dont have active buddies what they do  log off because some afk cloaker in his system got advance against active players and why use cheaper ships reasons of inactive players  thats not op for an inactive player inactive players why affect playstyle for active players  thats the dumbest thing in this game
everyone is dealing with risks in 00 to make some profit i ninja ratted gangs running around solo pvpers trying to catch juicy ratters for months on war fronts but i dont want to adapt to broken mechanics really sucks as ccp is banning bots that gets u advantages and breaks the game experience for other miners they should tweak the cloaking systems which now get advantages to alliances hot dropers mercenaries they actually get paid to put a net of afk cloakers in attacked regions and break the game experiences of other ppl by simply not being on comp
that is one of the risks of living in nullsec if you cant deal with these risks why should you get the reward go back to hisecwhat is lol about having friends who can respond to a hostile ship or group that cynos in and shoot back it may seem like a foreign concept to a carebear like yourself but fighting off enemies  rather than demanding ccp remove them from the game  is kind of what eve is aboutas for using the pvp shipfitting you state you will not do it because itll damage your bloody isk per hour ratio well then you have zero right to complain  youre aware of what youre doing sacrificing survivability for a slight boost in profit and willingly made that choice you cant make those decisions and then pretend youre a victim and ask ccp to change game mechanics because you flat out refuse to adapt or approach situations differently thats just stupidinactive players cannot effect the playstyle of active players they are inactive they are not doing anything if the active players do not want to risk it and make that choice that is on their heads they have no one to blame but themselves as for timezone coverage well recruit more people if you have insufficient manpower for your endeavors or to defend yourself that is a problem with your corporationalliance not with any game mechanic recruit more players make friends with neighbouring corporationsalliances etc dont scream to ccp to change the mechanicsto summarize stop being a selfentitled coward man up adapt prosper
projecting much ah but they are alone unless there is more than one but that doesnt really change anythingoh dear does it hurt when you narrow your eyes that much youre looking at each piece of advice as if you can only do one at any given time i assure you its more than possible to do many of those tactics at the same timeim a personal fan of the superseboed arty ship helper and pvpfit ratting ships instapopping stuff never gets old neither does surprising some  who thinks you are easy pickings why would people whose job is to keep people safe be out so far away they should be in the system where the threat is or where the most people areuntouchable heart wroteratting with pvp ship is not help for anyone because the rats will shot too and pilot get handicap furthermore he will suffering income deficits too another economic damage suffering from inactive afk cloaker playerboo hoo if you want to farm in a minmaxed pve ship then accept that youre cannon fodder for any proper pvp shipgiving up isk efficiency for proper point defense is working as intended imoand yes not dying to rats in a pvpfit ship requires that you revise how you shoot the rats ie change of tactics if you had actually read my earlier post you would have seen that i mentioned this ex dont tank and gank speed tank and snipe themuntouchable heart wroteand you talking about 00 maybe you are a pro player and you can build cynojammer in low sec heh no one is concerned about afk cloakers in lowsec half of local is a potential threat at any given time even if its nothing but especially if its corpalliancemates in local were used to itand when we run level 5s down there we do everything i mentioned above did i mention that i like supersebo tornados untouchable heart wroteyour buddy facepalm answer was the biggest ridiculous answer maybe you never heard about timezones when just few players online and players dont have active buddieswhy are you in an alliance whose tz is different from yours isnt that boring what do you do when another alliance decides to roll in and take overuntouchable heart wroteand why use cheaper ships reasons of inactive players  thats not op for an inactive player no thats just common sense flying a billion isk shiny with no backup is a killmail waiting to happen afk cloaker or notuntouchable heart wroteinactive players why affect playstyle for active players  thats the dumbest thing in this gameindeed it is why should manufacturers and traders get to affect how much i have to pay for something when they arent even logged in its criminal i saylook as long as local chat gives nullseccers the ability to id a hostile the instant heshe enters system afk cloaking remains as the only viable way to catch 00 ratters and miners and its not even foolproof either as i have been pointing outwhen local changes and stops giving away free instant intel only then will i accept that cloaks need a counter
i think you see the problemsafk cloaking mechanics is broken same when bots gets advantages without play
1ah but they are alone unless there is more than one but that doesnt really change anything shahfluffers wroteman the cloakers most of time not alone 2if you want to farm in a minmaxed pve ship then accept that youre cannon fodder for any proper pvp ship shahfluffers wroteno matter you use pvp ship or not for npcing the threat wont decreasing the enemy just open a cyno and you will die furthermore a lonely ship can kill you because the rats give extra damage on you you will cannon fodder with your pvp ship too better if the pilot use pve ship and wont go out to ratting when enemy in system3heh no one is concerned about afk cloakers in lowsec another stupid answerwhen we talking about broken afk cloaking mechanics we talking about the whole problem and not just reducing to one specific area this is the difference between your stupid or our smart opinionthe problem is complexsuch as your what u tz u use asking useuausasian tz is different many times some player cant play with other one4common senseno is not common sense when i wrote why get advantage an inactive player against active player5why should manufacturers and traders get to affect how much i have to pay for something when they arent even logged inrotfl today that was the dumbest thing what ive saw from youtraders give threat possibility against active players  inactive traders not a possible danger for your activity
i find it strangly amusing all these cloaking ballance threads end up making 00 sec less dangerous than low secmaybe the rewards should be adapted acordinglynone of these ideas will probably be adopted as long as people can dock up in stations in low sec and npc 00i think people that are thinking cloaking needs to be reballanced which i dont by the way should take in mind that their ideas shouldnt make 00 less dangerous than low
i have to agreei feel safer in null sec because it comes with the mentality that its big boy space this causes people who go there to normally have a defined reason why they are therethis means the locals who own it and those who want something from the spacebecause of the low population of nullsec depending where you go people who are there are either blue or red forget the ship they are in you have an idea right off the bat they could be out to get younow take lowsec many more unknowns you have more people most of which can be neutral though some flagged as low security those who have low sec status come in two stripes those who pirate and those who proactively defend themselves when some comes out behind them or they attacked someone red to himcoupled with the higher population lowsec makes it so that guy who could be cloaked could be going after any bodyso no unless you want to make it easier to find targets when you are hunting so they cant run in time making any change to ask cloak screws the whole lurking shark
you talking about wrong thingsthe main problem is the inactive afk player who not at his computer could manipulate the active players gamehave nothing to do with how dangerous low or null sec this is a bad game mechanics if something such the cloack give advantage to active players thats fine but when something give advantage for inactive player against active players thats a fail
so what is your proposal for being afk in a station
thats dangerous for anyone  thats make economic damage for active players 
wrong wrong incorrect and wrong the inactive player cannot manipulate another player in any way whatsoever cowardly crybabies make their own decisions and do things to themselves then try to shift the blame onto others it is extremely dishonest like punching yourself in the eye then running to the police and crying that someone who wasnt even there beat you up
you trolling and insulting others again and again inactive player can manipulate active players gamethe advantage u get is distrupting others game by not being on your computer the residents in the system can never know if the cloaky is afk or not and any even a bit smart guy want go ratting when he knows there is a possible hot dropso when one alliance deployes to attack another the attackers shut every single system with afk ppl that is a pretty big advantage for someone not being on his compby zloco crendravenbalkan express
alright lets get one thing straight an inactive player cannot manipulate anyones game they are inactivethe person manipulating their game is the one who hides from the potentially inactive player it is a self defeating choice but it is still a choice they do not and cannot force you to lose money if they are not at the computer they cant do anythingalso fluffy and gunslinger are not alts of each other their posting history would make that clearjust because more than one person disagrees with you does not make them alts
again you wrong and dont telling truth gunslinger altan inactive player can manipulate active players game the active players dont know he afk or not and wont go out to ratting when the potential danger is too high they wont go out to ratting and theyl lost isk this is why afk cloaker in enemy system get advantage without playing against active playerseveryone know this who say anything else dont telling truth and just evade and just want to save their advantages from a wrong game mechanics
oh for gods sakean afk player is not manipulating the game the player who hides isill admit there is no way to know if the cloaker is afk but if he is he cannot change anything the only change is because people like you make a change you manipulate your gameif a person is doing nothing they cannot be doing something its basic logicand im not guns alt stop using that stupid excuse for why people disagree with you
oh my god i think you knows nothing about how can terrorize peoples with inactive cloaker altsif you dont want a sarcastic answer then dont tell stupid answersthe cloaked terror is known tactics in eve online
this thread appears to be on a slippery slope good discussions benefit everyone personal insults kill those discussions i will leave this thread open for now but if people cannot refrain from personal attacks then i will lock itremember not everyone will have the same opinion as you this does not mean that they are wrong and deserving of derision and insults it is our differences that stop things from getting stagnant so please be respectful of one another and lets try and have a frank exchange of ideas thank you  isd type40bisd type40 lt commander community communication liaisons ccls interstellar services departmentb
calling troll on this one no one is this willfully blockheaded and irrational on the offchance the op really is this way and i hope to whatever deity heshe worships that heshe isnt we can all rest easy knowing that heshe has done nothing to present a case that might potentially cause any change in fact by more or less disregarding all statements and advice that run counter to the op the op has done more to damage hisher own thread than any of us could have ever hoped to do
just gunslinger and his alts trolling or insults others with crying and other words without constructive answershe cant tolerate when peoples disagree with him
ribikoka if a ratter makes assumptions about another players activity or intentions and chooses to do or not do something based on those assumptions that is nothing to do with said player that player is not manipulating anyone as they are literally doing nothing you cannot place blame on someone else because you made assumptions about them and then chose to act on those assumptions further still even if those players were manipulating metagaming employing scaretactics or whatever else you wish to claim which they are not they cannot as they are not active well welcome to eve that is exactly what sets eve apart from other mmos and is key to its success if you dont like that or cant work with those mechanics youre playing the wrong game if you wish to take a break and try other mmos you may send your isk and belongings to me and i will keep them safe until you return
you still not understand the truth and just talking nonsense thingsthe inactive cloaker who can terrorize active players with his scaretactics get advantage against active playerseasy to understand this who want to hear the others answers many players dont aggree with you in this topic no matter how you trying with your alts thats not change the real things the afk cloaker get advance and can terrorize active players and can damage economics without playing that is a bad game mechanics
and hypothetically i can send a mail using eve gate to an industry corp telling them to pay me or be wardecced is it the fault of the mechanics or the industry players themselves if they all jump corp to avoid the mere threat of being wardecced even though i never logged into the game i beg to differ
the other afk topics show to us something wrong with afk cloaking if so many players want to changethis is not surprising and it cannot be a coincidence when the afk cloaking mechanics is broken and unfairand please forget those silly answers from trader and manufacturersthose players not dangerous to any players they are not risk active players game when they inactive and they are not possible threats
the idea i posted of course needs some balancing i thought about the completely invisible timer after warp to help active cloacky scouts they should not suffer too badly from the proposed mechanic that allows to scan the area of a cloackerof course this can be abused by scripts aka bots but that is against the eula and will hopefully get those people banned to propose a valid mechanic i just have to assume that everyone is playing by the rules not botting and you dont need a clocker to be invoulnerable by using such a script it works with every ship that has a reasonable align time warp around per script between a handful of good unaligned safespots and noone will scan you down in time the script could even create new safes in the process if you really want to get down that road if you care about cheaters you will never find a viable solution thats the job of ccphaving a ship with an increased radius where it decloacks ships is the only chance to make the mechanic work as intended even if you know the area where the cloacker is 50km radius for example it is very hard to sweep that space with the current radius you need to get in just think of how many people you need to fly in formation to form a net that can effectively sweep a chunk of space especially if the target is moving and you only have a rough vector for his movementthis could be a role for a frigate or destroyer hull a small fast ship that isnt very useful for other things this can be balanced to make fleet commanders think twice if they want to bring 20 of them for a roam just in case they see someone cloacking the ship has to be made for that purpose then it will be mainly used for search parties in own systems and not everywhere a cheap hull can do this jump in do the sweep kill the afk cloacker get another ship for your next roamthe possibility to scan down the area where a cloacker is hiding is limited you need a ship with scanner probes for that and not every roaming fleet brings probers so for the most part nothing changes but for defending a system probing and sweeping ships can be combined to make the life for a cloacker harder and kill off all the afk cloackers
the idea of a ship that can scan out cloaky ships is abysmal it entirely destroys the roles of cloaking ships and completely trashes wormhole space and ccp will thankfully never implement it they are not that crazystupid
your idea is not bad but better if you dont give to chance for botters no chance to scripting  no cheats and dont need to resolve this problem
ok then scratch the part with the 5 min timer a cloacker that sees probes on dscan simply has to assume that somone will show up in the area so he either has to warp away or just watch what they try to do and avoid the sweepit will still allow cloacky fleets to set a trap but they have to keep in mind that there is a potential counter the area where they set the trap could be exposed by a prober and the allys of that prober could try to decloack the ships
you didnt read my first post did youi am not speaking of a ship that can scan down probers and pinpoint their location i am proposing a general mechanic that lets you probe down the area where a cloacky isits not meant to give you a warpin on top of him you will land like 2050k off him not knowing the exact location just that he is roughly in that area you then have to sweep the whole space to find him and if he is active he will see what you are doing and either move around the sweeping ships or warp away
your idea would need more thought on specifics especially with how eager eve players are for finding loopholes but as a basic it isnt badnot as bad as cap usage or fuel then again neither is cancer for those who do not speak english as a first language that was a joke using hyperboleanywayribi why do you think me fluffy gunslinger pretty much anyone who disagrees with you is an alt of the otherpeople are allowed to have the same opinion as another i dont go around accusing you and everyone else in this thread with poor english who think this is a problem as being altsalso we have been mostly constructive in our responses gunslinger less soalso to the person who suggested i dont know about danger two years in whs low sec and npc null last few months in hs because i havent had much time to play i dont stop when someone i dont know is in the system i keep doing what i was doing with a few extra precautions only a few times have i regretted not docking up and i can say without a doubt that i did not let anyone who was not at their computer affect my incomeafk cloakers only effect your income because you let them its like throwing your money out the window and complaining when folks pick it up off the groundis afk cloaking a dirty tactic yes so is most of them in eveis afk cloaking effective yesdoes the afk cloaker do anything aside from sit in space nope you do it you are giving the afk cloaker what they want or dont want they may not care you are responsible for any loss in income
additional bumpwarp mechanics need a touch up
i have no confidence that this kind of thing would work its too easy to gameannoying as it is if a member of the csm is being a disruptive douche but is staying within the nda  tos  eula then hes probably doing a good job representing a certain constituency
oh i think i love you
i have no confidence in the csm does that count
thank you much we are thukking thrilled at this new development  keep up the good work and thanks for listening
well soon you can be thukking frilled

just to summarize most urgent issues with current plex mechanics it should be not possible to make a system vulnerable more than 100 to capture a plex as offender you should be forced to kill the rats eg by counter stopping counting down when npc are on grid in such a case i would also recommend to make timer the same for all plexes to compensate for the time you need to kill the rats in large plexes this would at least stop people taking large plexes with t1 frigates having no guns there should be more large plexes in general and they should provide more points with regards to contestation  decontestation than small ones
im not sure about that last one i think we already find that most of the actual pvp happens in the smaller plexes  mediums and minors i dont think this is going to change with the changes you list trying going into an offensive plex against the minmatar rats not sure about other sites and killing all the rats i think you will see that you will be best served using a pve ship once your sig radius goes up to the size of a bc or bs those rats do allot of damage there will be very few fits that are even quasi pvp you can use so i say leave it the same where large plexes do not give more toward contesting than smaller plexes you already make more lp per minute in them plus the tags are much more valuable make faction war occupancy pvp instead of pve
from latest patch notescloaked ships will no longer be uncloaked by invisible cosmic signature and cosmic anomaly beaconsi wonder if this applies to mission warpin beacons in the same way devs feel free to clarify please
no thats wrong if you create an easily openable backdoor for cheaters and wait for ccp solution to solve this problemthe fuel usage for cloak more better solution there impossible to cheat
no again no god sake manafk cloakers do anything they terrorize the peoples in system without activity and without play no one knows who activ or not so critical risk for resident peoples to move ratting this terror affect the active players game this is a huge advantage for a non active players against active players and a bad game mechanicsthats why all afk cloaker crying when someone say give afk tag for afk cloakers because they would lose this terror chance ability everyone knows this just who use this tactics trying to stricture this changes
no im against the afk tag because it it unnecessary and provides carebears and bots even more free intel and power they should not have all this handed to them on a silver platter if they are unwilling or unable to put in the time or effort required to prosper in 00lowsecwormholes that is their problem im against other suggestions  such as cloak fuel or cloakdetectingprobes because they are quite frankly terrible ideas and destroy several mechanics  and an entire region of space wormholes as for afk players terrorizing people no you are wrong a player who is not playing the game cannot by definition do anything to anyone nullbears terrorize themselves over this idiocy wormhole dwellers seem to cope and cloakies are much larger threat in wormholes
please stop postingwhy are you so annoying you just write nonsense for your dumb readers when in fact you are just fail and just donUFFFDt know how to playyou are wrong and you are talking like a noob playerafk cloakers can terrorize residents
calm down dear i am at least attempting to have a somewhat constructive discussion and to explain issues that would arise from some of the suggestions for fixing not broken none issue afk cloakers your post however was just a long string of ad hominem it completely lacked any content whatsoeverif youre going to make the claim that players who are literally incapable of doing anything are terrorizing or otherwise influencing other players and why that shouldnt be allowed you may want to provide some evidence or logical arguments as for the carebears in null i suggest they learn that they have more than one course of action upon seeing a singular extra name in local they do not have to respond to that pilot by immediately dockingposing up and logging off  they can do that if they wish but that is only one of many choices they have and they have no right to complain or demand gameplay mechanic changes another user better explained all the other choices available to residents such as continuing to rat anyway or altering your fit to a more pvplike fit to increase your chance of survival or having friends in combat or logistics ships to help etc there are a lot of things residents can do to deal with the single extra pilot in local who may not even be at the computer you have a lot of options so there is no need to fix what isnt broken
every expert knows afk cloaking its a tactics against habitants when he write this is not true and afk cloakers dont do nothing he just write silly thingsforget his inconpetency he is an obvious troll who use afk cloak tactics and he dont want to lose this advantage and posting with his altswe known active and passive terrors such a bomb threat no matter the bomb is existing or not exisingjust a stupid man would go in a marketplace where is a bomb threat cloaker in his solar system its a same thinga dangerous threat because habitants dont knows the cloaker are active or notthats why they can terrorize habitants there thats why this mechanics is wrong because they are not active and they can influence other active playersthats not unfair when a players went to work but his character do nothing active job in system as recon or intel job but they can manipulate other active players game thats unfair and a broken game mechanics
an afk cloaker is not a threat just like a logged off player is not a threat the only way they could be a threat is if they are not afk in which case deal with it as for influencing other players welcome to eve other people exist in the sandbox deal with it or leave
seriously you need to think about what you are sayingan afk tag would be an imense boost to both afk and active cloakersan active cloaker would simply wait until the afk tag appeared on himself then wait for the nullbears to go ratting or mining before pouncingthen the nullbears would complain that an afk tagged person attacked them then the afk tag would be uslessjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
the enemy just open a cyno i thought we were talking about afk cloakersum im loosing track why are you now talking about inactive players you were clearly talking about an active player opening a cynoonce again just like the multitude of posts on this subject the real reason people are proposing all these nerf afk cloaking posts is revealed the solution is always a nerf to all cloakers even active ones but the remove cloakers from local and thus making afk cloaking useless if he cant do anything due to being afk and you dont see him in local then there is no afk cloaking issue is always shot down by the original requesters because they would no longer get the free intel that a person was in the system and this would mean they would have to be more careful and maybe do a little more work when ratting or mining which it appeares they dont want to be bothered withjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
its called psychological warfare frankly if you find a way to remove that from this game eve will failsee what you are asking for is the removal of doubt from the unknown thats a huge advantage because if you knew for sure then your enemy cant back door you cant surprise you cant out flank you or cant intimidate youyou are asking for everyone to play wit their hands showing and frankly if you played poker thats boring
and when you are in alone in a system which is infected by cloaker you really will go to rattingreallyif you say yes you will lie you dont know the cloaker afk or not so you wont go npcing you just dont telling truth when you say inactive players cant manipulate active playerss game with this bad gamemechanicsso they are possible threatsagain just for you maybe you need repeated answer or you cant understand anythingwe known active and passive terrors such a bomb threat no matter the bomb is existing or not exisingjust a stupid man would go in a marketplace where is a bomb threat cloaker in his solar system its a same thingwhy  because no one knows the bombs there or notsame when the players dont know the cloaker active there or not afk or notthats possible threat deal with it or leave
qftif you cant manage to deal with afk cloakers go back to highsec
i have already cleaned this thread once i do not expect to have to do it again some of you are sailing very close to the wind when it comes to personal insults so please note that it is not allowed and if it starts to happen again i will just lock this threadplease stick to the topic at hand leave personal insults in your head and stick to discussing the mechanics that should be a fairly simple task  isd type40bisd type40 lt commander community communication liaisons ccls interstellar services departmentb
i can manage them and you too that was the question gunslinger alt the question was inactive players why can manipulate active players game
please dont call me a liar especially since it isnt just me youre addressing but every single pilot in wormhole space when we occasionally do pve we dont even know who is in local we manage just fine as do many pilots in nullsec there are many ways to deal with afk cloakers hundreds if not thousands of players have worked them out and use them often you can too
they cantunless they somehow hack into your game and make you dock up or whatever you are the one doing it you are the one hiding and losing money you are the one being in terror while they sit there and do nothing you cannot do something while doing nothing it is an impossibilityit is your own paranoia that causes you to dock up not the cloakerand ribi capfuel for cloaks is the worst idea for this ever not only would it be bottable but it would destroy cloaking as a wholeedit also i have ratted with cloakies and hostiles in local low null and possibly wh but not sure if they were there never once got hit and if i had worst loss would have been a t1 bc
so you say you will go to ratting when a cloaker in your system and you are alone there
absolutely never fly what you cant afford to loseif im flying it i expect that i will lose it so i dont care who might blow it upoh you were asking gunslinger
so you say too you will go to ratting when a cloaker in your system and you are alone there because you know the cloaker afk or not pi want your answer for this simple question
this answer is another prime example of a noob teaching pros
i dont even know if theres a cloaky in my system because i live in wormholes there might be zero or one or twenty cloaky t3s i cope with it just fine though as do many many other players as for nullsec its arguably a bit easier you have local to tell you exactly who is in system with you and you have static routes and channels for intel about the regionroutes and the activityto be honest i dont even understand why were discussing afk cloakies  the issue obviously is an active cloaky might as well be discussing the hisec pilot who is logged off 30 jumps away they both pose an equal threat none
yes to the first questionrule 1 of eve dont fly what you cannot afford or are unwilling to losei follow this rule so i dont care if they may or may not be afk i assume they are active and continue with what i was doingliving in a wh for six months you learn not to carebut really i will not let myself impact my gameplay because of what someone else is not doingedit one exception there was one incident where someone who had been hunting me for a while came into the system was in avair i think i hightailed it out of there because i knew he was active and hunting
oh nooooo no this stupidity again
so making money while someone sits afk is stupid but docking up while they are afk is smart
megalol  you are a noob player who everytime unnecessarily risk your ship  maybe you are an oracle and you know the cloaker active or not pppive never heard stupidest answer earlier
no im a semipro player who doesnt fly stupid so i dont have to worry if i might lose my ship or not its not a risk if i expect to lose it just a bonus when i dontand no as ive said i dont know if they are active or not i dont carealso please stop with the non constructive personal attacks based on false premises
no you are a noob player if you go and risk your ship unnecessarily everytime when a cloaker in your system
coming from and npc corp alt or main might be a mainits not a risk i risk nothing i already expect to blow up if it happens no loss if it doesnt yahoo next dayevery time you undock there is a chance you will die a corpmate could come and blow you up spies thieves pirates etcand since this is a game hope no one forgot that bit it is always an unnecessary riskedit also they are never my systems i just visit usually i am the one intrudingedit2 have to run will be back later enjoying the discussion mostly
wait if i have neutral cloaker afk alts i cant realize how big noob you are if you go and risk your ship unnecessarily everytime when a cloaker in your systemubermegalol d
did you really just say that anyone who risks their pixely spaceship is a noob its only a game man id rather play a game with people who are willing to risk losing their imaginary spaceships in the name of fun than with people who will log off at the slightest whiff of danger also being able to reasonably judge a risk and make an informed decision about whether or not it is worth taking is not the act of a noob you may have got it a bit backwards in fact
wait im coming from stevie wonder d
new eden as seen by ribikoka et al if you dont immediately dock up and log off as soon as you see another player even one who isnt even at the computer you must be a mega noob710 lols were had threadlock plz

i do an afk cloaker will typically not stop me from ratting ive dealt with this issue a thousand times 1 if there is an afk cloaker in system i typically rat in a t2 or cheapfit drake or talos fit to pvp if im feeling frisky and dont consider the afk cloaker a legit threat ill use a tier 1 bs 2 i dont warp to zero i make bms in each belt and use those to rat from this also helps with raiders that come into system when im not paying close attention by often providing a few extra seconds to get safe cause i often dual  triple box 3 if im feeling paranoid ill align after i exit warp ill randomize my warp in ranges as well as randomize which belt i travel to next the truth is though this grows tedious and its just easier to fit my ship for a fight and wait for the bastard to decloak so i can gank him first 4 i look up the character on battleclinic or evekill and see what he flies who his associations are and get an idea of what to expect is he going to titan drop me bo drop me attempt to solo me in a t3 or recon or sb or is he going to tackle me long enough for his friends to arrive 5 i make sure i have an mwd and know how to use it this allows me to power away from him or power to him depending on my mood 6 if hes a real threat i rat in the system next door 7 i have a goal if i get hotdropped i want to gank more than i lose meaning if im in an 6080m isk drake or cane i want to take out a recon or 2x stealth bombers before i die sometimes i can sometimes i cant afk cloakers are soooo simple to deal with sure it means you shouldnt be ratting in a carrier unless its bait or factiont2 bs and so your isk  hour ratio suffers but so what i personally dont mind a 30 reduction in pay for the extra excitement that a hotdrop provides finally as long as local is sooooo omniscient i dont see any reason to hinder afk cloaking i want an actual intel system that is more balanced i think carebears deserve to know when a potential threat enters system in a very quick manner but i feel there should be some ambiguity as to whether that new local is a friend or foe until you actually recon them
ok i think thats more than enough you were asked to stay on topic and refrain from personal attacks yet you seem unable to do so that leaves me no choice but to lock this thread as moderation and polite requests seem to have no impactin future post responsibly thank you  isd type40thread locked due to incessant trolling and personal insultsbisd type40 lt commander community communication liaisons ccls interstellar services departmentb
the only thing i disagree with are capital ships in c14 whs i personally enjoy killing some noob who just got his carrier out of the oven sitting on a high sec wormhole in a c1 lolmaybe thats just me
i agree boosts should be on gridminers may not like their orca on grid with them in a wormhole but then again thats the price of getting boosts
this could be difficult since sometimes the grid is not correct and you cant see 35km anything i am having it right now where i only see 70km radius of this icebelt and not the full 300 kilometers
raising some more attention to this im hoping at the very least that these factors will be taken into consideration with the pos replacement discussed in the csm meeting but to be honest i dont think this should wait any longer than it has already and think this is something worth placing into the very next available patch
i think it would be cool to get a dedicated ore gas mining shipedit for statsrole 5 extra gas bay space per level of ore industrial5 more gas yield or range questionablegas bay would hold about 5000 m3
cool yesneeded nobetter things for devs and art folks to spend time on absolutelysupported not at this time
not needed more than a mining frigif they have time to make a useless frig when there are already mining cruisers that take days to get in to they can make a gas ship lolheck they could even put a bonus on a ship thats already made the noctis and preme how ever its spelled look alike why not just recolor it and put the ability to have gas harvesters on it and a gas hold
you know this is not such a bad idea better than that useless mining frigate please i support this idea thumbs up rikuedit i think you mean the primae which is in some way very useless they could make that into that gas miner
the mining cruisers are being replaced with tieracide in a short time there will be no mining ships other than the ore onesas it is current bcs do fine at gas mining and those bcs are not being replaced in such a way that gas mining with them will no longer be viable
pretty neat i support this 1
oki hate minmatar ships really but i just took a look at the stabberis this a jokei mean reallythat ship is now the ship that looks the most like a penis in eve and it is called the stabbercome on lol

why are you scared of a single 30 day old character
i run one of these 1 man war dec corps sometimes i have my gf with me but if you really want to not get killed by one of these corps run in groups use a neutral scout put the person on a watch list run locates on them even if they are offline to see where they are logged off so you know where they are when they log back in aka dont be an idiot

you dont lose your stuff you are free to list the items on the market or contract systems you also have the option to put a spy alt into a corporation with access to that station or even bribe an existing member with the same accessedit last time i was in the situation where i lost access to an outpost i had my medical clone set to that station so i extracted several assets by cloning myself back into the station that i had no docking rights to this was a great laugh trying to shift stuff under the enemies nosesagain when bob got disbanded took only one person to do that and years of work down the drain is this really rightid say its perfectly acceptable in eve if there wasnt the risk of loss there would be little meaning to our efforts
you can firesale you can contract stuff off or courier contract it out you can jump clone back and sell it at your leasure i think there are plenty of optionswait until outpost destruction then see the tears

and now that im finally done with the monolith i can do thisfor those who dont want to go back a few pagesmonolithpelicanbedouinpillari am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
now a thing to keep in mind is these are very rough designs based off of the original freighter hulls and were put together on ms paint so not exactly the best medium to work with but all four of them are finally done so discuss and contact your csm reps to let them know we want thesei am the one who exists in shadow i am the devil your parents warned you about
but they are replacing the frigs that have mining bonuses and cruisers with mining bonuses with a frig that has a mining bonus there is no ship that has a gas role in evewhat your saying is destroyers do fine salvaging we dont need the noctis what kind of logic is that
we didnt need the noc noc we got it because enough people wanted a dedicated salvager too bad it killed salvage valuetheres also no ship that gets a bonus to archaeology and hacking
oh but there is it was a free ship given to us one year the echelon was a free ship with a purloined sansha codebreaker on itwhy not stop making free ships for xmas and make ships that get usededitthere is also a zephyer that cant be targeted by sleepers and a apotheosis and the primae for pi these are ships they made just to hand out for free once a year thats not counting the ships that got recolored like the special edition shuttle i have and the iteron amastris edition and the quafe ultra edition and finally the quafe ultramarine editionthey cant make a dedicated gas mining shipsecond editit killed high sec salvage value my melted nano ribbons are doing just fine at 67million a piece lol
wardeccing a system would be nice basically claiming ownership so that you could do as much piracy as you wanted with no gains within that system or some way to gain sovereignty which means you dont loose standings locking all combat capital ships out of lowsec completely if you wanna move caps around do it in 00 with an army supporting you the way they were intended to be moved
i like a lot of the ideas here only issues i see is the separate black market being a little problematic however the biggest issue in this is the overlord idea it looks good on paper but what will happen is large null sec alliances will move their fleets in to low sec systems near them to take control of them so that way it will ether 1 hinder enemy cap travel 2 adds an extra level of income for the alliance 3 provides a slightly better safety net in the event of fail cascadethe overlord idea would be pulling nullsec alliances to low sec instead of new people from high sec this can ether be good or bad depending on your opinion of player owned null secedit i can already hear the goons broke overlord lowsec system complaints now
hello alli understand why bpcs arent available on the common market and must be contracted however there are a lot of bpcs that are dropped by rats or attained by missions or lp stores that have set material and production efficiencies i see no reason that these blueprints shouldnt be introduced on the market and create competition and a new role in the gameim talking about blueprint copies like the empire faction ships or module bpcs such as the caldari navy ballistic control unit attained from the lp store and tag missions or the pirate faction ships like the gila and even cosmos blueprints like the ones from the missions or lp store theres probably a hundred or so blueprints that could be added injecting a slight boost into cosmos crafters and making the finished items more availablenote that this is not an urgent change and should probably be put on the back burner for an opening but it is something that might improve the game constructive criticism on this idea is welcome but i believe its pretty basic bunyip
currently its extremely difficult to grow a faction warfare corps income without donations from its members mission running corps of old used to do this through standard tax as a lot of the reward was in iskcorps should be able to tax lp too so they can develop an income and grow their assets this would make it easier for the fw corps of today could become the 00 corps of tomorrow

i support the proposal love it
the echelon does not get a bonus to hacking the only thing it can do is be used in some incursion sites not sure which as i dont do them but regular hacking it cannot doalso using the gifts as an example is a very bad idea do you want a gas mining ships that is totally useless even for its stated taskthe zepher is outdone by all scanner ships and cloaked ships wont be attacked by sleepers anywaythe apotheosis is just a shuttlethe primae is useless for anything other than baithanger ornament even a t1 indie does pi related hauling betteritterons no better than the t1 versions and big bulls eye saying gank mesalvageyes you are correct i did forget that for the most part wh salvage has survived the plummet of valuei would much prefer ccp finish all the other things they are working on before adding another ship that will just need to be balanced after a few days im not even fond of the free things a much better holiday gift would be to have crimewatch v3 ship rebalance fw pos null tech finishedfixed pick any of thosebut another ship not needed
thats my point they waste time on these ships that do literally nothingi figured if they would have time to do that why not make a ship that is useful instead of an empty hull that never gets usedi would like to see a boatload of other stuff as well1 corp role redo2 pos overhaul so i would actually want to bring other people in to a wormhole instead of discouraging them by leaving them outside the hole until i fully get to know them otherwise they can take almost anything or have access to nothing3 fw to be fun again but thats up to the players in a sandbox game like this if people lose the will to fight because the other sides better that is a player problem other than the war dec crap that goes onbut if they are wasting time making a ship hull anyway why not make it useful in some way and throw the bpos out therehell make it take minerals from omber so it balances the ore out a little bit because that ore is about worthless to mine as is
i seeyeah if they insist on doing ships a gas miner that was useful rather than a gift that only says gank me would be niceid still rather they focus on finishingfixingif they want to do a holiday gift just make snowballs available again npcs can sell them isk sinc or they can be made from ice stuff whatever
there will be hacking frigates and possibly t2 versions
sleeper sites can be rather heavy on decloak hazards though
i have seen quite a few posts about people wanting wanting to take down offline towers and people wanting to keep them i can see a reason to have offline towers in a wormhole high sec ecthere are my thoughts and some random ideas to be able to have offline towers if you want them and be able to take down ones that are truly abandoned1 offline poss should use up a very small amount of fuel to keep the shields and resistances online a sleep mode if you willa this lets you spike towers at moons to prevent other poss from being set up to help defend your wormholeb the small amount of fuel would be the cost for the defensec prevents most exploits for taking down an offline tower that i can think ofd with no fuel it should drop the shields 50 and have 0 resists just a thought may be a bad ideae sleep mode poss may be able to online quicker another maybe idea2 offline towers with no fuel should be able to be hacked with a hacking mod and have a low percentage rate making it mandatory to have t2 hacking mod and maybe implants for hackinga this would allow you to take down old towers with no fuel in the bay so people can clean out places that have just been left to rot3 pos mods that are connected to the tower with no fuel in the tower could be hacked the same way but make it destroy whatever is inside as if you unanchored the moda this would let you own the mods to take the tower down because you can not unanchor a tower without taking down the mods firstb by destroying the items inside it prevents pos bashers from using this mod to take everything in corp hangers or smas without the risk of blowing up the items

by the way the problem isnt the actual 1 man corp that person doesnt undock the problem is if i get into an incursion fleet and spread around space aids then it is easier for larger corps to sneak theyre space aids in therefore no public incursion fleets will run with anyone at war no exceptions
or  just get them from contracts where the rest of the bpc areproblem is they need stuff thats used elsewhere now so the build prices are out of line

 no lp payout for vulnerable systems no vulnerability over 100 timer runs backwards if you leave the flag in a plex requirement to kill all npcs in a plexhas anyone got any problems with that from any of the militiasany chance of a comment from ccp
quick explanationremoves the incentive to leave enemy controlled systems in a vulnerable state instead of capturing themsystems are defendableoffensive plexes who run away will lose outshould encourage plexes to stay and therefore fightremoves the ability to speedtank plexesoffensive plexes particularly larger ones will need multiple ships and therefore provide the possibility of bigger fights in bigger ships

a gaz harvesting ship should adress some of the specificity of gaz miningslow yield an average ladar sites in nullsec containing 3000 units of gaz takes 3h20 to deplete to a single pilot with perfect skills not counting implants and fleet boost largest clouds contains 9000 units which takes 10 manhout to harvest completelyhigh volume a unit of nullsec gaz is 10 m3 thats 30 000 m3 for an average gas cloud in nullsecsurviving ability be it from gaz clouds explosions spawning npcs or hostile players most ladar sites are in nullsec and wormholes battlecruiser sizedtank is usually required being able to take on small spawns of npcs would be a nice ability as its currently hard to fit weapons with 5 turret slots reserved to harvesters a reduction to the risk of gas cloud explosion like the old skiff had for mercoxit may serve such a purpose but would also put the player in a more dangerous situation as gaz cloud explosions are a fine way to defend yourself against a tackling frigate
i dont see how smaller corps or alliances can survive with no pos shield i know the csm minutes are just thoughts and theory flying around but the thought of no force field around the new poss i think will discourage a lot of the smaller wormhole corps1 docking is nice but these new poss better have good defense otherwise pos camping will be the new name of the game2 mooring is kind of an odd way to store ships and better have a bump prevention otherwise these mooring mods will be useless3 if pos camping know as station camping in high sec and low sec becomes regular i think you will see a lot of frustrated players who just quit wormholes all togethera lot of the lower class wormholes are full of 2 and 3 man poss and if you think wormholes seem empty now wait till more people move out with lack of pos protectioneditthis is what i would like to seethe ability for your personal space home to have the means to be upgraded to the resource consumption of a large tower i know they dont plan on using pg and cpu for the new towers so what ever resource they plan on using i would like to have the ability to buy the same kind of defense for my personal home because i bought it all solo and take care of it solo no one else wants to take care of itthe option to upgrade your ship storage small med large kinda thing the thought of using mooring mods to store ships makes me cringe and want to facepalm the fact it was even thought of the larger the ship storage the more it can hold and the more you will pay when you buy the mod 3 types of ship storage modssmall should let you fit a few 2 bcs 2 cruisers atleast 1 or 2 frigs with maybe the space for 1 haulermed should let you add 2 or 3 battleships 1 or 2 bc 2 cruisers 1 or 2 frigs and a space for a haulerlarge would be for the capital ships carriers dreads orca rorq ect so it would only have the space to hold 1 or 2 capital shipsi agree with two step on knowing how many people are docked and maybe what ship they are in because you can do that now with the way poss are set up when you hit the info button on the pos it should show an information window that has a slot for docked players next to that would have an info button and would show a list of players online only and what ships they are in only because you can do that now with the pos system by warping to the tower and looking to see who is in the bubble if you dont want to show up on the list hop in your cloaky and stay cloaked in a safe spot
pos changes are at least 9 months away and have had absolutely no serious details released yet
i like the idea as long as your ship icon stayed on grid long enough to see where you wentall you would really have to do to make going into and coming out of warp look super sweet would be to remove that instance when the ship stops and make the engine trails much brighter and stay longer with engine trails back going into warp looks way cooler especially from a 3rd person prospective its just that you have to be right on top of the ship to see it and since the trails go away during warp you dont get the trails coming out of warp until your stopping and youve already been on grid for some time by then so making the engine trails more intense when the warp drive is active and making it so they do not disappear in warp would make the effect look much cooler without having to make drastic changes to the graphics and not changing the mechanics at all plus it would let you know when someone hit the warp button because there trails just got bright as all hell also please add the same effect that we see when going through planets to other things like stations also
this is the link i just hope that someone from csm sees it
ee online is supposed to be harsh you ginormous fool ee wouldnt hae the number of people it has today if it wasnt different to all the other cookie cutter mmos can stealing and can flipping penalised in 09  10 go back to wow
i see your problem thereat the same time what have you said to these peopleif you tell them what you are doing andor shed tears for these people in angry rantspleas for them to stop you only prolong your war decsbest thing to do here is to either try to get enough people to run a corpalliance fleet and as well as not talking to the war target at all
the op should stop posting and start shooting the one man corp
most 1 man corps dont undock i helped a friend protect his mining corp from a 2 man war dec and they only logged on once to start the second week and then never logged on againi can see a normal corp not being effected just like my friends corp they didnt even treat it like they were war deced they added them to the watch list and went about their businessbut the op has a point on public incursion fleets not wanting space aids because it will flag anyone who reps that corp that is at war the incursion fc and other players dont know and dont care if the 1 man logs on they just wont accept anyone at war

csmthe 13000 bookmark limit before you cannot add any more of your own has been sporadically discussed but still needs to be addressedprotecting broken databases is fine but making it 50000 shouldnt be too difficulti want to be able to bomb again and cannot without deleting thousands of bookmarks to allow myself to make perchesthank youlachrimosis
in the same vein having only 250 corp locations is getting to be a real thorn in the side out here
i support this
my obi can hold 900km3 just give me the ability to put fitted ships in there and im happy
i think the csm has raised your points in the meeting minutes still speaking out is a good thing ccp has mentioned that wspace dwellers are a major part of their consideration in all of this your needs and your corps needs should be voiced
from what two step has been saying it sounds like removing the forcefield is already something thats been decidedid rather people start raising concerns now than just sitting back and seeing how it turns out ie terrible and then having to spend two years desperately trying to get ccp to un everything
basically the forcefield mechanic causes a lot of nasty code issues and dependencies that shouldnt be there having the pos code tangled up with the physics code does wonders for maintainability no
at this point we need to be talking about what we want to see in pos revisions rather than responding to rumors speculation and passing remarks by devs lets focus on contributing to the revisions so that ccp has a clearer picture of what players want to seelets wait for the devblog that tells us their current direction before we go off fighting battles that are probably pointlessedit seriously all this bluster about pos camping in wspace is rather silly dont you think its not like they said you wont be able to put guns on the pos whos going to tank a properlyfitted pos just on the hopes youll undock
the same people who tank gate guns and station guns people do it in low sec all the timeit depends on how much protection you can put on your personal pos if i can spend the isk to have the protection i have now i would be ok with no pos shield now if they make it to where you have to have 15 or 20 of the little player space homes to have the protection i have now im not going to be happy at allposs with a force field lets you warp away even when there are 20 people sitting outside your pos if you have to undock those 20 people are going to mess you upthere are ways around this insta warps ect but you still have that chance if ccp does something like caldari stations where you dont always come out aligned to your insta warpsecondly i should be able to store my ships in my space home not tethered to a mod where eve gods and everyone can see them the talk about mooring mods replacing smas for ship storage is a no go
summaryhow should tiericide affect industrial shipshere are some ideasidea 1 give three per race defensive fast large cargoidea 2 give two per race defensive large cargoidea 3 leave them tieredidea 4 make a great hauler and minifrieghterside idea 1 navy industrialsside idea 2 role bonusbad idea 1 just make one line of ore haulerssynopsisi was waiting for someone else to bring this up maybe even with a solution but tiericide does leave industrial ships in an odd positionright now this is where we are atcaldari and amarr have 2 amarr used to have oneminmatar have 3gallente have 5five sheesh one for each level and no one else even has four it is the most tiered line of ships in the game even the names of the ships are tiered such as the iteron mark v speaking of which this ship has received controversy since rigs were introduced while paperthin it can haul more than a t2 variant which arent so strong themselves if it was given raw tiericide it would require gallente industrial 1 to fly this will make the critics of the ship rather upsetidea 1obviously this is not what would happen in proper tiericide the movement is about making ships each have value rather than be steppingstones the iteron 5 problem aside it seems to me that three types of haulers are needed type 1 good defensestype 2 good speedtype 3 good cargo holdfor this to happen caldari would need a new hauler and so would amarr minmatar would be fine and gallente would have two removed racial differences would come into play here too amarr and caldari would have better defenses minmatar would have better speed gallente would remain bestinclass for cargo i think the mark  names should go for caldari and gallente btwfor this to work the static bonuses would have to change racial defensive bonuses would be needed for type 1 a think a bigger base speed and the current speed bonus would work for type 2 for type 3 a modest base hold and a larger cargo bonus would be in orderidea 2a variation of this would be to remove type 2  speed and make minmatar a near equal in cargo with better speed the advantage here is that no new ships would be needed the models would already be decided based on t2 versions this means that the iteron 5 would be gone to the cheers of critics and tears of traders side idea 1there is one thing that i can think of to do with one or two of the unused hulls navy issue industrials for the amarr and caldari they get a paint job for the minmatar i vote for letting go of the old wreathe and go for a repainted mammoth for the gallente they get back the iteron 5 but with a new paint job navy ships would have more ehp but not bonuses to help them the traditional speed and cargo are one option for bonuses i would like to see 3 turretmissile hardpoints and a damage bonus for small guns and light missiles personally the max cargo hold would have to be smaller than a retrievers max cargo hold ya ppl would still afk with iti doubt many people would like this idea but it makes good use of the ship models ore ships at least have a flight of light drones to shoot back with navy industrials with light arms make sense to me we do see npc industrials that attack wtb blood raider industrial with small capdrain bonus idea 3just leave them tiered as is i donUFFFDt like this idea but it is the simplest solution to a convoluted problem a small buff to narrow the gap between the best and worst haulers would be nice a buff in hp would also be helpful as dps has risen in the game reducing cpu is also an option as that is a holdover from a system that was never implementedimho the cpu was left because of how weak the ships are this gave the option of ewar and extra shields if ehp is raised in general the cpu would not be needed wtb mordus hauler with shield and ecm bonus side idea 2speaking of that mysterious massive amount of cpu maybe those systems should be revisited i heard that they were a deep space life style module others say they were for strip miners before ore was introduced as a ship line iUFFFDd like to hear from devs what that mysterious utility would have been perhaps give industrials a role bonus heck at this point maybe it could tie into supplying dust with something in other words a special bonus to industrials was originally planned and is not a bad ideathis is a halfformed idea but i think the original intensions of the industrial should be considered and revealedidea 4right now there is a gap between industrials and freighters filling that gap could be the difference in ships the smaller ones would be cheaper much faster more slotsfittings and get a light ehp boost the larger ship would need an agility bonus get a big boost in ehp loose some slots and get a nice cargo hold maybe a small ship hanger or pi holdi think it would be interesting to give the first one a defensive and speed bonus the lack of a cargo bonus would let it be both the strong defense and speed ship a large base cargo hold can replace the bonus the UFFFDminifreighterUFFFD would get a cargo hold and agility bonusbad idea 1another more radical method would be to remove racial haulers the problem is that that would not jive well with t2s and freighters i think we can all agree that it would make a mess if this was years ago i think pure ore industrials would have made sense but not now its a moot issue but an option i wanted to bring up and shoot down
ee free to play and carebears abound oh wait it was just a dream
that does not work as the soe arc is considered both new player and notasnew player stuff
find an incursion fleet  fc that isnt a ridiculous babycoward then or start your ownagain the fact that huge fleetscorporations will shut down their operations entirely or exclude corps because of a one man dec is laughable i laugh at you incursionbears worst bearsits not a broken mechanic its broken stupid players ccp cant fix that
lol your asking too much of carebears to not to be ridiculous babycowards
after clicking loads of times to cash in 7mil lp i thought why not add a quantity box to the lp store
spelling errors aside 1
i run a fair amount of logistics for our corp and alliance currently when moving a lot of items for different people the best method of keeping things straight seems to be creating courier contracts and setting them up to alts then trading them backa simple solution could be a create pallet option for multiple items in station since courier contracts will box everything up nice and neat for you anyway this would save a lot of time and troublethoughts
youd think oned just use containers for thisbut theres no size between 3900m3 inside a gsc and the oh100000m3 that fits in a general freight container although is there a reason you cant simply have people put their hauling requests in as corp or alliance courier contracts in the first place
thats how we run most freight for individuals but there are times when either that system wont work for the occasion or were trying to move many things for the alliance while keeping them separate at the same timealso smaller freight containers could be another useful solution
not entirely sure what the create pallet does that a courier contract doesnt other than not costing 10k isk
saves you the trouble and time of having to use alts just to get little cardboard
i can support something like this with a few limitationscontainers cannot go inside wrappers and wrappers cannot go inside containers or other wrappers if you want volume compression its going to require more workwrappers cannot be jettisonedthe contents of the wrapper should appear on dscan and if a ship is destroyed the wrapper should be destroyed as well so that the loot drop rules are applied to its contents after all were talking about strapping a bunch of items together for logistical ease not putting them into something that would withstand the violent destruction of their transport
eh courier contracts are station to station  where do you need an alt for setting one up
you need one character to set it up and another to accept it its an inconvenience that might be avoidable
its all well and good making booster limited to a single grid but often gangs would like have different kind of gang take the shield gang wanting information links aswell as the siegeskirmish they either shield tank and eos or they have to put them onto another claymore and not get the full affector a bigger problem i believe comes with armour gangs wanting skirmish links armour claymors are not likely and whilst it is possible to armour tank an on field booster loki but only 2 links but if they are looking at changing t3s these will not be affective so again it would be a damntion with skirmish links onnow many will say thats a worth while penalty but it puts armour fleets in worse position not been able to get armour links and skirmish links to full affect whereas as a shield gang can have both siege and skirmish link to full affect
maybe they will have the most desired feature for station if we dockwindows
lmao that would be nice
see i thought the only reason people moved into whs was for the lack of local the pew pew and the lewt from ships and sitesremoving a pos shield from small towers would encourage more of the said pew pew and generate more lewtif you want to be safe head to empire
no one at all has said that would be the issue the issue is when someone decides to bring enough people to knock over a pos theyll bubble the undock and sit everything on it defending fleets having to undock into that would be hell at least with a forcefield they cant completely cover the entire area fleets can properly form inside the forcefield and pop out at an angle that gives them a possibility of doing something
reviving an older thread here but this issue is still relivant i got one of my corp mates corps today and tried to rub it in his face and i couldntplease either fix this tell us you will or wont fix this or tell us why you did it
exactly thiswhy was it donewill it be put backjint hikaru  miner  salvager  explorer  spacebum in the beginning the universe was created this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move
i am ery much in faor or the tag idea that way any aggression against rookies is clearly intentionalto iterate on the other ideas here make another tutorial a 3rd mission from aura that would detail that you can be attacked anywhere anytime warp to location and obsere or een be a ictim of a npc gank ended by concordsurely that would be enough
awwwweeee diddumsguess you will just have to wait it out
oh noez not the spelling naziagreed 1
nice theory another way would be to add label so you can id the clientowner then sort the cargo by label alphabetically job done
by dscan youre referring cargo scan right also consider the ability to put them into general freight containers though i agree that they should be able to be scanned through the container nice
yeah i meant cargo scan i promise thats what i said in my head too many wormholerelated posts my fingers go for dscan no matter what i mean to typeid say no containers at all i feel there should be a choice to make containers for longterm storage or wrappers for shortterm while im all for making inventory easy to manage eve is a game that generally doesnt give players an all of the above solution
it is but the lack of local lets you fight on your own terms if your smartand they are talking about removing the force field for all poss not just small
again id see no issue hereboring shield bash with cap fleet is boring
my only concern right now is the talk of limiting pos sizesfunction in lower class wormholes there should be no reason for this as lower class wormholes require the same functionality as c5c6s while enduring the hardship and danger of wormhole spacesee this thread pos and whs for the entire discussion
i find it amusing that one of the areas of the game that is pretty much working wonderfully suddenly has a slew of ideas or fixes proposed by ccp  the csm that would make it terribleits like they cant just leave it alone they have to do something to wspace regardless of whether something needs or should be done
this poss have very minor issues that shouldnt take reinventing the wheel to correct
oh god what did i just read
you read posts concerning poss in wormhole space we dont expect you to get it
looks like im going to have to invest in a couple of bomb bpos
lol just because something is bad doesnt mean it cant be worse
current situationas a member of fleet it is very difficult to determine what fleet bonuses you receive while we have a green check box to indicate we are receiving some type of bonus this is not adequate fleet bonuses in their current form are buggy and do not always work as they should often the fleet manager must revoke and reassign booster positions to make them work especially in regards to warfare links to actually determine which bonuses we are receiving requires right clicking on a ship or module and comparing its attributes to theoretical eft numbers this is at best cumbersome and typically not practical proposed solutionadd a new tab to the fleet window ui or elsewhere that lists all the fleet bonuses a pilot is currently receiving who is providing them and what their fleet position is examplefleet bonus tab 10 bonus to armor from fleet booster fbcharactername10 bonus to targeting range from fleet booster fbcharactername10 bonus to scan resolution from fleet booster fbcharactername2 bonus to mining yield from fleet booster fbcharactername15 bonus to shields from wing booster wbcharname2812 bonus to shield resistances from wing booster wbcharname2812 reduction to cap use of shield boosters  transporters from wing booster wbcharname2812 reduction to duration of shield boosters  transporters from wing booster from wing booster wbcharname15 bonus to agility from squad booster sbcharname4852 bonus to the range of propulsion disruption modules from squad booster sbcharnamepros1 this really allows people to see what boosts they are getting and allows them to rectify it when they arent getting boosts they desire 2 it might help us to finally debug the fickle fleet booster issues i cant tell you how many times weve had to revoke a booster and then redesignate them as a booster just to get their bonuses to pass correctly 3 this provides the individual pilot a tool to be situationally aware of major changes to their ships performance consnone that i can think of at least from a gameplay stand point related discussions fi provide a fleet bonus information tab  by gizznitt malikitefi view fleet bonuses with ui  by honiahakafi feature request fleet bonus menu info  by richard m227an incomplete and open csm issue raised in may 2010 fleet ui  show warfare links  by corving i was unable to find a corresponding discussion thread
even though i have a page1 post in supporti will point out that before they were removed there was an increasing trend of people creating characters with realworld names such as binladen justin beiber and other celebrities people probably have hate for and repeatedly suiciding them to sell the corpse in jita local for iskif that continued and was something that external gamingnews sources it could mean very very bad press for ccp who usually only has good pressfood for thought
separate factory manager ability to install and delivercancel jobs into two roles install or delivercancel just like the ceo is only allowed to unrent an office but the role rent office doesnt allow unrenting capichein the interests of helping ceos encourage industryminded n00bs get into that career by allowing them to install jobs from the corporate hangars without needing factory manager role ccp needs to prioritize fixing the corporate rolesas it currently stands the role factory manager is needed for many actions specifically cancel job whether it be rd or manufacturing and installing corporate jobsccp needs to alter that so the role to cancel a job is a separate role than install that will fix that problem this game is wonderful because of the element of risk but its also interesting because of the level of effort one needs to put into doing anything  please correct this insanely easy way to grief that scares any sane ceodirector from giving factory manager simply to allow someone to take advantage of those players skills in research and manufacturingwhy is this so important to me to be above many other needed fixes because it shouldnt be childs play to grief yes risk is supposed to be part of eve but to make it mindbogglingly simple for a bully to interfere with another with hardly an effort seems to speak volumes about who designed this game bullies hey im just saying what the carebears are thinking when they unsub
i guess this would be part of the corp management upgrade or something to improve that side of eve problem is no chance of that now for a yearmaybe after crimewatch and dust ccp will work on things which will improve eve for most people
okay here me out its very simple null sec alliances are really big now whats the maximum fleet size what 5 wings of 5 squads of 10 characters equals 250is it some hardcoded thing they cant exceed 256 characters if not for the love of god increase squad size to 15 at least and if its not too much trouble could you please for the love of everything holy allow us to set which squad is the default join oneerrrrrderp nevermind me i guess 256 is hardcoded if you add 1 fc plus 5 wc  256
whenever i think eve cant get any lamer someone posts a thread like this to remind me there is no bottom to the well of lameness especially when it concerns pve raiders like these incursion runners in eve
hi i have recently tried salvaging in game which has been fun but is slow and kind of bland i had out a warrior scout drone which got me thinking while it sat doing nothing while i salvaged there should be salvager drones the same as there are mining dronessalvager drones could be fairly easy to implement there would just need to be another drone skill to learn increased ranks in the skill could increase the drones salvage chance the same as the salvage skill for players there could also be tech 1 and 2 drones like the salvager 1 and 2 modules the tech 2 drones could have better salvage chances and work on more difficult wrecksi think the drones would be quite fair they could be used by any ship with drone capabilities the same as any ship with a high slot can use a salvager module there are often a lot of wrecks to salvage so having a salvage crew of drones would allow players to salvage several ships at a time they would also give the benefit of greater salvaging range like mining drones can reach further than the players mining vesselthe drone salvaging itself should be the same as a salvager module there could be cycles and each cycle has a chance of salvaging the wreck later on some implants could be added to the game which increase their success chances or even an upgrade module could be made that increases chances or speeds up the cyclessome ships are considered salvage ships from what i understand at least i heard one was the noctis anyway some ships could have salvage chance bonuses for modules and drones as wellthats all i can think up on the spot thanks for reading like if you agree
so interesting that youve thought of this brand new idea just months after ccp showed us the artwork for itand mere days after ccp saying that its comingalmost as if youre psychic or something
hey i didnt check or see anything for it so if its coming out thats great also no need to be a prick about it deterring people from posting ideas by being an  doesnt help anyone stay classy

helloim flying scimitars and i have to add people to the watch list in these fleetsbut sometime i have to reload the game and i have to redo the watch list what take sometimecould you not add a feature to safe export the watch list and after relog a load import  thanks
point 2 reminds me of a suggestion i made to corp a few months back fw guys get lp for killing eachother why not let people get lp to pirate factions for kills in low sec would encourage some low sec pvp
yes
i am not sure how i stand on adding a new faction persay but after 5 years and having trained to fly all 4 races sub caps i will say that personally it would give people like myself something to get excited about and something to work towards which isnt another 34 week l5 skill so the point from a devs view would be reengaging with long term loyal players and its gotta be a better thing to spend their time on than breaking sorry unifying inventories and the like  besides i would think designing new ship content might also be a fun thing for the devs as well
you didnt check perhaps use the search function next time and see that this idea has been proposed thousands of times ccp falcon
before you start any new thread on the forums especially here or in features and ideas run a search or bear the brunt of people telling you you should have done research on the subject before spammingbecause youre new here ill be politewelcome to new eden heres your rubiks cube go  yourself
1 approvedand my name is cool
this all strikes me as another epic were too lazy to make it work right situation similar to how drone interfacing was reworked to its current form adding drone bonusesi cant remember the simplifications that went into missiles  fighters much much latter but that iirc at least was not game affecting just a we need an easy win lets make our server engine do less workits time again ccp says to throw another long held feature on the altar of itmakeitfastwell i saymeh lamersi for one adore skirting around shields and its a damned shame the unwillingness to do what is quite literally the most trivial collision detection routine there is distance from a point pythagorean theorum has been top down decided as too hard to bother solving and is being axed safe quarters are important in space and physically being on the edge of those quarters is a grand line to cut close toi hope new  interesting  good can arise from new poss but they sound like theyre being turned into the appendix no safe quarters moon mining is being replaced twistedly after poss are remade with ring mining theyll be the step child thing no one likes when all they do is act like a big cargo container with guns make capital ship constructionists even more nervous than they used it to extend my drone interfacing rant theres some due cause some of the rebalancing in the wake the additional decoupling provided by bandwidth was good but that stemmed from something which was bad which was simplifying the game because running the game was proving to be hard players do not directly care that were making your power bills higher making cpus weep my first experience in eve was sitting for 12 minutes outside of rens watching a thorax with 10 drones circle it just going wow that was epic and cuts were made epicness paired down because the cpus were sobbing themselves to sleep over having 10 drones i feel like pos shields are being sacrificed for the same cause that again its laziness and unwillingness to invest to make possible the chaotic thick busy world that something good is being sacrificed and id rather not see it go dont think the heart is well set on this one
not everyone in eve lacks manners i encourage you to share your ideas my advice is to do a quick google search of the eve online website something like thissiteeveonlinecom key wordsguess what this happens all the time people are always asking for more drones which causes lag to get implants from corpses which loses an isk sink or to get backmore sp which defeats the veteran advantageand really guys hes less than two weeks old he wasnt around when that information was released give him a break
even if your idea was not original at least it was good enough that ccp thought of it too so dont let the rude morons put you off proposing more in the futureat least you made an effort with your proposal some of the ideas here are atrociousjust be sure to do a little research first to see if its been requested before welcome to new eden the biggest gathering of misery and hatred you will ever see
ok my 2 centspos are too badly bugged they need to be fixed or removed no middle ground the gms have been failing badly to assist in a timely manner with nullsec pos issues leading to billion isk losses and people quitting the gameenoughif ccp cant sort out pos then they need to be removed completely and more versatile micro stations added just give the damn station windows so you can see if there are ships outside it
lol lady flute aparently every avenue of the game ccp and gms are causing billions of isk losses and doing nothing to progress the game how bout u stfu and stop trolling every thread in here
this doesnt mean they arent being discussed now
stations currently not destructible pos arepos currently not modular stations arewhy arent they just amalgamating the two structures into 1 why not just a more scalable modular pos that could cost upward of 1200b with all the right modules installed on it but allow small corps to get into a pos for 500m1b with a very small amount of services availableit would allow more selective dynamic pos for small corpswould still allow the right balance for large alliancesccp would only have 1 structure to  with instead of 2 when dealing with development issueswould also be a great isk sink when blown uptie some of the new taxation for alliance corp taxes on everything  as mentioned in the minutes into the pos mechanic  tax on station services for instancecould also be tied into a new sov system later  ie number of modulesmodule upgrades in the system being used by people etcand just plainly  a better lowsecthey could still look different dependant upon what modules are installed etcexampleliving in lowsec running a mining corp with a refinery module a small market module cloning module and some defensive modules could cost you 10b but its ok cause you make it back over time  the 3 refinery modules you installed allow a 3 tax on minerals your market module only allows 1 tax but the offices you just installed are now raking in 30mofficemonthetcseems like a nobrainer  but im not ccp and this could be too big a change
the problem isnt the difficulty of the computations in terms of cpu cycles on the server its a matter of code structure and design the current pos code has its sticky paws in way too many parts of the eve codebase which is part of the reason why it became so decrepit and buginfested and thatll have to change including forcefield removal as the current tangling of pos forcefield handling with the rest of the physics engine leads to well nastiness
in high sec at least why not just have towers continue to consume starbase charters when offline
title says it all i vote no confidence in the current gms due to horrible failures of timeliness in dealing with nullsec bugs and stuck petitions contributing to massive isk losses by players and cancelled subscriptionsthere are commercial gm service provider companies out there who do outstanding jobs in other pvp games in my view eve palyers would be better served by ccp outsourcing the gm services for eve to companies that do a better job of providing timely and appropriate levels of gm serviceslate responses 24 hours for stuck requests repeated circular dialogue with players condescending insulting and evasive answers by gms are all examples of things that are simply not appropriate for a paytoplay pvp game when you refuse to help and worse insult customers who are paying us to play the game your business is never going to thrive i can simply spend my money elsewhere over the years hundreds of thousands of eve players ahve done exactly that for many reasons but incompetent gm services should never be a reason players leavefurther whether ccp retains the current gms for eve or not i would like to see the world of darkness gm services outsourced why because the current ccp gms are badly tainted by apparent favouritism and condoning exploits made by certain corporations in eve while this is not the place to debate the detail of such allegations which ccp denied it would be a wonderful opportunity for ccp to start fresh with external gm service providers who are not tainted by such perceptionswhile others are obviously welcome to disagree with my views and this is a discussion forum so healthy debate should be welcomed by all not flaming please in my view the gm services are now a factor holding back the commerical potential of this game they need to get better or get replaced
a vote of no confidence in this op for seriousmy gm service experience has been absolutely fabulous well it could be better naturally if i could file petitions to get free isk and a few super caps in hisec stations
the petition queue ccps gms use is the same as any other company outsourcing gm jobs just because thing take some time doesnt mean things would improve at all from the current processput your bigboy pants on and learn to be patient
spreadsheets are very useful to industrialists everywhere however alttabing and manually entering data is time consuming and boring not to mention counter intuitave as you already have note pads and calculators in the accessories tab why not also have a basic spreadsheet nothing fancy like macros maybe just a basic spreadsheet with simple formulas been able to copypaste from info panes dump market data into a spreadsheet etc would save time and be immersive to all us spaceship industrialists and accountants
as described in quoted petition
i always assumed it was tied to the windows doubleclick timer as you can adjust it there as that doesnt seem to be the case id suggest to ccp that they do that that way users dont have to make the same adjustment in the os and the application
bump i still support this
keeping this at the top  not that the csm or ccp really cares given the topics  replies in other related  unrelated threadshrolt ceo live free die proud
for the new overhaul ccp could change the mechanism of the refinery giving it job slots instead of the refine button it would be easier to code and make skills relevantalso if ccp wants to make things better for pos use and encourage player to have individual poses or join corporations they can set a fix  of the we take that cant be reduced with standing or rise the actual we take on npc stations these way people would use pos to refinealso take a look at this and say what you think it is about the new pos system i would really appreciate if someone from csm could spend a couple of minutes in it
i think there must be stations outposts and poses for what ccp is planning for the new pos the big diference bwtween pos and outpost is that outpost dont consume fuel and cant be destroyed whille pos are gonna be better and consume fueltake a look at this tread there are some things that you may like
ive seen a few posts like this it seems that this is becoming a problem i would like to know what ccp or he csm think of the issuei myself have seen a few more around lately here and there at least they are destructiblefor highsec just pay for a wardec im so gald npc corps cannot use them
for highsec they should just let anyone shoot poses that have been offline for more than 2 weeks
eve has lot of trials lots of new ppl come and try it eve became a quite popular game in the mmo world the thing is eve doesnt retain so much of those trialspve needs to be re restructured form bottom to top a whole year 2 expansions at least should be dedicated to pvemissions new missions new arcs new cosmos better ai missions for more ppl 3510 new type of missions challenge missions not instanced kill a bs of every pirate faction kill 10 ships in low sec etcexploration more interesting sites different analyzing hacking and salvaging mechanics random generated puzzles tricks meaningful discoveries nex stuff patches u patch your ship which gives u 1 missile velocity etc archeology which would give u achievements in form of certificates wis type exploration after docking into abandoned sitesminning new mining mechanics added to already existing one afk mining should stay because lots of ppl approve it new mechanics would be more interactive and could allow 2 and more ppl to cooperate which would yield more ore moon mining in high sec with bargeswis poker rooms espionage tactics theft tacticsindustry some additional mini games to the already existing production mechanics where if u decide to do them if u are good u can minmax the production outputjust few things i had in mind
1i have played other mmos and after the trial i base my decision to subscribe on if there more to do with eve it seems like the common response is do what you want its a sandbox or  there is no endgame just train for what you need after the fir
better ai making missions current missions any easier or harder is a huge no nocosmos missions should be removed or be made repeatable every 3 months or so like epic arcsyou can run missions in a group now or run incursions if they put level 5s back in highsec it would better thoughmore sites is fine using different skills is also okpatches are called implants they exist certificates are uselessno docking with sites for wis exploration this makes it almost a mandatory featurenew mining mechanics such as anything to make mining interactive means your distracted against ganks so nomoon mining with barges could be ok but i dont see it happeningif you want players to stay they need to get them in a slightly bigger ship sooner the frigate rebalancing will help i think as well as the new destroyer
pve needs tweaks and additions not a trash and redopatches um we have those they are called rigsthe mission ai already a world better but improvement in fluidness would be goodnew missions ya they should have a couple a patch and improve less popular onesmultiman missions yes ccp wants those two i do l4s solo and with friends it is a great way to help young players earn isk it is a great way to help older players build standings it is a bad way for me to earn isk splitting loot is a pain time is not cut in half so iskhr suffers im fine with that for a younger player but i should be able to earn more with an older one l4s were designed to require two people but it has not worked out that waychallenge missions could be interesting more pay out for faster kills or working out of order ever blitz save the damsel a protection mission where payout is based on how many ships you save would be cool i would like to see missions have different challenges in them say they want someone alive the toughest bounty and you have to leave himherit plus save other ships which it targets that would enter logistics and ecm into missions heck a keepalive mission where you are pure logistics would be change and you could go against factions wo penaltymining needs an overhaul afk should not be encouraged active mining should yield better resultsgroup mining has always been better than solo mining imho it is even better with the orca even without the orca and only two ppl you are better off snag the basic leadership skill have someone always mine someone haul pt and you are both ahead
can i vote for no confidence in op
suremost parliaments have a vote of no confidence system i honestly thought this would contribute to the legitimacy of the csm adding another control to itif it doesnt work i guess it doesnt work
i second this motion cpp implement now
says the person from the alliance including players who are usingknown exploits in nullsec safe in the knowledge that the gms will take 24 hours on a sunday to even acknowledge the petition and typically 2 or 3 days later before they actually get around to investigating which of course means the exploit is done and dusted save for screenshots which at best show only corp and alliance tickers  not nearly enough to take enforcement action against those intentionally taking advantage of tardy gm systems and bad programmingsorry goonwarm players have been profiting handsomly from bad gm service and ccp is happy for that to contine that is part of why ccp need to outsource  they have had too long a history of certain alliances doing very well out of certain design flaws and gm service failuresas for every company using the same streaming and processes rubbish alchemic dream were running gm services for adventurine sa in the pvp game title darkfall they used que streaming like anyone else but where active exploits were reported they promptly had an invisible gm appear and look to gather timely and impartial evidence of what was going on eve are currently running a gm service with repsonse timings and gm comments that are directly comparable to blizzards wow gm responses which is simply not good enough for a pvp game that includes looting from other players remember this is a pay to play game there are no excuses for ccp not to deliver timely and courteous gm services 247 if they cannot do that then they invite rampant exploiting botting and other forms of cheating guess what they have not been able to attend to stuck ques inside 24 hours and whole alliances have started exploiting when ccp isnt looking not ours we simply walked away from the bullshit that was going on in nullsec addendum i left darkfall some time ago to see what eve was like now in anticipation of dusts launch so my comments related to darkfall were from when i did play i do not know who is providing gm services now in that game or their qualitytimeliness but i am saying there are gm service companies out there who really do get it about pvp free for all loot games and have provided gm services that are better than what i have encountered in eve in the past months pvp games live and die by the quality of thier gm services which if too thinly stretched quickly lose control and exploits become rampant gms giving tacit approval for people to exploit in nullsec is simply not acceptable to me  nor should it be to other players or to ccp
funny one of our former alliance was mocking the gms in teamspeak about the bugged roqual the gm moved from their wormhole so it could be repackaged and returned  the gm forgot to put it back guess where the roqual was left if you want super caps in highsec you just need to learn to work over the incompetent  overworked gms better apparently
i was talking to someone last night who said that hed petitioned an inspace corp change hed engaged a wartarget in space and several people on grid immediately joined the corp and opened fire on him the gm response was that that is acceptablei personally have a warning for doing the exact same thing a day after the dec scraping ban was lifted you know when the gms said anything goes and then said anything but thatgm consistency in rule enforcement seems to be getting worse im not looking to be rid of them i just want the gms to be more attentive
ive actually had all of the petitions i have ever raised dealt with inside of 48 hrs no one has ever belittled me or given me circular communicationi cant be an anomaly can ii have heard people raise similar concerns about other gm experiences i guess i just have never had one personally myselfalso when ever a gm processes your ticket your given a chance to review there performance enough bad reviews and im betting they wont be a gm for very long
so what are goons exploiting now in the next goons are cheating thread gms have always been helpful and quick with all my problems did i always get what i wanted not but it was handled very quickly i had 2 of my accounts hacked on the same day i lost a fair bit of isk from it but they were able to do the best they could and the reasons they gave about why they couldnt just give my stuff back after it was sold on the market made senseif your just going to whine about the gms are bad cause they dont exactly what you tell them then maybe this game isnt for you
not only do i support the idea but i was trying to think of features i would want it to havei would want to be able to share and even export themthere should be corp and alliance sheets public sharing should be an option tooan api or evegate version would be amazingdrag and drop with smart fill in would be so handy drop a blueprint and it fills in what it needs1
i think its a bit strange that we dont have them already given that eve is usually called spreadsheets online
i was reading the latest minutes particularly the part about kill contracts when the lightbulb hit merevamp the contracts by having ccp create a number of standardized agreements that players could select and drag into a blank contract this would allow an advanced option to create unique contracts above and beyond what is current offered in the us we call this boilerplate standard terms usually legal that are used with certain items filled in the blanks think of those legal kits you can buy at office stores or the company legal zoom for example standard choices might include the following1 pick up  and deliver to station 2 acquire  and deliver to station 3 kill   times4 receive payment of  for completed contract5 receive  for each primary objective6 receive  for each secondary objectivethere might be 100 or more such basic such terms and could be dragged into a blank contract and filled in the empty spaces to look like thisexample contractprimary objectiveskill player boom boom longtime 1 timesecondary objectivesacquire player boom boom longtimes dog tags x1 and deliver to station jita 44 candari navyreceive 6 billion isk for each primary objectivereceive 1 billion isk for each secondary objectivecontract will be considered completed if all primary objectives are completedsuch a system would address many of the player suggestions for various sorts of contracts and ccp could add and remove contract terms as needed this type of system would dramatically open the doors of new types of agreements and provide an easy framework for ccp to update the contracts system in the future with very minimal additional coding it also allows more types of agreements without completely screwing up peoples existing mechanisms you also still allow scammers to be very creative while still allowing everyone else to formalize many agreements within an eve systemsuch a system on contracts could be used forplayer bounty contractsexpanded courier choices such as 1 contract to pickup from multiple stations with a single destinationpos defensemercenary servicesloansinvestment contractsplayer defense like protect a miner from being killed for 24 hours to receive x isk etcand so much morethe issues raises regarding bluered status for the defense contracts could be addressed by allowing contracted players to attack aggressors who fire at a player or celestial object that is in the contractplease discuss
it has my support
didnt they say there will be miniature force fields around modular componentsyour ship will be moored and be rendered invulnerable allowing you to see whats going on i dont see what the big issue isas long as you properly fit and defend your pos then you should have no issues ccp is more likely gonna make pos weaponry stronger in the revamp
thing is about mining thas is vital for the economy and so for eve itself a lot of ppl like afk mining not a lot of hustle smaller yield rate but still enough if the afk mining is shut the economy would be a mess everything would be so damn expensive ccp needs to tweak it a bit more so that the active mining is lot more proficient than afk like dobule more at leastabout patches someone said we got implants u said that we got rigs what i ment was a 3rd layer rigs u get from industry implants from missions lp and these patches u d get only from exploring it wouldnt give so much edge as the previous 2 mentioned above u put it on the ship and it boost some atributes i d made it small boosts but huge variety of patches about certificate achievements and someone said is useless well it wldnt give any kind of boosts or nerfs it will add content for ppl that will go out explore find artifacts on which some history will be explained and u get the certificate that u found it than u can sell that artifact collectionars will show upeven now i just get some skills up so i get certain certificates that i find important
very good idea totally support it

 change the icon and name so you know when its a scram or a disruptor
agreed 1i needs to know what ones it is
you mean jovethey was supposed to be the 5th race but ccp changed plans and now people cant use them and they are cut from the stargate net new pos system new sov system
not sure about adding a new race but i would like to see a huge epic arc mission involving the joviansalthough my current flavour of the month would be to maybe use some of tony gonzalezs work including the new eden system where it all began and terran artifacts as was alluded to in his books empyrean age  templar onejust my 2 cents
how would goons exploiting the market or tech be considered bad gm customer service i believe they should be fixing stuff like game crashing errors or bugs not halting enterprising individuals using intended game mechanics
everyones experience will vary and it is pleasing that some have experienced good gm servicesjust so you know its no accident several of former alliance were banned for selling the plex they bought off ccp sure ccp realised how completely dumb that was and reinstated thier accounts and gave them each a 24 hour credit on the respective accounts game time but they were still banned out of the game at a critical time in our nullsec activity48 hours response is fine  if you are playing wow in nullsec in a full loot pvp game initial response to exploitingstuck should be 20 minutes not 48 hours when ccp cant help in a timely manner things go from bad to worse fast in nullsec and the losses that flow from bugsexploits can often compound either ccp needs to act in a far more timely manner or they need to give the gms the policies and tools to fix the inevitable messi know precisely how to always win in pvp in nullsec do what a couple of the superrich alliances do and simply clear away the evidence inside 24 hours will i share the details no of course not nor will i actually bother doing that  cheating to win is profitable but not actually either fun or a worthy challenge but there are those who can and will keep indulging in certain activities that are possible due to bad coding and gm response times that are simply too slow for a free for all full loot pvp game sephiroth we ahve also had complaints appearing about obvious market price bots that have been tracked by some players for months and repeatedly reported to the gms the lack of action from ccp has called into question whether ccp has the technical competence or the will to actually do anything about those bots which are doing serious damage to the eve ingame economy i expressly make no comment on goons links to market or tech as i have no evidence of any mischief by them in relation to either  what i am talking about is something entirely different the bots i have had drawn to my attention are unsurprisingly from npc corporation toons  after all you would have to be quite stupid to be running market manipulation bots on your main accountthere are ways to detect bots both ingame and using client side software with permission given in the eula ccp has been actively working on botting but to date the market manipulation bots seem to have been in the too hard basket for ccp as would be a gate activation bot for nullsec area defence early warning full loot pvp games always bring out the most inventive in the player base  but the flip side of that is ccp need the best gms they can possibly get to counter that inventiveness as things stand they seem to be losing given positive reports of gm services as well as negative perhaps what they need is an outsourced company to assist their current team with updating their policies and improving their timeliness maybe an auto reporting of the location of the player with preferential attention giving to wormholes and nullsec for exploit or stuck ques remember this is the csm forum its not just kick the company or flame the posters  we should discuss what is good and not so good and offer sensible suggestions on how to improve gm services for the good of all eve players
well yeain this year ive experienced that the standard first response time was 2 to 4 weeks thats ridiclous now they are doing somewhat better sometimes answering within a weekalso most of the gms just try to shake us off avoiding any actual work and thats something i pretty much dislike this is clearly something that should be improved ive only met a single gamemaster who actually did his job and he even believed me and kept on investigating when his tools gave different results he himself took logs escalated to the devs whatever it got fix happened oncealso a lot of gms doesnt even seem to know that bugs dont just mean technical bug when the code is failing they even refuse the idea of things like design bugs inconsistencies and such things they are treating nontechnical bugs as feature request which is clearly something unacceptable in my point of viewi could definitely use here an improvement agree on the topic
i am an elite combat pilot for the caldari state protectorate stationed in the duripant system i will continue to wage guerillastyle war on the morale of the federation nay by striking fear into the hearts of their newest pilots there are more of us than you might think and our efforts are bankrolled by the protectorate we think nothing of dropping 10 mil on a t2 fit destroyer simply to neutralize a week old pilot undocking in their first naitas before the sentry guns engage gallente pilots be adised i will warp into a belt cloaked in my manticore and watch you mine for an hour or longer in your little frigate just to destroy the first hauler you saed up for and the ore while im at it youll neer een know i was there until a few seconds before my torpedoes hit and theres absolutely no profit in it for mewe dont fight for reward or glory we fight to rid new eden of the rotten gallente culturepass whateer rules you like we wont stop until no more elators undockhighsec is owned by players now systems 0510 are new order territory all miners and other residents of highsec must obey the code mining without a permit is dangerous and harmful to the ee community see wwwminerbumpingcom
i found that it makes no sense that you cant hit ships behind the forcefield yet when you fire at the tower the missiles and turrets shoot through the shields to the tower there is also the issue that you can only pos bash using long range or larger weaponry the forcefield is supposed to be the target not the tower projecting the forcefield a large tower has a forcefield 2630km in radius making impossible for many weapon systems and ships to hit if youre right next to the forcefield the distance should reflect thatmaking the forcefield the target rather than the tower will ensure that all ships and weapon systems can damage the shields instead of being 27km when sitting right next to the forcefield you will be within 0 allowing you to hit with any weapon systemonce the forcefield loses its hitpoints assuming no reinforcement after 25 the forcefield should disappear and expose a tower without shields it makes no sense that the forcefield remains in place after the tower has no shields left also when a tower is offline it should have no shields online wherever i go i usually find offline and anchored towers which nobody bothers to destroy due to the large shield hitpoints on the tower who wants to go bother bashing multimillion hitpoint structures for a long duration of time with nothing to gain
read the last csm minutes forcefield will be removed from the game and all the pos system will be reworked in about 8 monthstake a look
this really needs to be done people constantly complaining for years that industrialists are risk averse and wont go to 00unfortunately 25 flat out nerf on their main ingame activity might also have something to do with it 
great minds i was just bringing this up in the industry forum the other day if they want destructible stations more than 1 station per system modular pos pos planted anywhere  why not just have 1 structure instead of the 2 get rid of stations and tie all the station services into the pos  awesome idea  because i had the same one it would allow people to run a pos as a profession also rent offices try and build systems to accomodate office renters fill a market for pirates who live there or simply a refinery pos for your own usereally glad i wasnt the only one to come up with this idea i was about to can it 
i would like to point out at this time that you guys arent put into the csm to bring up ideas that have the most support necessarilymany times ideas come up that the universally ignorant peanut gallery will not understand dont get and dont appreciateyou guys are voted in on your experience as such i think with some of these things you should be making the most informed decisions available to you in the csm as a whole  no matter what some small percentage of forum trolls might saythis is a good idea it would open up gameplay that to date has been closed to people who dont hold sov and even then sometimes alliances only allow stations to be run by the holding corp it is a tiny percentage of peopleif you are going to redo pos then dont do a half assed job of it think a little more deeply that just what they look likecosmetic changes and changes that are popular are nice and all but not necessarily the best or most relevant changes that the game could use
without being able to look at the code i cannot say exactly how hard the refining by person would be but if you just tied it to the current station refining algorithm and just set the rep to 10 or 5 depending on the persons standing to the pos owner and this would automatically tie in the persons skills like the current refine does if the output is to be delayed just route it to a sub procedureanyway i like the idea of player owned stations of modular design but instead of stuffing around and worrying about wether players will make huge space dongs why not just make a system where you can choose a slot on 1 of the 6 faces of the existing structure this would also allow multiple stations to tie in the power and cpu available while increasing the costspersonally i dont care about pretty i want working hell if it looks like a borg cube at least it would be a borg cube that workssame goes for defense i would like to loose say cpu to add extra armor to the pos and be able to fit gun modules within the pos this is actually harder as they would need to be part of the structure while able to be targeted individually or for an easier fix just let them sit off the pos like station guns do atmalso i think the size you can build should be truly modular having no baring on whether you are a person corp or alliance you should be able to build as big as you want to pay foredit as to the mean time frankly not fussed
you had me at hellothis is the same as many of the people who use pos for industryits that age old issue of graphics vs gameplay eve tries to say it has great gameplay but still were sitting in the dark ages of early eve gameplay when it comes to many of these systemschanging the graphics a bit and perhaps no shields or whatever the hell  and not changing the gameplay surrounding these structures is kind of looking at a deep subject but only dealing with it in a shallow wayif ccp are going to make the time to redo these structures god only knows when the next iteration of pos will be  10 more years  can we get some reasonable indepth gameplay changes before then  corp level mineral taxation would require it for onethis is exactly why we need a full analysis by ccpcsm on the various corporation managements for the various kinds of corps they all need the proper tools instead of that we debate pos shields and graphical changesin reply we get the whole well if this entirely logical argument can get some support we might consider itthis is a necessity so that smaller organisations can hold their ground against larger opponents in a defensive manner it will create diversity in operations and enable small corps to grow easily
the problem with mooring is the fact that when you undock you have to make it there first just wait until you undock to a 15 to 20 man bomber fleet on your door step
thisregardless of whether or not you have defenses the pos bubble allows you some freedom in manuevering around there are both advantages and disadvantages for the defenders  attackersseeing whats going on is an entirely different matter than being able to react to itultimately until ccp tells us that they are doing a b and c with the pos system we will pretty much be in the darkwhile i generally have a positive outlook on things and im not trying to be critical but if the recent history of updates  changes is any indication ccp will make a mess of this the scale of which weve never seen beforehrolt ceo live free die proud
i would just like to see a pile of new missions nothing spectacular just another lot i normally only do missions for about 1 week out of a year and even then they are still boring the year later just doing the same missions over and over and over again
mining should work the same way pi does in that the more active and involved you are the better the outcome allows for a bit of an easyafkwhatever income from it but is much more worth it if you play the game more
pretty much does now if you want money mine ore if you want afk income get a mack and mine ice
i just saw the price of ice drop massively the reason is because of the changes in barges heck i sold my idle hulk and picked up a skiff to play around with regular mineral prices went up because the drone alloys were removed they were removed to make mining more profitable heck when mission alloy drop rates were tweaked before nocxium prices jumped through the roof it leveled out it needed to be done prices were too low to make mining viable i stopped mining because even exhumers were too weak and so did many others the risk vs reward wasnt there now people are mining again so expect the prices to drop they probably will dip a smidge again once the ore frigate comes outmining needs to be made more active the mechanic is as old as eve ok years ago scanners got a nice update and ore ships came with exodus it needs to be revamped passive mining should still work but the changes should lower the yield
vote of no confidence systems within government usually consist of the elected chambers voting so in this case it would have to be a mechanism where only csm members can vonc other csm members even then there are strict rules like 66 of members voting in favour of the vonc the problem with player vonc is that they never work well let me use a personal example as the followingi was elected general secretary of my students union i was the only candidate wiling to do all the paperwork involved with such a boring job and there were two options on the ballot me and ron reopen nominationsi was elected with 96 votes in my favour 12 against the campus is something like 4000 studentsthen at a union meeting one of the political groups decided it wanted to remove me and pulled a fast vonc out the bag you need 66 to vote in favour of removing me i was removed with 43 votes to 1996 voted for me yet 43 removed me similar things can happen with player voncs honestly how long does a csm last 1 year it would be a waste of everyones time say a month to announce the vonc and vote it get it over with then 2 months to run another nomination unless they were vonc in the first 6 months theyd only get a 3 month term
confirming you cant even sell corpses trough contracts as when you make a contract the names disapear funny that you need to use 3rd parties to safly sell corpses lol
hello fellow space pilotslooking at the type of fule used by the jump drive on a rorqual oxygen isotopes i cannot but wonder if this does not offer a certain race in the game an unfair advantagecouldnt it be possible to change the rorq so that it uses all the isotope types to jump eg the ship has a built in reactor that can take either oxygen isotopesor heliumetcan then apply the characters skills to determine how many isotopes are used for a jump ofcoursei think this would make the rorqual more accessible for all areas of the eve universecant wait to hear our thoughts
ore ships are when it comes to the race gallente ships therefore they have the characteristics of gal ships mag sensors oxytopes etc so this is working as intended
thisthat said some orestyle ship classes would be interesting there are plenty of factions to build on that idea t1 khanid ships and bpos anyone
yes pleasebut for real i dont want i new raceit would be pointless and waste much rather see the creation of t3 battleships redoing poss fixing faction warfare fixings moon mining fixing blaster boats  i have come to think that its not the weapon system but the ships or the half a thousand other thing in eve that need to be looked at
yes we could play panda bearsoh wait a crap game is using this to make an even crappier expansion and charging money for it
i will try to use reason1 creation of a new race would be a timeconsuming useless venture requiring hundreds of thousands of man hours to design develop balance and create art assets that last one especially for an entire new race 2 it would be such a sink of time and return only a slightly valuable return people would simply ignore the new race and heres why skill training in eve is time based and so this new race of pilots would be completely useless for 6 months until they can get into t2 ships of their racial tier people in eve wouldnt even bother making characters of that race theyd just add the skills into their existing character and train them since you can only train one character at a time people arent going to generate an alt in this race unless they start a new character from scratch and they probably wont choose this new race3 there is no room in eve for a 5th player race the jove doesnt count theyre almost extinct the lore simply doesnt support thiswhat is more reasonable and something i would support would be adding more pirate factions that you can run missions for and aquire blueprints for the 5 current pirate factions are great but you cant have too much of a great thing i suppose d but i agree with the majority of people in here who would rather see poss and so forth
i like all the gms i met
what does the fact that you pay in us dollars instead of canadian dollars or euros have to do with anything
i am unsure if this thread is real or a buffet for the many trolls in eve i would have to say that my experience with gm has been both good and bad can the service be better yes it can i would much rather have the current gm putting out more of a effort in trying to help people the only complaint that i really have with the gm is that they have alts in major null alliances i feel that if people work for c c p or are a gm this they should be aloud into player alliance out of the sake of fairness though i say that i remember one c c p dev saying that war was not fair then changed how the wardecs worked when it didnt benefit a certain major alliance
never had a bad gm or dev response seen some stupid stuff by isds but that is about itoh i had a dev send me a snide comment but given what i asked it was well deservedas to gms and devs playing personally i dont think they should go into player corps it just adds to the possibility that they may favor their corp even on a subconscious level
disclaimer never had to petition a gm as far as i rememberwhile the op sounds like they arent raising any specific issues and certainly have no evidence to warrant the removal of all the gms i believe some sort of process for recourse is probably necessaryif you disagree with a gm decision or have received poor service from a gm is there a process in place for filing complaints about gms do ccp make a point of investigating all these complaints and removing anyone not up to the taskif the answer to all these is yes then all is well as someone who has worked in customer service you cannot get everything perfect or even plain right 100 of the time and frankly the im paying my hard earned us which btw im not im paying gbUFFFD is a ridiculous one and it never washed with me my attitude was always that regardless whether you spent UFFFD1 or UFFFD300 with my company you deserved good service and in this case the players who use isk to buy plex deserve good service tooas long as there is recourse to make complaints if you think the service is poor that is just what youd get off any company
let me get this straightyou honestly believe gms should respond to your tickets in 20 mins out of a game of at least 400000 peoplewhat ever your smoking i want someclearly its potent it realy doesnt matter what you do or where you live in this game we all pay the same subscription fees and gms get to us when they canstop being infantile about this
ill bump this up one last time maybe someone gives a comment otherwise well it gets forgotten
this is getting likes but what it really needs is more ideas and fedabck it needs to be where ccp can see it

i only recently started inventing t2 items and ive run into problems with being able to sell the bp copies i invented because of the 44 issuebasically it would seem that large a penalty makes the ships i would produce lose money with the very best decryptors i would still have ships that cant build for even an unresearched originali dont begrudge bpo owners their better profit those darned things are expensive what i do think is a problem is that having no original places one at such a disadvantage its almost not worth inventingcurrently using meta items increases the chance of invention and not by much at that i would propose the benefit of using a meta 1 item modify the penalty from 44 by however much the meta level is this would mean a maximum of me10pe10 before decryptors which would still be rather low for a researched level and how often would xtypes be thrown away anyway it would only disadvantage a bpo holder if they didnt bother researching like the ought to havethere is still a problem though ships dont have a meta level that i can see in game for this i would recommend assigning all ships a meta level of 2 and allow them to be used to invent 22 bpcs which could be further affected by decryptors the ships wouldnt be able to get more than a few positive me but they would be worth buildinglike i said im a noob at this so its possible im still thinking this through badly but it seemed like a way to make inventors lives easier without screwing bpo ownersdons flame retardant suit
invention needs to make t2 bpos obsolete the current system was designed to preserve the investment of t2 bpo owners it has done so now half a decade later that priority needs to be a faded outcurrent decryptor drop rates need to increase increased supply will lower valuenew and better decryptors need to be added viable competition with t2 bposcurrent efficiency needs to be raised either tweak base me or decryptor effectsall decryptors should create at least 2 run bpcs more runs need reasonable mei see no reason why invention with a nice decryptor shouldnt make t2 bpcs higher than most t2 bpos have then you could leave t2 bpos in the game forever in fact t2 bpos would be pseudo taken out of the game temporarily as they would need to be researched to keep up with inventioninvention becomes a more efficient t2 production methodt2 pbos take a back seat but owners get to keep themitUFFFDs a winwin
what was here is not here anymore p
captains quarters is completely useless and adds nothing to the game it has no purpose doesnt add any gameplay and wont allow any additional interactions so what is the pointremove cq stop wasting time on  that doesnt affect the game and get back to eve as its meant to be played  in a ship not as some dbag walking around station jerking off
you are right as it currently is cq does not add functionality its only a different representation of the menuyou are wrong if you underestimate the potential of the cq and walking in stations in general it can add a lot of flair present lore and other information allow social interaction like corp or allicance meetings so it has great potential for all that not only look at the numbers on the killboardthe proposal here allows to get a lot of content with relatively low workload for ccp as the main part of the content will be created by players you could do the same thing with just window based communication but with cq and probably some station environments to house the npcs it is much coolerand if such things are added to the cq it becomes more than just a redundant different representation of the menu
they need to replace anyones t2 bpo with me and 50pe of t2 bpc i would say enough to keep 1 in production for 2 yearsthis would crash the respective markets but at the same time remove t2bpos and anyone who spent isk on it should be able to make it back
ok lets all be honest herewe all know that once ccp is done fixing and balancing and overhauling everything that needs it were talking like 5 years down the road here ccp is going to go back to jesusfeaturesthis will include reopening of the eve gate and allowing us to move into and conquer the space surrounding earth at this time terrans will be added their ships would be new and cool and different and since all the other races ships would be balanced it would be a great time to add another race of course there was a cataclysmic war on their side of the wormhole that saw the corporations nuked back into the stone age they happened to advance at the same rate that the people in new eden advanced in and all their ships are balancedfurthermore since they used to be much more advanced there would clearly be many archeological and pve activities aroundthis all goes without saying that there would be lots of great opportunities to flesh out some kickass lore heresure i can get behind adding a whole new race
actually devs and gms should play a game as intricate as eve or they will be hopelessly lost when they go to ask a question that does not mean they should ever favour their team indeed in some pvp games gms have an entire corporation made only of employees you can try to kill them all you want in those games and they start as newbies to really understandand as to response times yes in a free for all pvp game exploits  stuck assistace requests from nullsec need to be addressed promptly if they cannot respond promptly due to staffing levels then they need the ability to make good on the losses that flow from their inactivitycurrently if you know that no gm will apprear for 2448 hours and a player screencapture of actions is not acceptable as evidence of inapporpriate action then they have green lighted rampant exploiting that isnt okother pvp games do better than 20 minutes for exploit reports no excuses ccp oh and by paying i mean paying with money not exploiting to earn plex and playing for free the players who spend real money are the ones who pay the bills at ccp  there are ways to get plex for free and free plex do not pay the rent
actually remember that many people play this game wihtout paying any subscription some of those dont do a lot of work to pay for the isk  they cheat most of the 400000 players out there dont cheat but when the gms are so slow to follow up those caught cheating by players so that the cheats get away with it that hurts everyone you me and ccp
you dont understand how plex worksexcept for rare occasions plex must be bought by someone it doesnt just appearso even if you play via plex someone paid your account cost with real money so ccp has already been paid in fact plex gives them more money since it costs a little more than a sub does
ccp gets their money no matter how you pay for a subscription so cheaters do not hurt ccp in a direct manner
no but it is here
this is true but as its apparently a fix without a problem theres no point really
salvager drones came up during my time in the csm and im against them personally the reasons are as follows1 salvagers take up a high slot on a ship drones are often a second thought or augmenting the core damage such as using lights for quick ships most ships would be able to fit a flight of lights and salvage drones without breaking a sweat unless salvage drones were considered heavy drones in which case ships like the dominix ishtar and gila would become even more powerful2 salvagers take up a good amount of cpu drones dont use any core attributes of a ship cpupg thus theyre essentially free to include even if you dont use them3 salvagers have a range of 5km drones have a much longer range starting at 25km admittedly you can use salvagers with a tractor beam to extend their range to 20km but that takes up another highslot and more cpu4 salvage drones can fly in flights of 5 meaning that even with a low chance of success its still much better than a shipbased salvager5 salvagers require capacitor to operate and a fair amount of it too it may not seem like much but for passive shield tanks and other tight capacitor fits salvage drones become a much larger assetgiven these inherent problems i dont see how salvage drones would be balanced in the game unless you made a salvager something that takes like a mid slot and no cpu or pg or some other effectively weak placement even then there would be little to no reason to place a salvager on your ship
if you have no shields on the pos thats fine as long as they beef up the defenses of the pos  guns missiles etcwhy the  do unmanned pos fire each gun randomly for instance the pos defense shouldnt be some crazystupid system like this pos guns should pick a few random targets to lock up pick one to fire at and all guns fire at that targetthis would increase the ability to survive for small corps defending against larger opponents fights could be going on between smaller and larger entities for longer in an areasmall entity moves into nearby system and sets up a posthe larger entity has trouble taking the pos down giving the smaller entity more time for operations in the areapew pew ensueslater the smaller entity creating a thorn in the preverbial side of the larger entity  the larger entity decides its now worth it to call an op to get rid of these guysat present its more likesmall entity moves into a systemlarge entity sees themlarge entity calls 2 carriers and 5 battleships and removes small entitythe end
i guess this isnt a major gamebreaking issue but i think it would be interesting so what the hell right now everyone uses dsts for one of two main thingsin hisec they offer a hardertogank platform for midsized cargoin lowsec and nullsec you bait with them dont tell me its not bait it always issee the issue is that no matter how many warp core stabs you cram onto these things they still align like a pig have no covert cloak and easily get tackled by the most common tackler in nullsec  dictor bubbles in short theyre not at all suitable for deep space so what do we doreplace the 2 warp core bonus with an immunity to warp bubbles just like t3s can haveit may sound overpowered at first but think about it most of these ships still align slower than a battleship and certainly cant get much of a decent speed with an mwd unlike t3s they cant fit covops cloaks so theres plenty of time to tackle them on a gate with warp disruptors and if someone wants to try and bypass those limitations with speed mods and warp core stabs the cargo space they get isnt really any better than a blockade runner nice and balancedplus you know someone will jump one full of everything they own into your gatecamp at some point and youll have scrams right
wouldnt help a thingto make the deep space transport capable of traveling to low or 00 it would need a configuration that give it less cargo space than a blockade runnertheyll need to up that warpcore bonus so it cant be canceled out by one module id say 6 maybe even a web resistance or immunity with it then you can use the fitting slots for speed allign time and cargo
yeah dsts are too slow to avoid the regular points that usually accompany the bubble so pretty much the only time this is useful is for getting past a solo dictor without a warp disruptor fittedbubble immunity on top of the 2 core strength would be useful but maybe too useful as it would make them essentially invulnerable to solo dictors except for wild and wacky multiscram fittings
a dst can skip past that sole dictor camp with 2 wcs without sacrificing too much cargo space that would give it and the blockade runner opposing niches the br can skip past most regular tacklers but is vulnerable to dictors while the dst can pass lone dictors  drag bubbles but is vulnerable to more than one regular tackleranother approach could be a role bonus that improves wcs for dsts in some way without having it built in things such asthey use zero cpu when fitted act as a tiny cargo expander get a  bonus to strength so that fitting 2 wcs has the same effect as 3
i actually am strongly against removing t2 bpos from the gamewhile i dont care about those who won them those who paid for them i do even now those bpos are changing hands it should not be a case of hotpotato where you just are the unlucky one who bought them as they became worthless i do not own a t2 bpo and while i feel they are op currently if we could gradually make me50 or me100 bpcs from invention then t2 bpos could be left in new eden the game would finally favor the new method of productionas for making isk back for those who bought a t2 bpo at their peak they did this under the calculationestimationassumption that the profits on t2 shipsitems would be far higher the hulk used to sell for a billion isk each they went down to less than 100 million after the market crash current prices are not based on profit but materials if you predicted a roi of 2 years back then you got set back to 8 years or more the profits of these bpos are nowhere near what they used to be this also does not factor in any loss in value of the t2 bpo asseti think that we should be the ones with highme multirun t2 bpcsi want better inventionoh and while we are at it make decryptors multiuse good for maybe 510 runs this has a similar effect to putting more in the system yet it also makes them more valuable it also makes production easier on industrialists i just thought of that
first you already mentioned that much of the t2 bpo system was setup 5 years ago to preserve the value of t2 bpos do you really think that most active t2 bpos are still in the hands of players that won those lottery i dont think so it is far far more typical that active t2 bpos are in the hands of investors that bought their bpos using the isk they earned through years hard work stripping players of their assets after they worked hard to achieve them seems like a horrible idea and not at all necessary to elaborate imagine if you spent several years of accruing isk and bought a titan and then ccp decided titans have had their time in the spot light and nerfed their functionality to that of overpriced dread or maybe they just removed the titans from the game and gave all titan owners 20 dreads as compensation how would you react would you be ok with it i would be pissed now the titan example is actually a poor comparison because titans are player built meaning they can proliferate and become so prevalent that the benefits of having a titan are available to all players on the other hand t2 bpos have a static ingame quantity that does nothing but decrease additionally they are not gamebreakingly overpowered even if they are profitable second what t2 production are you exploring sure a t2 bpo has an advantage over a t2 bpc inventor which ill elaborate below but so what if you are producing items which are ubiquitously used like a warp disruptor ii or a 150mm autocannon the t2 bpo producer creates only a small small percentage of the actual ingame production in other words the t2 bpo holder is not your competition in truth unless were talking about rare and lowuse t2 items the majority of production is done using invented bpcs the reason many beginner industrialists have a hard time competing is because many many producers secure inexpensive materials to build their items be it cheap sources of moongoo cheap sources of minerals andor cheap sources of pi ive heard many smalltime manufacturers claim the minerals they mine are free and that is your true  problematic competition not some scapegoat bpo holder third not all invention is equal ill admit i havent spent much time deeply exploring ship production mostly ive dabbled in af  inties but i invent a lot of ammo and modules these are my observations inventing a bpc a significant portion of all t2 manufacturing costs comes from creating the t2 bpc statistically speaking the baseline cost to create a maxrun bpc has an expected cost of 13m isk and should be valued at twice that to cover your probability swings for a standard 10 run t2 bpc most modules and ammo that means just gettng the bpc costs 100600k isk per run this cost is often minimized or belittled when groups acquire cheap datacores hell many people consider their datacores free which they shouldnt its the cheapsupplied inventors that make your stiffest competition for module production the difference between producing a t2 module with mepe at 4 vs a perfect me levels is usually around a 25 difference on a 1 million isk item this would be a 2050k isk difference which is not a significant amount for module production the cost of inventing your bpc is the majority of your markup when competing against a bpo holder 100600k isk  item  note t2 modules very in use and you really need to look at the market value and the movement of an item to see if producing it is worth your time in march 2012 the percentage of modules produce from invention 9395 of t2 gyrostabilizers 8977 of 1400mm ii 8734 of 425mm rail ii 8200 of tachyon ii 7423 of torpedo launcher ii for ship  ammo invention the difference between producing t2 shipsammo with an mepe at 4 vs a perfect me is quite significant the production costs off an invented bpc often run 150250 of the perfect run bpo for t2 ammo which has a long production time and is used ubiquitously t2 bpos are very profitable but only produce a small market share the majority of your t2 ammo production competition comes from inventors not bpo holders t2 ships on the other hand run the full gambit if youre producing an eagle or a sin ships which have the market viscosity of molasses then you really need to research the profitability in manufacturing them or youre a idiot a t2 bpo holder can produce the major market share of these ships and much cheaper than an inventor but so what you dont produce these items for profit because their movement is too little to be a good investment these are items that are usually produced for direct use meaning you already have a buyer on the line before you invent the bpc and you only bother producing it when you can beat the market rate for higher rate items like a vagabond or a jaguar then the market share of bpo holders is low enough that you are again primarily competing against other inventors in march 2012 the percentage of modules produce from invention 9023 of hulks 6785 of sabres 6501 of wolves 2216 of pilgrims 600 of eagles production data sourcetldr unless you are building slow moving ships and items t2 bpos have very little influence on an items market value the me level of your invented bpc has very little influence on the production cost of modules but significant influence in ship and ammo production any new mechanic to alter me levels will only truly help ship and ammo production finally i believe risk vs reward should be maintained any new mechanic that increases me levels should require manufacturing in lownullsec not highsec
ok kso gallente have the best mining bonus giver out thereany other unique cap ships for the rest of the racesor is ccp trying to tell us that if we wanna mine properly we should be born gallente
role players would love some fresh content but no one cares about them seriously tho while there is no need for more race it would not be the first time they were added i just would like to see them look drastically different from the current ones in fact i would want them to look like races that dont existas for more ship lineups i think the last addition of races should be a model for the next just make them a part of the other races for the amarr but my vote is for the ealur that said the ammatars would be a more mainstream choice start them off with amarr ships and minmatar guns p on a more serious note i would like to see the seven minmatar tribes playable such as the thukker tribeit should be noted that ccp originally intended for more playable races this was curbed because of problems with the system that existed at that time with the homogenization of the races it does not add to the game play of eve as it once would havei wish that initial skills were a little different with the bloodlines they should be designed for mains or alts a new character with some science and industrial skills would be nice maybe start a gallente character out with the upcoming ore skills for minersbtw the jovian race did exist but not to players ccp john proctor is an example of one since the incarna expansion they have not been updated and are in essence removed from the game so that means jovians would have to be readded and opened to players here is a picture of a jovian agent which were open to the public by mistake at one point
bump this thread needs more love
i would like to see the addition of alliance bookmarks added also it is a huge pain the in the rear in wormhole space anyone else think this is a good idea 
im new to eve so im really close to all these issues and possibilities been trying to get friends play also but there are many who dont find sandbox so appealing i however know bunch of people who would be completely enthusiastic to try achieve something many games have implemented achievementtrophy system and others track nice amount of statistics to compare with friends something along these could draw people to continue playing after trial and see some progress in their charactersure there are certificates but they are only skill based and doesnt need any active effort really trophies for acquiring or simply flying certain ships visiting certain places and so on would be what some people need
yeah exactly what i had in mind
get out of my eve now i was going to reply to several things you said then i read this mmos should never be designed to reward people for simply leaving it running and checking in every 1015 minutes
eve avarage playerbase age is around 28 it means that most of the players have a work and family so dont got much time to play most of eve is based in in highsec and most of em are miners u dont need to be smart to understand that if u remove afk mining new eden d become chaotic less players and veeeeerrryyy expensive ships and moduleseven players that pvp have few miner alts i am one of them my only way to play this game is to afk mine while i am on my roams having fun and with these new cargos which allow cycles of 45mins the game became so much much better for me loooots of players think the same i am not earning insane amounts of isk its just enough for a plex and some extra for my pvp ships and still i am paying 1 acc with cashbut i am of the mind that active mining should yield more ore than it does now practicing some different mining mechanics and also afk miners are lot easier to gank if there is no afk miners there is no gankers tooso i dont see anything bad with it
several comments 1 i really dont think we need any more mechanics to increase afk mining a mackinaw can already mine for a very long time between redocks has a decent tank and needs very little interaction to mine especially ice mining if you want something more absolutely no 2 moongoo mining in highsec perhaps low end moongoo sure if you are thinking of mining highend r32 or r64 moongoo then hell no this is a game of risk vs reward to get high reward you need to risk mining in highsec is already profitable710mhr for a very casual miner and with the recent barge changes its become very low riskas for the rest of your idea tougher ai more puzzle type stuff less predictability in missions group missions and the like have been proposed before but why would any of this help retain new players elaborate this claim or admit its just some catch phrase youre attaching to the thread to get it read also what makes you think people come to eve to try out pve most of the people i know stick with eve because they enjoy the ingame competition be it ship pew pew market warfare space domination etc i think the quicker you get people blow up ships the quicker youll retain players
as first i never mentioned about more mechanics to enhance afk mining i said afk mining should be left as its now and add some new mechanics for active mining which will yield lots more isk than the afk versionyeah absolutely in high sec should be low end moons but still it will be a nice change for minerswhy pve should retain new players because every single new player comes from wow swotro gw rift where pve are main features they just dont know how to pass from tutorial to the sandbox theme as eve is after the tutorials they start doin missions exploration mining which as activities suck a lot if those activities were a bit more interesting ppl would stick eve after the trial endsyeah most of eve players stick to this game because of the ingame competition yeah some 400k of us but huge numbers millions dont because the pve said they are used too just sucks and lets be fair those pve activities would rejuvenate even the bitter vets
but why spend an entire year focusing on pvewhen there should not be any pve in evei just dont get it spend a year developing pvefor a pvp gamelol
ahm u pvp because of ppl doin pve  ships mining modules moongoo pi mining rigs missions salvaging ammo mining t3 sleepers farming implants missions drugs gas farming90 of ppl are financing pvp and accounts with pvelots of ppl like to play more solo than in groups pve allows thatatm pve is not exciting thats why new players are not into it only hardcore players stay and do the masohistic pve side of the gameand after allmore pve  more ppl around the space  more targets
eve cannot exist with out pve be it mining missions exploration plexing or rattingthere is a symbiotic relationship between the two pvp destroys ships and modules which is what makes pve valuable modules come from industry or loot ships come from industry plus oreloot refining pvp is good fun and a vital part of eve but it creates nothing in itself you can argue salvaging but that is mining ship wrecksthe next expansion seems to be industry focused which is part of the pve side of eve ccp invented exploration to give pve players something more to do the same for incarna eve is more than just pvp and pve including mining and missions per csm minutes needs a buff
i use them in 00 all the time the catch is that you cant use them safely solo which is a good thing
even something as simple as a new rig type geared toward gas cycle times would be a huge benefit and more inline with the specialization rigs for ice and mercoxit
if you change how weapons are packed in pos it would almost sove this problemif instad of putting individual guns you put a defensive station  structure where you fit manny guns and ecm and etc it would focus it fire on a single targetlets say if your pos have 50 defensive modules it could spread its effectiveness between 50 targetsbut if you have 5 battlestations around the pos each one with about 8 guns and extra ecm  then 5 targets would have a much harder time new pos system new sov system

getting really tired of seeing this pathetic logic when everyone rags on the background scenery were floating on a tiny pebble in the ass end of our galaxy yes space appears black for us that is only due to the simple fact that we are in the middle of nowhere in celestial termsif we were closer to the galactic core or nebulae clusters our scenery would be very different and brighter
if you have qualms about t2 bpos i suggest you go over to marketplace and look at the prices for many of these items their cost is based on projected profits from said bpo usually over the timescale of 3 years 
for me the issue came up when i started inventing ships many of which would cost more to produce than the sale price on marketowning a bpo would seem to be the least risky way for someone to produce copies to use in production and bpc contracts i dont really want to affect their reward but on a purely rvr the bpo owners have it easiest even when you consideer the initial investment as they hold their value or are actually good investments for resale latermods may not be as bad but the successes are costly when you add the failures and then tack on an additional 40 waste mechanic it makes invention sucki dont want to see the bpos disappear just make it so the inventors can compete if i had a non decrypted gyro ii bpc with an me0pe0 made with a meta4 mod i doubt the bpo owners would even notice as any mod bpo they own is likely to be at least me50 it would still cost more for me to produce it just wouldnt suck quite as badsince there are no meta ships to use in invention id suggest using uu chips for their invention make them use the appropriate chip and attach a 44 to its use to provide an me0 itemewhat i mean is that with exceptions you almost cant actually lose money on a bpo youre likely to sell it for more than you paid and if you used it to build during the interim youre getting pure profit
1 i understand youre desire to be competitive and with ships and ammo increasing the me is exactly what you need to do i actually think the best method to alter this is to dramatically change decryptors to work on a percentage level rather than have them give a static me increase the resultant me level would be a small percentage of the me level of the bpc used to invent it for example use a gyro 1 bpc with an me level of 50 and a 10 decryptor then the invented gyro ii bpc will have an me of 5 now for balance purposes the decryptors should only give a smaaalllll  increase like 15 10 is extreme as long as the bpcs are different and unique and remain moderately rare in supply the market will still balance itself out and make t2 bpo holders the highinvestment but most profitable with this method i doubt the module production market will change much as the cost of decryptors will easily be more than the savings earned by a higher me level however with ammo and definitely with ships these will blatantly level the playing field at the production end but maintain the bpos advantage of not having any invention costs which will be significant finally given the long me research time on ships it will still require significant time before producers can take advantage of this2 at this stage in the game bpos are an investment item and they are very much subject to market swings the hulk used to cost twice as much as it does now the eos used to be a popular ship to fly the af buff has dramatically increased the number of afs flown eafs might become the new hot item people buy and sell t2 bpos based on multiyear market speculation of what is used and will continue to be used but thats a lot of guess work as ccp nerfs and buffs and changes things dramatically every 612 months 3 the biggest drawback with this is it doesnt incentivize lowsecnullsec over highsec
the rorq has exactly zero racial skill perrequisiteswhat is your issue just buy the fuel the ship needs
ore ships are based on gallente design principles the rorq is not a gallente ship theres a differenceyes because training gallente frigate 2 takes so very long if you start out as another raceseriously its less than 12 hours of training to get what another race starts with why do people think race matters in this game after day 1

bumping to get more peoples attention and feedback
in terms of isk and lp payout frigate only areas should pay out much better they should also be harder to take you can spend years of training just frigates the skill tree goes deep and there are lots of ships but even when your frigate costs you 50 million isk there is no where to risk it to gain 10 million isk you can only gaint 200000 isk while the large and medium size points will always be worth more isk i feel like lp payout and control points should be the same for small sites and large sites just because something is small and can only be hit by small ships doesnt means its not super important to the war effort this is a scifi 1st make it so small medium and large sites pay out the same lp and control points over the system now create a new factor site importance there are as follows 10 min timer green 15 min timer yellow 20min timer green payout is now discounted from what ships are allowed into the site and are instead based on how hard the site is and how long it takes to capture the size of the ship only effects the isk payout not the lp or control points and the importance level of the site acts as a isk payout multiplier the whole thing uses the incursion system for spiting rewards to make blobbing in fw pvp unproductive bringing more than 10 frigates to a site starts to cut everyones payout in half you wont see gangs of 30 frigates running sites creating an environment for small gang warfare same with large sites no one will bring 90 ships into a site when doing so would lower each players payout to 100isk love the system ccp created for that its jst in the wrong place hanging out in a pve expansion when it should be applied to a pvp part of the game so yeah please hopefully you guys can ses the benefit of what im asking for here many players have trained into frigates for years in a frigate only mission that is just as hard to clear as a batleship site the rewards should be the same in terms of the lp reward for putting yourself in a possible pvp situation the isk payout would be lower because your risking like isk
ive reread this four times and im still confused i think you need to clearly say what you are suggestingand by the way there are a few things i would recommend ideas ive heard  read about 1 sites should be optimized for more than one player think along the lines that the lp payout per player is constant up to some number of players like 5ish and then the rewards decrease with each additional player example only 1 player completes a site gains 5k lpif 3 players complete the site the all gain 5k lpif the optimized number of players 5 in this example complete the site they all gain 5k lp each if the site is optimaized for 5 players but 10 players complete the site they all get 55k lp  10 players  2500 lp per player granted the numbers need tweaking but i dont think that fw sites should penalize the profit per player when bringing a small gang 2 the primary reason the payouts are different for small medium and large sites is because they also take longer to accomplish the payout per minute is a little better in larger sites but not a lot and considering the enemy has that much more time to intervene and mess up your plans the payout totals are actually fairly well balanced when compared to each other
the problem with lp payouts especially for frigatesized plexes are that they are almost always farmed by gunless speedtanked frigates since they are speedtanked there is no real chance that the npcs will stop them and by running without any weapons its no surprise that they immediately warp off the moment another player jumps in no risk and in the case of the minmatar at the moment but it could be any faction that continuously stays at t5 at least four times the reward that just isnt very eve its more of an isk printer than a warfare mechanicalso there is no point to defending a system its a waste of time granted the idea i assume was that without defensive benefits there would be a more dynamic battlespace but in reality well look at how the amarr have fared over the summer even in spite of multiple nullsec alliances joining in to helpakaifrogblast the vent core when the wrkncacnter came pthia was killed and yrro in anger flung the wrkncacnter into the sun the sun burned them but they swam on its surface
yeah ill go through and outline what im trying to say i do this a lot lol you should get triple lp for kills made in defensive plex how about thatplus frigate only sites that pay out less isk but just as many lp and control points as any site
not to mention various forms of light and air pollution that obscures any light that does reach usop if you havent done so ever in your life head into the wilderness the next time a next new moon rolls around and by wilderness im talking deep in the ass end of no where the nearest city or factory should be 100 miles away when night comes look up you wont need any other kind of light for the rest of the night

whs are not well in the current incarnation but that has to do with predictability a wh stabilizer by itself is a bad idea but a wh stabilizer coupled with more interesting wh mechanics is potentially a good idea to elaborate  right now all quality wh dwellers know how much mass it requires to close a wh they know all the tricks and techniques to quickly safely and almost risklessly close a wh they use these mechanics to make their whs extremely safe when they want to run start running sites and they use this mechanic to open up new whs so they can farm the systems next door to be honest i think the mechanics to close a wh is very flawed because its far too exact whs need to be far far less manageable so players actually gamble on whether theyll lose a ship on the wrong side if you make the whs much more risky to close people will start to leave them destabilized to compensate add a wh stabilizer that insures a moderate force can traverse the wh without it collapsing the stabilizer can then act as a beach head that needs defending because if it gets destroyed that force probably wont all be able to return i realize there is a downside to making whs far harder to safely close essentially it hurts the ability of wh dwellers who farm out their systems plexes and need to be able to create new whs to other systems to run imo rather than continuously collapse your static wh until you find a system you like there should be a mechanic to open new whs while leaving the old whs alone the price of farming multiple whs is you must deal with more routes for potential hostiles to find you
they seem to be working perfectly fine actually we all seem to enjoy them actually a stabilizer is just a bad idea you want to take one of the only parts of the eve that limits blobs and remove that limiter doesnt really make sense there people already leave holes critical it happens all the time moderate forces already can go through wormholes it seems you dont know how mass works and that 3billion is a rather large number and can fit a large amount of ships im getting the feeling you dont even fly in wspace because your views are so skewed no you just want wormholes to be like kspace gtfo
even though i puke at the sound of wh stabilizer you seems to totally missunderstood what the guy tried to say maybe reread it pread and support dont mess with our whs what is your stance on wh stuff
a blob is a moderately ambiguous buzzword that pretty much refers to any group of ships that outnumber andor outclass your group of ships a wh stabilizer obviously needs limits and shouldnt allow an infinite number of ships through and thats not what im suggesting quit screaming the sky is falling he just wants a tool to bring in 500 man gangs and supers to crush my pos and actually read what i write i want to make whs more unpredictable as it is its extremely easy to manage your wh entrances and exits this is wrong and thats what i want changed you need a new system to farm close your static and wait for the new wh to spawn dont like that there are potential hostiles through a wh close the wh by sending x amount of mass through it there is very little risk and very little downsides to the above my point is that if wh mechanics change so you use stabilizers to control ship movement through a wh rather than static gameable mass attributes you could solve the idiotically lowrisk close wh open wh close wh open wh nonsense that prevails in wh life in this sense wh stabilizers which are really just the new player operated mass mechanic that can be interfered with by third parties would be interesting and potentially good then again if you were a riskadverse pveer that cant handle more risk in your wh i understand why youd be vehemently opposed to this
it isnt low risk to close a hole nearly every orca we kill is on a wormhole and i like killing orcas on wormholes as do other people im sureyou can say whatever you would like but the point stands that you want to have players manipulate wormhole timers and mass using a module known as a wormhole stabilizer which would then be the only method for using an actual wormhole and overly complicates the regular use and eliminates many opportunities to kill capitals and other hole closing ships in wspace
yes occasionally nice ships get caught trying to close a wh that doesnt make it unsafe it could easily be just moronic pilots whatever words youre trying to attribute to me this is how i feel the ability to control your entrance and exits allows a wh dweller to make their system far more safe than i think they should be in my opinion if you can dictate your entrances and exits you have way to much control imagine living in kspace where you could tell the stargate to randomly aim at a different system anytime you want you just need to pass the right mass of ships through it that level of control is bad for the game even if whs dont have local cynos or stations if changing wh mechanics involves some type of wh stabilizer im more than willing to listen and evaluate it it might make wh travel overly complicated or it might make an interesting and new tactical tool im not vetoing the idea until i can review it within the appropriate framework also im not saying wh stabilizers are the only way to solve the ease with which whs are closed perhaps the mass equation needs to be balanced with diminishing returns such that if you send a specific ship through a wh it counts for full mass the first time 10 mass the second time 1 mass the third time and so on then you might catch multiple orcas instead of just one
the problem with everything posted in this thread is that is just makes no sense to me you see i am a simple kind of man i love to shoot people sleepers gas clouds and posses posses is barely on that list because it only produces tearsanything that will make it harder for me to produce the tears of others makes me die a little bit on the inside do you feel me dying do you feel it well stop itas i said earlier whs only need 1 thing more noobs for me to shoot the spawn rate on sleeper sites is good the frequency on ladar sites is good the unpredictability of finding wild holes is great it gives us a sense of adventure we cant just go about willy nilly like putting our big ships through new holes you never know whats inside there but you sir want to change that you want to make it safe to move large amounts of ships through a wormhole at one time  that and  your plan with a capital  you will completely kill all of us when you allow the goons or hbc into our holes by simply erecting a module on our holes trust me i know how themitanni likes to erect thingsyou simply have no clue how whs or the wh community works you have never lived in anything that required brain power to use and you have no clue of the amount of death that awaits you if you ever step foot inside one of our holes all you simply know is that whs are hard i want to make them easier sit in your drake farm your c2 sleepers and leave us higher end folks alone you will be better for the experience
please actually read my posts before commenting on them i think you very much misunderstand my desires

i kind of like lonetrek the most tbh
again not empty quotingwhat we do need tho is more capital ships from other races that use their fuel and make our lives more sexy
