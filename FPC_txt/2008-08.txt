every sniper worth its salt has a sensor booster stop saying that a single damp is going to reduce its range to 46km when it will absolutely not in addition damps are stacking penalized so more damps on a single target is less effective when people ask for an rsd boost they want rsds to be nearly just as useful in a recon gang as a falcon is jamming 34 targets at a time
this issue will be discussed on the next csm meeting with ccpyou can and should still support this if you think its right though
agreed x 10
i would love to see dual monitor support not only for a single fullscreen client but multiple clients in fullscreen mode
supportedwould also be nice to be able to changeset the eve cachesetting folder path so you can put in on your drive with the best performance instead of your default os driveuseretc

the silence is deafening on that isnt it
this should just be the beginning of pos changes but in a lot of ways most players can barely enjoy themselves just playing the game as part of a 00 alliance i am ashamed whenever im reminded of the amount of people spending hours every day doing sadistic levels of logistics just so that the rest of us can almost have fun some of the time
and offline  unanchoring one is just as bad if not worse
agreed that starbases need a bit of a chnge to there logistics
supported as a long time pos logistics person i can only plead to the dark ccp gods for mercy
if only there was a pos fitting screen if only
i hate to agree with goons but making setting up poses tedious isnt doing anything to hinder pos spam if you are a 00 entity and you want to hold or take space you do everything in your power to place as many towers as you can in the shortest amount of time possible no matter how tedious or unfun it is you have to if you want to survivei agree with the bob dude and probably everyone here that pos warfare is completely broken but leaving it as tedious as it is is pretty bonebeaded there is another thread about all pos modules being interconnected i suggest everyone go check that out
all rsi jokes aside great idea
give it the fuel bayi think theyll still another boost of some sort beyond that to make them viable
heck just making the pilot not show up in local would boost this ship
as many people pointed out the fuel bay and range wont fix the issue these ships need a complete overhaulcovops cloak recon bonuses and the ability to actually fit them in a meaningful way  more pgcpubetter resists maybe tooas they stand now they dont justify the costs

i think i will vote with my accounts against the nerf
i remember some pretty big changes in very early stages of eve which is to be expected as everything was new and felt like beta testing a productbut since eve has matured i cant think of any patch that had more gamealtering changes than the one proposed hereall the previous nano nerfs are nothing compared to this because none of them made speed tactics obsoletedual mwd raven nerf was kind of big but again it was a very targeted change it doesnt quite match the scale of current nerfthe 50 hp buff was big effected everybody  it killed sniper eagle as viable pvp ship effected other snipers negatively but sniping didnt die it still plays key role in fleet warfare hp buff also made small gang pvp a little tougher it encouraged blobbing just a little more but not enough to kill roamingsoon after the hp nerf with introduction of t2 cruisers in game we started seeing development of modern roaming pvp  speed tacticsthere were many nerfs ill admit they altered eve pvp focus one way or another but nothing that compares to this we are going for a total break down half the game with new system in its place its not evolution of the pvp its a replacement of one system with anotherfleet wars wont be effected much aside from more titan ddd deaths due to slower accelerating bs but small scale pvp is completely different

againstchanges as they are now are unacceptable they break far more than they fix ludicrous speed is acheivable only by very specialized expensive ships start with those very specialized set ups and work from there

i would be in favor of maybe rebalancing nanos though imho there not that big a problemi am however against the lets tie a blindfold whack the pinata with a nerfbat and see what happens  approach ccp seems intend on following it just changes to many things at once seemingly without proper consideration of the results

againstthe most fun ive had since lowsec tbhits a great way to roam and strategy rules the battlefield again rather than just blobinof course you still have nano blobs but things seem to really be in balance now to where skill matters again there are already far too many ships that simply arent usable now and this is just going to toss even more into the pile

signedif this goes ahead we are going to loose a great aspect of eve combat countering nanos has never been a problem it forced people to adapt and use diffrent fits if ccp gives in to the whiners ill be pretty disapointed
this isnt a nerf this is a redesign it is more likely to break far more than it fixesi think ludicrous speeds need to be fixed i think this is the wrong way to do it

devs need to focus on fixing the stuff that is already broken before they go are start breaking other stuff recoding the application to fixoffset the prevalent and increasing lag and desync should be the 1 dev priority and not just a prioritythey can worry about balancing the game features when it works properly
against the nano nerf
i support a nano nerf but this is too extreme too huge and too fastccp shouldnt be making huge sudden changes to gameplay mechanics look where that got soe and swg
moar votes
not totally against but this nerf is too overwhelming killing t2 ships in favor of another classes is not a solution i always though that nerf supposed to bring ballance delay this patch make more testing use feedback from actual testers on singularity
this issue counts as the most popular public issue for the coming august 3rd meeting so we will be discussing it ive certainly done some testing myself on sisi and id advise as many people as possible to do that too go there form up nano gangs and anti nano gangs and see if its possible now for speed to escape 00 bubble gamps make sure the bhs and devs get to see for themselves what happens basically  having a huge ass thread like this is good for highlighting the issue and now thats certainly been done  but its now time to get testing on sisi and coming up with some specific proposals for how to improve the changes suggested in the devblog
supported i want the game to stay as is i encounter too few nanos for this to be an issue for me and when i do generally we beat them with other counters if speed need be nerfed come up with another option do not slow eve down as a whole to nerf 3 or 4 ships
its an interesting idea for a rebalancing but way too drastic with effects that go beyond affecting just the targeted socalled broken gameplay mechsi would like to see many of these changes introduced but one at a time so to speak so that their real tq effects can be evaluated without breaking down major areas of gameplay for a huge amount of people to adress a type of setup that is indeed eminently counterable

bad nerf idea go back and think harder
against
just say no to the nano nerf
against
you have to keep in mind that this issue is so big that it goes beyond the quest for better game balance this issue is very much about the conflict of playstylesyou should be aware that it is possible to change a game in such a way as to make every ship balanced yet not fun to play for people whose ability to enjoy this game is at stake testing on sisi isnt going to do anything

these ideas bring eve in the wrong direction
ummm see previous posts
i am all for changing the game however we need to implement changes that promote small gang warfare as much as they do large fleet battles fw is an excellent start but they could do more with future nerfs and other modifications also each race is supposed to have different strengths and weaknesses that is the point they are not supposed to be so balanced as to be exactly the same props to ccp for constant innovation and keeping pace but come up with something that does not hinder small gang style warfare to this extenti think some of the changes are warranted but dont kill small gang abilities to fight the blob leave us some kind of option other than blobbing up right along with themagainst for these reasons
no supportthis is a typical example why democracy can be a joke hence not the best way of doing things
a vote against the nerf is a vote for smallgang pvp down with the blobcheersjonny d

skill queue ftw sure with some limitations and dual training sounds good
hmm dont give me excuses about waking up in the middle of the night to change skill is it so hard to set a longer training skill before u go to bedi always have one long skill and few shorter ones i skill shorter ones during my actual gameplay and longer while i sleep go to vacations and suchtbh i would use skill queue just for staying away longer period and account inactive atm i am really not in the mood for playing coz its always lagy during my playtime so if i had skill train queue i would simply put two 14days skills into training and it doesnt matter if they both train at the same time with half speed or they are truly queued i would just let my subscription run out and come back 28 days later to see if anything changed
thisi would only maybe support a skill queue if it was like mentioned in the op 2 skills can be queued they train at half speed until the shortest one finishes and then that one trains at full speed againedit after thinking about this a bit more i think i might also support a queue that allowed an 18 hour queueup or something similar depends on how its implemented but that might be a workable solution

its over a year i have this plugged into my head doin nothin  pls fix

i agree only if the cargo bay is the size of a retriever cargo bay and it automatically packages ore in full jetcan containers every 4 minutesalso it may be flown in hisec  but it will be redflashy to everyone
i dont mine but i know a man who does plus its chribbas suggestion so i just have to support this fighter sized mining drones would be a great addition too
absolutely agree if for whatever messed up reason there must be a compromise at the very least let covops ships pilots not show up in local
i think that to implement this would require a complete overhaul of the scanner which would probably include a feature to scan for active ships in the system    which would result in the same information anywaysand i dont think the presence of local chat has a particularly detrimental affect on cloakers either knowing that someone is in system doesnt tell you anything other than that someone may have noticed you enter they could be cloaked off a gate they could be ratting in a belt they could be docked in a station or they could be sitting at another gate or a planet or a moon or a pos you can try scanning them out but you wont find them and youll assume theyre somewhere else you can try probing them out but youll get the same results you know somebody is somewhere but you dont know anything more until they uncloak the idea of using a chat channel for intel does bug me a little but i feel that it would be redundant to scrap it in favor of an ultimately identical feature in the scanner if we want to overhaul the scanner and find cooler things to do with it then having that new functionality replace local chat might be interesting but i think any changes to this system should originate with discussion about the scanner and only affect changes to local chat incidentallyand if you need an rp reason to justify it each ship has a comm system capable of making links and communicating instantaneously across the cluster theres actually a funny little article on it here since all of the ships individual communications are ultimately networked together sort of like the internet cough cough its clearly possible to scan for all connections originating in the same starsystem sort of like pinning down the location of someones internet connection in order to cut ones self off from the link and render ones self invisible to the chat channel one would have to close off all connection to the communications net this would involve severing connections to the chat channels fleet coms the market the map the assets tab the wallet    even iff tags on ships and the identifier signals of scanned ships and stations we can call this maneuver logging off since a ship severed from the communications network is useless for nearly anything besides hiding this maneuver is nearly always accompanied by the pilot shutting down the ships power systems rendering it effectively invisible
this is a pretty good rp reason for it if not an excellent one read the link its a good one i actually hoped ccp had something like this so this makes me  this however would just be terrible software engineering in a universe with lasers in space and warp technology the first part is sufficientsolid post though and keep local
local as it is now should definitely be removed i agree that it should show the amount of ships in the system with no ifs nor buts it also should show the corp and alliance members in the list but thats about it
supportedjust show local numbers job done
this is an excellent idea and really fulfills the unknown feeling of space using the constellation channel one could see how populated it is and an influx obviously signals a enemy gang and while you dont know where they are they dont know where you are either it would require the use of actual scouting not just an alt jumping into system and reporting what local says small cloaking ships would be invaluable for covering gates stations pos etc to gain intel on enemy movements i think this brings a new level of strategy to the game and as mentioned earlier makes this much more realistic this is one of the best suggestions i have read on these forums and i would love for this to go through
why is it so hard to understand that the feature in the scanner would not be identical to the current local this info would be available at limited range unlike the current local that gives this information at infinite rangesee the difference limited vs infinitei hope that was clear
not reallyif we start on the rp path someone would have to explain why the local intel on a particular system is not available in other systems not even in delayed form what with the ftl comm and stuff surely this would be as simple as providing market listings across the region
this change will just make blobbing even more the answer to everythingyou wont know who you are going to face or how many friends your enemy has so the best bet is to bring as many buddies as possiblethis is realistic but not fun
this really depends on for example how the new scanning system is implemented blobs may be made to have some considerable visibility disadvantages making them easily avoidable
indeed how is it that in the several thousand years humanity have advanced in eve theyve completely lost the ability to make active radar systems with fof built in that said eve already has the ability to not display the members of a chat group log into help and try to view who else is in it for an example why not just set local to the same unavailable mode as help and leave it at that

i havent even participated in the potentially but thanks to lag not at all epic fleet battles but even more moderate sized engagements get lagged up sometimes the node slows to a crawl even outside battles and mission hubs ive lost more isk to getting lagged out and dropped from the server and just lagged out long and badly enough i might as well have been and then boom than i have in all my pve activities in eve finally the marquee fleets are aspirational watching them on youtube reading about knowing theyre going on in the backgroundeven those of us who do not participate in the giant fleets or live in motsu and jita are effected by this the two most important things for keeping the game fun are balance which ccp has shown an incredible devotion to working on whether or not one agrees with their decisions and lag control new content is very nice but keeping the core of the game viable is key
is the primary point though to fix lag or to make largescale engagemenets fun again whether you have lag or not massive fleet engagements under the current rules dont look like any of the awesome space battles we dream of what it looks like is well    have any of you ever played starcraft and had a couple fleets of twentyodd battlecruisers shoot at each other thats hardly epic either in fact    remember that mission where you have to go capture a bunch of battlecruisers and then another big fleet of them comes in to fight you that fight right there is one of the greatest disappointments of my childhood ccps talked about trying to fix this all the time youll notice in the factional warfare thing which would presumably be one of the fluff bits theyre adding instead of fixing the lag changing system occupation involves hitting and holding multiple capture points for a period of time now fws still in a sort of fetal stage and nobody cares about capturing systems and pvp pilots sure as hell dont want to sit on a box repulsing rats for fifteen minutesbut    picture an engagement on a massive scale with ships fighting over multiple points across several adjacent systems capital ships blazing away at capturable targets while their support fleets scramble to fend off incoming targets territory gained and lost reserves brought in and sent to the front lines while the commanders try and keep ships on as many points as possible without spreading themselves too thin doomsday weapons employed tactically instead of strategically falling upon a point which is about to be overrun and levelling the playing field for both sides fleets are still big battles are still epic and large fleet combat is actually more interesting then a bunch of battleshipscapitals sitting on one grid and focusfiring each other to death one at a time oh and lags better too since you arent just packing as many ships as possible onto one grid anymore this is what ccps trying to do its what theyve been talking about whenever i read a dev blog on the subject and what theyre trying to prototype with the factional warfare thing is it in a workable shape yet nope is the current setup in the fw arena going to bare any similarity to what finally gets shipped out to 00 as new territory mechanics probably not but ccp is working on it because they want things to be awesome too arguably theyve got an even bigger stake in it than we do
i agree but didnt see this thread and ended up writing my own
1400mm artillery increase the damage modifier producing volley damage of 7000 w t2 guns decrease the rof slighty to maintain a consistent dps value1200mm artillery increase tracking to make it comparable to railguns and lasers increase rof slighty to add some dps and allow for better gang use reducing range and increasing clip size could help create a better mid range weapon leaving the range to railguns and dps to lasersi feel these changes are very appropriate and would allow for more effective artillery the boost to damage on the 1400mm guns is not enough to negate the recent hp boost but enough to reinstate minmatar as the alpha kings currently lasers and missiles can match and exceed artillery alpha leaving artillery weapons with no defining factor railguns rangelasers dpsartillery artillery needs a role and it currently is outclassed in every respect
in the light of the upcoming speed changes i think its more vital than ever to push ccp to make this change sooner rather than later since there will need to be some alternatives to going through bubble camps in the post speednerf age hence ive added this to the agenda for sunday as a separate issue from the blackops ships we discussed in the first session and id love to be strongly arguing that this gets to tranquility beforeat the same time as the finished speed nerf patch

new ideas are the best too bad this is not a new idea thumbs downnerfing local somehow yes please but since there are no many ways to do it like remove it completely or just leave it there its better to be kept as it currently is
pirate ganker types have been moaning about local for years its been a bad idea the whole time give it up already
signed what carrier eleven saidccp already gave you pirate ers the new militia system so what do you want now forget it if you cannot get a ratter that simply uses its brain you just had bad luck and thats it live with it and search in the next system and stop whining that you dont get targets  other peoples do so it actually cant be the local
local  immediate channel brokenlocal  recent speakers channel fixed
we can leave local in empire as it is so you can safely carebear through there lots of veld to be mined no risk no isk how about thatyaaaaaaarrrr
up for this as always
unless another means of gathering intelligence is implemented local channel needs to remain in the game as soon as alternative means become available i am all for reducing local chat to gridstation range with only recent speakers showing upbut with the one sided proposition of the op i cannot agree
well your idea wouldnt work for 00 space anyway because dont they have a system scanner in some poss in alliance spacethat would put the alliance at an advantage while putting the curious explorer at a diadvantage
supportwell change it to delayed mode show how many in system but not who they are unless they talktoo many isk farmers now have little programs etc when they set off an alarm to alert them everytime a hostile jumps in tehy hear it and warp and cloak i think this is still in effect good fast scanning is a skill and one of the few remaining skills that actual people can have left in the game make local delayed etc and people wont get warning who is in their spacei mean 00 is supposed to be dangerous isnt it
however even considering you have a lot of luck high sec or low sec exploration wont come close to the income you get from missions exploration gives increasing amount of rewards when you go from high sec to low sec to 00 exploration is competitive as there are limited amounts of complexes and they are open to others in other words exploration follows the same principles as ratting mining etc that for some mysterious reason should not apply to missions
most of the ideas you esmenet are selling are utter crap sorry to say this is so blatently an attempt to make a particular facet of the game you enjoy be more profitable and thereby better for you namely explorationits been a while since i have seen a more selfserving thread you started out missioning and now you have discovered exploration and you want it to get a massive boost just be honest and admit it that would save us all a lot of timemissions have recieved a iskhour nerf in 4 out of the last 5 major patches ccp obviously agreed with you at least in principle and have hit mission isk rates hard with the nerfbat several times over the past 2 years already but enough is enoughsome people use missions as a way to pay for their pvp exploits others use them as a way to gain capital for their trade empires others use them as a way to speed up their rd efforts still others use them as a primary way they enjoy the game believe it or not the list goes on and on as to why missions in thier current form are important to evewhether you or i for that matter like it or not missions are a corner stone to the foundation concept and economy of eve as a whole you mess with that in the way you are suggesting and it will be a game killing event end of storynow go post a boost exploration thread and gain a little respect from me in the honesty catagoryno support actually vote against if that option was available but the one wise thing you did was put on your suit edit i just wanted to make it clear that i am not against exploration getting some much needed love i think it should very soon and much of it but the approach you are taking is just wrong why do you have to take away from one group of players so you can have what you want like i said above just post your desire for an exploration boost and not cloak it with this crap in order to draw in support from the mission runner haters
i dont do exploration at all i do missionsratting for my iskso far not a single one has managed to or even attempted to explain why missions should be unlimited and without any form of competition unlike any other form of making isk in eve noone has attempted to explain why missions should not follow the regular riskreward ratio that follows with security rating of the system but i guess its easier to just accuse me of random things rather than try to answer these questions
not until you get into the large amounts of capital can you even begin to compete on an hour per hour basis with mission running and chain ratting
several billions i want what youre having the absolute best you can hope for is around 1 bil for a 1010 complex in 00 which is rare and requires other people thus splitting the profits remember i also said lowsec exploration you cant even hope to get that in lowsec even 00 exploration isnt as profitableeasy over time as hisec missionrunning try again
missions are boring so whats the point of changing riskreward balancef1f8 at some npcs while watching local isnt any more fun than f1f8 in empire
ok here we go first let me get this straight you claim that you dont do exploration and that missions are one of your primary forms of income yet most of your points in the first post are about replacing the current mission system with what exactly oh yeah exploration expansions then on top of that you are complaining about the fact that you are making too much isk running your missions so all of these complaints from you are for what the good of the community and you wont be getting a single thing out of these suggestions of yours riiiiighti accused you of being deceptive and selfserving before now i know you are a liarnext you are acting like you deserve some form of explination to things you dont understand well this may come as some suprise to you but ccp isnt exactly into giving the players what they deservefinally you talk about missions being unbalanced with regard to risk vs reward like it is some kind of fact again this may come as some suprise to you but ccp and i disagree with you about that specific point otherwise the missions wouldnt exist as part of the game so stop talking about your opinions like they are facts and deserve some form of respectmoving on i am done with this drivel
i do exploration and follow enough both the threads about exploration and the exploration channelas in other things ccp like the 1 find in a thousand worth billions balance the crap rewards in the other 999 so far i havent been one of the lucky finders but different people has reported multiple times multi billions finds in high sec 1010 complex arent always the best btw the race make a lot of difference even when they were static complex some 710 was better than some 1010 i think the people reporting multi billion finds are saying the truth it is simply a very rare event requiring generally several escalations in expeditions so very rare naturally you are free to think they are exaggerating what they found
i agree this needs to be fixed right away
this may be minor but your arguments make sense1
missionrunning is not everythingcovetor is fine it obsoletes the retriever theres no reason you would ever use a retriever instead of a covetor the covetor however is cheap and insurable compared to the hulk so people would use it for 00lowsec mining if lowsec mining ever gets fixed anyway
well no its not but neither is pvphowever pve make a better analogy then pvp and even there it can be argued that bigger is better i mean how many frigates do you see in pvp in low sec at least i mostly see battleships and people who havent gotten to battleship yet with occasional hacs or cssin that case why bother having the retriever or procurer it sounds like under your argument all mining needs is the covetor and hulk and anyone not willing to invest the sp into one of those two ships should just not bother miningmy original point is that having a stepping stone with a smaller gap benefits people other then macro miners and that other ship classes generally do have a more gradual progression the people it doesnt benifit are the hard core miners who are just going to skill up for a hulk anywaywith the mining ships its procuer and retriever a the same time 6 weeks then all other mining barges
lots of good ideas even though ive only read some of it hey its a long threadi havent seen this one here though  how about effective escortsright now its basically impossible to escort a freighter successfully perhaps something could be done to allow ships which could defend the freighterhauler in this way teamwork could play some element in the mixin addition since it isnt simple to defend other ships from massed fire the theft of cargo could also trigger aggro on the escorts allowing them to defend the loot after concord shows up if the theft cannot take readily take place then much of the ganking will stop if that last gets looked it itll have to be slower to do a transit of goods or itll just be grabwarp and the aggression timer wont help as the ship will be gone transferring cargo shouldnt be instantaneous and a timer would help here perhaps a certain amount of m3 per second so you could grab and flee with small high value items but not with a hold full of packaged hacsi also fully support all of the original suggested solutions by ccp they sound great to memind you  making concord less of a deus ex machina and letting the pirates try and dodge them etc and players support them would even be a better and more fun solution for all concerned but that doesnt seem likely
coad is the sewer pit of the forums nothing constructive or even interesting is ever posted there i have no interest in visiting coad let alone posting there even though i was active in a 00 alliance for a long time hell even scrapheap challenge  who create an atmosphere of smack talk and silly obnoxiousness on their forums  banned their version of coad because it was nothing but mindless juvenile flaming garbage like the one here give fw its own forums for tactical reasons if nothing else it should have stickies for maps active player corps etc
im against any form of capture the flag in space this is eve not counterstrike while i welcome the discussion of any ideas regarding improvements to 00 they should be creative and within reason nobody is going to want to play capture the flag on 1000 gates every single day if you want to play capture the flag join factional warfare while there arent many in 00 completely happy with the status quo i dont see anyone racing to play capture the flag in fw either and abandoning their spaceill read the proposal again and give it significantly more thought but heres a counterthought for you in the meantime 00 is hard building a corp that is capable of holding it is hard its supposed to be that way its not going to be everybodys bag and many of you are going to fail at it or be incapable its a reward not a birthright theres nothing about eve that entitles you to 00 perhaps i could offer some more suggestions regarding gate control which are more reasonable once ive digested it a bit
point this out if i missed it by why is this getting priority over other discussions when its from the corp one of the csms and he has less than 30 supports most of them from his own corp and his own alts
trolling is prohibitedapplebabe
wheres the thumbs down this is a horrible idea
chances are that the people demanding a 00 revamp are the people that would never survive 5 minutes in 00 much less have actually been in 00shocking developmentif youre going to demand a thorough revamp of 00 ask the people that live in 00 about how it currently functions rather than a group of people that have absolutely no idea how it actually functionsi stopped playing counterstrike for a reason and if this capture the flag in space nonsense goes through the sound youll be hearing is the massive amount of 00player subscriptions being canceled because empire people didnt know what they were talking about and broke the 00 game
i dont disagree but i think theres an important difference between win this minigame and you own this space and exert control over important locations to reap a benefit from them i also think the counterstrikeinspace or capturetheflag analogies are weak in general and certainly dont apply herethe principal concept at work with the stargate capture portion of the proposal is that one of the building blocks of sovereignty is exerting control over borders and routes of travel within your space in the absence of that control the assertion of sovereignty is harder to make in game terms what it really comes down to is  if you have enemy gangs infiltrating your territory undisputed can that territory really be said to be yoursto specifically address the 1000 stargates a day question keep in mind that recapturing is only necessary when a gate has been contested so the amount of recapturing a defender would have to do would be directly related to the number of enemy gangs they allow to roam through their spacein addition the specific times involved can be adjusted to tweak how long it takes to disrupt a defenders control  maybe stargates need to have a 48 hour contested period instead of 24 hours to give defenders more time to respond etci do think the strength of the overall proposal is that sovereignty becomes a more modular affair that includes pos warfare as well as establishing military infrastructure outside of poses and general patrols and gate control so it more realistically models all the things a territorial power needs to do to hold on to their space rather than making it about just one thing
of all the mindless  in 00 were forced to deal with you want to play capture the flag now with stargates
ccp asked us for vision this is vision and remember there is no obligation for csm delegates to ensure that x levels of support are present in the threads they advocate whatsoever all it needs is that the issue thread must have stood for public debate for 7 days and that a delegate is prepared to document the issue and present it the rest of the csm for a formal vote i think youll find this weekend a couple of other issues with similar levels of support on the vision tag  such as banes titan conceptcarrier discussion neither of them have overwhelming public support but they are vision issues and bane has a perfect right to bring them up for vote to see if they go on the agenda end of the day darius and i will probably be disagreeing on the sovereignty revamp proposal but thats cool its why we have delegates from all sides of the community and itll come down to voting on sunday to see if the csm is prepared to collectively endorse or not so lets quit it with questioning the right for csm delegates to advocate issues as they see fit please ultimately its what we were elected to do promote issues from our parts of the community and specialist experience and the safety valve is that we need to convince 59 fellow csms to get this stuff furtherim personally very happy with the discussion that has gone on in this thread so far and consider the proposal represents a positive direction for sovereignty warfare in eve and id love to present it to the development team in its current form for further discussion and detailed balancing
why do you want this change to go throughas we all know star fraction isnt a 00 entity and youve sunk down to mercenaries by wardeccing goonswarm your ceo jade constantine and our ceo darius johnson are both csm delegates do you think this is something a guy his jcs position should be doing
how about you leave 00 warfare to those who actually participate in 00 warfare
how about you leave this thread to discuss the topic in the op
but guys guys i wardecced you i count for something

how about you explain why you thought wardeccing another csms alliance was a good idea i dont usually read this  forum so i dont know if youve tried to justify your decision
i already said its crap what more do you want to me sayhis vision is way to specific to mean anything it should be a very general statement something along these kinds of linesthe current sovereignty mechanics with pos warfare are antiquated and should be changed the only reason to hold space to get access to moons there should be more benefits to owning space
this is a great idea ive been looking for a way for ccp to completely destroy eve and have to restart everything in eve 20then again eve 20 would probably be just as bad
maybe theyd buff assfrigs in eve 20 rite
actually the broad version of this topic was discussed in iceland and ccp said in this minutes thread that they wanted to hear more specific proposals from the communityim happy to include constructive feedback earlier in this thread people contributed some valuable feedback that i think really improved the proposal
one of these days assfrigs will get buffed and be the overpowered ship just you wait
kelsinjericho fractionthe star fractioni mean no offense but i belive that 00 advice should be made from corps and groups that live in 00 i mean if you dont appear on the influence map then you dont know enough specifics about 00 to suggest changesi myself have never left empire and know so little about 00 life that it would be arrogant to impy major changes to 00 life when i dont know what im talking aboutjust my input
course by that logic only people talking about nano ship nerfs should be those that fly nano ships or know how to fight them right 
if i wanted to play battlefield id play battlefield not eve online it helps if you have experience with what youre talking about otherwise you end up with eftwarriors like goumindong
i think the only criteria on which to judge a proposal is the content of the proposal itself ill certainly continue to incorporate constructive feedback
because people have to fight against them i dont understand the nano problem myself there are plenty of ways to counter them 00 is supposed to the the thing you do when you a big alliance to have affect on the game if you cant cut it in the current 00 then you should not be trying to change its ways just so you can participate
i can appreciate the attempt and i like that you are trying to break up the blob however the proposal shows a lack of experience in 00 and a lack of understanding of how 00 works if i understand the gate section properly you would basically allow any small gang to run around contesting gates and making defending space based largely on how many gangs you allow to run through your space gangs run through space all the time this would make defending your gates require a nearconstant defense gang and you still wouldnt be able to drive out these gangs if you owned a single system or two this seems potentially feasible but even then youd need to basically have a gang committed to running around chasing people off and reclaiming gates all the time
yes and by that logic you shouldnt be posting 5 page diatribes with an alt of yours trying to fake support with your small empire corp
while some of this idea could be implemented if this whole idea was implemented in its current state i would just go around all day constesting space in my cloaked insured t1 ships
hey ccp dont forget to send ded mails everytime a stargate is contested
under the current proposal contesting a gate requires a minimum number of ships and a certain amount of time and the contested period is intended to be of a sufficient duration to give defenders adequate time to reclaim a contested gate i think those factors combine to avoid the need for a constant defensive effort but do require a consistent defensive effort  which i think is validthe times needed to contest a gate and the length of the contested period can also be tweaked to afford defenders a larger window to either directly attack an enemy gang contesting a gate or to come along later to reclaim a contested gate
this is far too much hand holding in 00 the whole idea of 00 is cut throat players and large alliances you empire dwellers whined about it and got faction warfare to help tide you over now you want to dumb down 00 so your small alliance can take part either get some allies and try to etch yourself out a part of it or just play faction warfare for that 00 feeling to a lot of us out here the whole draw is the epic feeling of a large space battle while it may end up a slide show its still fun to take part i dont see much reason to play if you are going to dumb it down to wow battlegrounds in space instead of ruining 00 why dont you propose to create a new type of lowsec where this can occur maybe have the rewards of this area be between 00 and lowsecleveling the playing field between big and small alliances for a sandbox style game is pretty absurd especially since this game is still around due to all of the happenings of the great war in 00 and random articles and coverage that spawned from it a lot of new players joined from hearing about how epic it was take that away and you are left with a pretty substandard mmo in space
introducing a broader array of elements to territory control doesnt change the harsh and brutal character of 00 warfare if anything taking the battles beyond just pos to take place around stargates and tactical arrays as well only presents the opportunity for more and better combat
the issue that i personally draw with your gate capture proposal is not the number of ships required to capture a gate or the time required to capture a gate but the concept of gate capture itselfyou accept the conclusion drawn by ccp that 00 warfare is one dimensional and you are trying to remedy that however gate capturing only artificially creates more dimensions you are substantially adding to the boredom and tediousness of 00 warfare not removing it all you are doing is forcing people to play what is in essence a glorified game of capture the flag in order to prevent their space from being compromised by a roaming gang of 10 peopleyou shouldnt force people to participate in capture the flaggate in order to maintain a serious claim in a region 00 claims should be maintained through tangible logistic effortspos maintenance and the ability to defend your logistics supply linespeople dont patrol their space because when they are attacked they are attacked by a serious force this mechanic would only serve to encourage griefing by small corps to harass 00 occupants rather than to encourage a need to patrol spaceif you would like to encourage small gangs in the area of both offense and defense you should relate it to these logistics supply lines bubbles in 00 and their resulting gate camps is an exceptional example of an effective means of doing so which disrupts the flow of people and all kinds of supplies into 00 without drastic measures such as jump capable shipsit would be nice to fix 00 warfare to be less boring but this would only at to the tedium rather than take away from itedit i am not defending 00 warfare in its current state i do think it gets repetitive to shoot at a corps poss all day every day in an effort to capture a region and that 00 should be looked at but maybe you should look at the causes of the boringnesseverything in 00 being related to sov and sov being exclusively related to poss rather than the symptomspeople only fight over poss so we should create more things you have to do to protect your possedit 2fantastic now in addition to horribly laggy fleet fights at poss we can have horribly laggy fleet fights at stargate and tactical arrays
well two responses herefirst the call by ccp was for a layered model that presented small ship objectives that are independent from pos warfare and i dont believe that attacking pos logistics is a viable outlet for small ship combat in addition it doesnt fulfill the request for layers because its still all about possecond theres no comparison to capture the flag  that game bears no functional resemblance to what is proposed here
x  x here if you do not want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on
chucking out the current sovereignty system is not what ccp seems to be asking giving small ships a role doesnt have to change into fw gameplay in 00 00 is about building space castles and conquering said castles small ships already have a role in pvp but due to ccps function creep design philosophy  bigger has become better ccp needs only to change this by buffing small ships and reintroducing some real advantages to flying small ships not change the gameplay to account for errors in game design dont throw the baby out with the bathwaterthis proposed change seems to be too drastic a change to all the 00 entities that have built or conquered 00 space merely to let others who couldnt succeed under the present mechanics to now be able to play a role
so from the main points to conquer any space you need a big enough gang to take the stargate initially this is given as 10 people now taking this gate pretty much involves sitting very still in a confined location making you a snipers wet dream if youre moving youre going to be turning a lot and theres no danger of you warping out while mr rokh sits at 200odd km off slinging fire at you along with that if you do only have 10 people or only a few more you can be neutered by any sort of suicide tactics after all as long as the defenders get you below 10 people there theyre golden so in the end it becomes a war of attrition which means it just starts to come down to who can field more appropriate shipsnow at this point you will probably say something like yes but while this is happening they can be attacking a bunch of other gates as well well whoopdeingdo so instead of a big fleet fight involving 250 ships on each side you get one group dropping small gangs on a series of gates and a big fleet of people on the other side travelling between them with a group of 10 newbies trailing behind in cruisers reclaiming the gates theyve just wiped clean assuming they were held long enough to even flipthe only way to keep a gate will be to have enough ships to defend it the only way to do that will be to have a blob eve is mobile warfare not static sticking a fleet of 100 people in one system doesnt stop that same fleet being 30 systems away in 10 minutes time then even when you do successfully claim a gate you then have to hold it for 24 hours so their gang cant come in and retake it in half the time it took you so that fleet not only can come and wipe your small gangs off the map it has twenty four hours to do it in you cant blob a gate for 24 hours then you cant hold or even take 00 space hooray for reducing the impact of timezonesi completely fail to see how any of this will make 00 a more viable option for smaller newer corps
this whole thing sounds terrible and wouldnt really increase the purpose of small gangs
this proposal still suffers from the same problem as it did last time you posted it and when nozh posted it before gatecamping is boring gatecamping is more boring than pos shooting because at least the pos shoots back its become a necessary evil because its one of the few ways for players to catch hostiles and force them to fight or at least gank careless haulers and ratters but enforcing gatecamping on the attackers not as a means of stopping the defenders getting in but slotting in a boring first step to unlock a boring second step is not progress in the development of pos warfare
yes i cant wait to play domination  capture the flag in space this is a wonderful idea and i cant see any reason why it wouldnt be considered to be as annoying as hell for anyone that wanted to have more than two or three constellations under their controlin fact this entire proposal seems to want to force people to run around fighting fires instead of engaging in largescale epic combat that when its not laggy is actually funof course the reason for suggesting this becomes clear when one considers the star fractions stellar record at interstellar combat id be willing to wager that this fine product from the jade constantine nonsense factory goes the same way as his wonderful and wellthought out proposal to blow up outposts
this sounds pretty boring actually and how would this increase small gang warfare it would just encourage people to camp gates for 10 minute spans attackers would do it in their prime defenders in theirs whats the point it seems like this is just meant to be an annoyance for 00 space owners star fraction should try to own some 00 space before making attempts at changing the structure of 00  in the future i hope anyone making proposals about 00 to be familiar with it first
hi i am a member of worthless alliance ive never heard of and i want to get involved in 00 my alliance is pretty terrible but i want to control some 00 space and the last time i tried i got blown up these rules are completely unfair and as csm fuhrerforlife i want you to completely rework 00 ignoring all those other details like good alliances because worthless alliance ive never heard of deserves a shotps i would like to completely blow up the rules of empire because i dont like how it currently works because worthless alliance ive never heard of thinks its boring in empire
the entire thing about stargates is terrible all these timers are terribleif you really think this is going to happen specialy if the structures are in the same system you really dont have a clue
carriers within eve are setup totally wrong carriers are the end game ship  this should not be the case carrier realistically should be weak fragile ships in eve a carrier can have the effective hit points of 2 million is totally wrong however ccps role for carriers has caused this issue so lets look at carriers as they should befirstly what is a carrier in real life an carrier is a warship designed with a primary mission of deploying and recovering aircraft acting as a sea going airbase aircraft carriers this allow a naval force to project air power great distances without having to depend on local bases for staging aircraft operationsthats what a carrier should be in eve but the core issue with the carrier class is one ship is covering the rolls of a complete class we have 3 types of battleship in eve each does a different job we should have different types of carriers escort carrierthe tier 1 carrier this ship is the logistical carrier sporting the logistical ability of current carriers it is cheaper it cant launch any fighters but can fit four racial point defence systems it is cheaper than the normal carrier but has a bigger jump range since the reduced mass a lot of pilots current use carriers to move there assets in  out of zero point zero battle carrier currentthe tier ii carrier this ship has the combat ability it is a fragile  weak ship its primary combat role is to project its combat power in the form of fighters  bombers against hostile targets within 5 lightyears these fighters  bombers require fuel therefore limiting the amount of times a battle carrier can launch its fighters  bombers to deploy its fightersbombers a cyno most be dropped  a assault carrier must cyno them into the system the target must be preset so once in they will attack a predefined target such as a cyno jammer and then leave to do this the ships must be in some kind of siege mod to maintain contact with there fighters carrier are long range ships if they find themselves on the frontline they are dead simple as that they operate far away from the frontlines  this should be reflected in eve note this would be the thanatos archon chimera  nidhoggurassault carrier tech iias assault carrier is a type of carrier employed to allow combat forces to bypass camped systems by deployment of its jump portal generator while the assault carrier resembles the escort carrier the role of the assault carrier is fundamentally different its facilities have the primary role of hosting a jump portal generator these are jump my views on carriers they are totally wrong the idea of the point defence system is to allow the carrier to destroy any large weaponry that make try kill it so to kill a carrier smaller weapons would be needed which the point defence system would have a harder time hittingbtw i build  sell carriers for a living i fly them  love them but they are overpowered  wrong
its really hard to pay any attention to some of the better points you might be making when you spout off rediculous bull like this
what youre asking for remains a request for the csm to give you blind approval on an unlimited number of unspecified proposalswhich takes this back to the problem with the original post starting this thread this is merely a rewording of the same proposal you offered in a csm meeting and which was voted down and voted down for good reason you havent changed the proposal in any way including refusing to limit your proposal to a specific set of proposals sample of your ideas how many more you have waiting in the wings to bring forth if you get an escalation approval from the csmisnt there a time limit before a proposal can be reintroducedwindjammer
your reply is typical of goonswarm you guys go to the same school for thisits hardly my fault that goonswarm is iconic for a certain demographic and im not about to start posting like they arentwindjammer
in addition i notice that there is no mention of the far from silent majority that posted against at least one of these suggestions when it was first put out by ccp zuluparkregardswindjammer
first off if the only thing approved is the carrier topic it will be the only thing discussed due to the rules i do see your qualms however a perfectly reasonable worry is that the council will ask for more background information which to anybody who hasnt flown in cap fleets before is substantial you predict that bane will bring up more and more issues along with a personal agenda but i think the delegates will have sense to keep everyone on topicit is a very chickenegg debate i think that more of the council would be willing to discuss 00 in general if more of them knew what currently goes on and how it works but unfortunately they cant until they approve of the discussion in the first place we have to try and get the ball rolling because so far the talks havent scratched the surface of the entire topicit would be nice if a portion of the csms time be devoted to discussion of 00 as there is certainly a portion of eve that spends time there give it a second chance  why not
surprised to see this particular bob member trying to shoot down banes ideas considering i happen to know that avon is a something awful member of many yearsbane as always expressed his ideas very eloquently and in such a way that demonstrates the amount of effort and thought he puts into everything he publishes for improvements to this game we all loveyes you love the game if you dont why are you reading this
stereotypes are wonderful arent they are you racist in real life as well it is pretty ignorant of you to proudly boast that you are going to continue thinking in a way that is incorrectwhether or not his response is typical or not doesnt negate the fact that he is right and that your only retort is a personal attackas for avon i certainly agree that you shouldnt throw out something like majority unless there is something quantifiable to back it up on the other hand avon you did it yourself by flipping it to minority in either case it is a petty thing to quibble over the point is that there is a part of the population that has concernand now to the point at hand banes own idea certainly moves carriers into a fleet support role however as some have already mentioned doesnt take into account the personal aspect of flying a ship ie why have fighters if the carrier pilot cant make use of them himself or even to the extent that you would expect something named carrier to be capable ofthe issue is certainly worthy of discussion as many things are rebalance is a tricky one but to cover your eyes simply because it works for you is short sighted i think arbitrarily saying a carrier cannot rep another when in new triage is silly personally if it works when not if there are side effects of new triage that make it neigh on impossible to do so that is different
1 goonswarm just wants carriers to be easier to train for so they can get more of them2 goonswarm just wants carriers to be less powerful so they dont need to get more of themlook at how stupid you are
this post hits the nail right on that was the exact reason the proposal was turned down in the first placebut at present there is not a time limit before it can be reintroduced
the carrier topic as bane has outlined is everything to do with carriers that is to say everything that has anything to do with carriers is open to presentation to ccp if bane gets the approval for escalation from the csm that he seeks nothing will be excluded or limited bane is not even limiting himself to the rather wide range of ideas hes presented in his posts he says theyre only a sampleideas and proposals for carriers cover a very wide area you wouldnt expect a csm delegate to make a proposal to discuss the problems of the entirety of eve with ccp neither should you expect a csm delegate to ask for and receive escalation approval to discuss everything that comes to hisher mind regarding carriers especially when he refuses to limit himself to previously announced specifics even ccp requires the csm to specify components of a proposal prior to a csmccp meetingyou say the delegates would have the sense to keep everyone on topic thats just it the topic would be to discuss carriers nothing to do with carriers could be considered to be off topicas it happens there are easy answers to the chickenegg debate the answer depends upon whether you believe in creationism or evolutionnothing is preventing the csm from discussing anything they are free to discuss everything they can do so amongst themselves or here on the forums or in any other of a number mediums again you have in a way discovered the problem bane does not seek to discuss these issues with the csm delegates or anyone else prior to presenting them to ccp at a csmccp meeting he seeks blanket apporval to present his ideas and the ideas of those he agrees with and to do so without risking a discussion or vote on what hes going to presentof course the csm should discuss 00 issues dont you think they should discuss them before voting them approved for escalation you wouldnt purchase a car you hadnt seen or driven you wouldnt purchase a house that hadnt been inspected why would you purchase an unseen bunch of ideas without discussing thembane has failed to bring new evidence to the table showing the csm made a mistake the first time they voted this downwindjammer
you know a lot of these problems would take care of themselves if zulupark and nozh just suddenly and irreversibly found themselves unemployedi honestly wish those types of proposals would fit into the ccp defined narrow scope of the csms purviewyeah i know off topic but still blissful thoughts ehcheers
i hope your words were merely ill considered and i await your apology the alternative is that they are the single most profoundly baseless and ignorant thing i have ever seen posted upon these or any other forums being the author of something like that isnt a prize to be enviedin the us there are two main political parties the republicans and the democrats the republicans are iconic of one demographic and the democrats of another it is not considered racist to say so why because the demographic is a gathering of people who have made a choice to behave live and vote in a roughly similar way it has nothing to do with the color of their skinsimilarly nothing ive said about goonswarm is incorrect or based upon the color of anyones skin it is based upon the fact they have chosen to join an alliance which has a certain set of well known behaviors and composition some of these are legendary they are displayed within goonswarm in the entirety of eve and easily seen in the posts made here on these forums actions and words presented for anyone who wishes to see themi doubt you would call me racist for saying jade constantine is a member of a certain demographic role players or that avon is a member of a certain demographic nor would you label me with such a vile allegation for commenting on the preferences of such demographicsi see hes right because you say so his personal attack on me is justified and no doubt in your mind eloquent i on the other hand am not entitled to issue a similar attack in response ohand youre justified in throwing around allegations of racist bahaviour do i have that just about rightwindjammer
yeah im the stupid one1 goonswarm does want more of their pilots able to fly carriers and other capitals that way goonswarms higher numbers will have more effect against lower numbers of more highly trained individuals this is not saying that there wont still be many within goonswarm who dont train for capitals or who are a long way from capital training even with the reductions in skill training bane is seeking2 goonswarm does want carriers to be less powerful so that all those in goonswarm who arent trained for carriers andor capitals see above will be able to hold sway over carriers and capitals with sheer numbers 2ayou have to look at the specific ways that are being sought to nerf carriers ie nerfing them to be logistic support for smaller ships at the expense of being effective combat ships in their own right this tends to cover items one and twoits a two pronged attack upon a goonswarm problem low numbers of highly trained pilots defeating large numbers of lesser skilled pilots attacking this problem from both ends to achieve a minimization of defense against high numbers of lightly skilled pilots if either of these attacks is successful goonswarm wins if both attacks are successful goonswarm still winsthey just do it fasterbut then thats just me and as you so aptly pointed out with your study of the situation im stupidwindjammer
id personally be happy with zulupark going back to quality control ive no wish to see the guy unemployed i just think hes a bad fit for his current jobas far as nozh is concerned there were 4 of them that sat down for 5 hours i think its very unfair that nozh has to take all the heat for what they came up with in that short space of timewindjammer
just nerf everything that requires time while youre at it
i think carriers should be force multipliers rather than the foot soldier unit of fleets but that banes solution in the original post is too convoluted this is a serious game balance issue that is deleteriously affecting gameplay in a lot of ways i just wish a more elegant solution would present itself
agreeing with bane
given all bane is asking for is a longer discussion perhaps workshop with the devs on a particularly large and complex matter i dont see what everyones problem is im up for it
there are great ideas within the proposal but it just needs to be rephrased to clearly state the extent and limits of what a support is supporting the current phrasing is a carte blanche and that is what so many people including myself are wary of
wind i honestly wish i had your level of forgivness and tollerance for the neolithic level of stupidity and arrogance these two devs in particular have shown in recent months honestly i do i think it would make me a better personi see your point about nozh but he was the one who made the blog so its only kinda natural that he is going to get the brunt of the scorn but yeah the other three sitting at that table are just as responsible for this latest disgraceat least we can agree that zulu has no business being on the balancing team i suppose its their unflinching attitute that they know better than all the other devs that came before them that pisses me off the mostah hell what am i doing its not like anybody cares what i think or feelcheers to you for at least reading and responding to my post wind ill troll off and enjoy the speed that my ships have at the moment i know its not going to last no matter what the majority of players want
i must admit that i agree in principle with the idea from the op but he must be specific about what he is trying to achieve the op is asking for support to an issue which has no clear boundaries and therefore is saying support me to do whatever i feel is necessary if the op could look at rephrasing his suggestion to be put forward then i believe he would get a lot more support from all areas of the eve populace as it stands his ideas that he has put forward and the ideas he could put forward cannot be given viable support by the massesso quite simply bane give us a specific suggestion to agree or disagree with rather than trying to pull the wool over the ignorants eyes and getting yourself a cheap shot at changing the carrier to the betterment of goonswarm alone
im against this idea there is other more pressing issues to look at for capital ships like titans dd dmg
no support from mewhy while i agree that carriers could use some retooling the ideas that the op puts forth are too broad in scope for me to agree wholeheartedly withif bane could narrow down the scope maybe put up a few different threads each with an individual idea then we the unwashed masses could pick and choose with the way things are currently presented it is too much an all or nothing myself at this point i chose nothing
if ccp does the stuff to carriers that was being proposed in that blog i will quit plain and simple its unacceptable and is just punishing people for bothering to achieve something carriers are fine as they are now
the idea that goonswarm is still made up of newbies in t1 caracals with 2 million sp each is pretty dumb you know like i said earlier in the thread we already have loads of pilots who are carrier andor dread capable  there have been goons playing eve since the beginning long before goonfleet was formedmaking carriers easier to get into doesnt benefit us in the slightest in fact im not sure it benefits anyone but those players who train carrier alts in order to sell them on the eveo forums and if anything its dreads that were more keen to get people into as any one of the many people with access to our notoriouslyheavily infiltrated forums will tell you your tinfoil hattery is amusing but ungrounded in reality goonswarm is not high numbers of lightly skilled pilots as much as the lol t1 n00bswarm stereotype is played up we have huge numbers of characters with years of training behind them we fly supercaps and hacs and t2 sniper battleships just like every other alliance any change to carriers affects goonswarm carrier pilots in just the same way as it affects bob or roadkill or razor or any other alliances carrier pilots are other alliances somehow mentally incapable of adapting to use carriers as logistic support if such a change was madeas it happens im not yet convinced that banes specific suggestions will address the issue of carriers being the generic capforalloccasions but your paranoia that every suggestion raised by a goon is some orchestrated nerf plot to make us win more fights is pretty hilarious
carriers should be frontline vessels because who likes parking their billion isk and year training time ship at a pos then carriers can also die in combat which is more funi like a nerf to capital rr gangs these gangs are a plague to tranq and a huge source of lag and blobbage i dont like making all carriers into mothership ewar immunity that seems crazy to me maybe jammingdampening immune but for gods sake not ptweb immunebomber drones sound interesting sounds like you are taking anticarrier role away from dreadnaughts id rather give bombers to dreads so they are the offensive vessel and carriers are the support healing vessel in fact what we could really really use is a subcapital ship that excels at damaging capital shipscarriers are the new bs of 00 warfare they need to be easier to kill aka must be on the front lines they are also still swiss army knives a real shame most of the carrier fixes in said zulupark dev blog never made it to tq
another word goonswarm cant kill bob because bob have to many carriers and you want try to nerf them again
at base carriers can deploy 5 fightersdrones of their own 125mbitsec bandwidth but can still delegate up to 10 including original 5 to gang members with carrier v a mothership can use 10 fighters on its own 250mbitsec bandwidth at base but has 20 overall to use at oncewhile good in theory this would never work and if you remember correctly is also the main reason carrier changes were shot down in the past by the public so extremely as stated good theory however with the current state of lag when hopping into mass warfare carrier pilots would have no control at all with what is going on with their fighters as ppl try to warp around and all while trying to manage the fighter allocation remote rep etc this idea just doesnt workat least until something is done about the massive node lag which may never even be able to happen etcanother point is the whole making carriers easier to get into you think that if you made carriers easier for someone to get into that suddenly there would be less of them please dont take this as a bash its not meant to come off that way overall i think ccp has handled carriers just fine as of late they got rid of their hauler ability no more haulers loaded with cargo and over the years have done a pretty good job in balancing the cap fleets out capital ships such as carriers are more of an end game ship and one that takes well over 2 years to fully get into with proper skill levels in each areapeople use the term capital online and yes there are more out now but it makes sense 5 year old game however if this really was the case why doesnt everyone have one so you can counter insert random cap attack here an attack with some of your own i am willing to bet its because of the huge pain in the arse and amount of time needed to train for one correctly not just get in it
tbh this thread completely lost my attention at the word zulupark the op might get more going on here if he removed that word from the thread title and his subsequent posts
hmmmn not too sure about this take my love take my landtake me where i cannot standi dont care im still freeyou cant take the sky from metake me out to the blacktell them i aint comin backburn the land and boil the seayou cant take the sky from metheres no place i can besince i found serenitybut you cant take the sky from meiz
since you mention lotro so much ill go with that analogy as long as just like in lotro there is a switch to turn player played music very much off i dont care what you guys do with thisit does seem like a silly waste of ccp resources that they claim to have so few of when there are key elements of the game that are still broken in need of dire attention ui faults anyonebut whatever as long as i can turn you and your macarena off and am not forced to listen to it while i am in stationoh and no i wouldnt exactly call this post support so no thumbs up for you
i agree
i also agree not only is it completely out of touch with the eve realm but its a waste of resourcestry something that fits with the dark and dangerous world of eve like various forms of gambling
but look how many people want it this is getting more support than exploration ships and council of ship balances combined clearly its more important because thats what this forum is for i think thumbs up
crap idea one step away from every other carebear mmog dancing and instrument playing loops while afk add it but only if i can club them over the head and rip implants out of their skulls
actually given that this effectively kills the possibility of reliably having an invention market on this and with the nano nerf bat coming and straight dps tanking back in stylewell to be honest its a mild issue that is definately in needing of being addressed
get rid of it
indeed
i like the graphic but for some reason my sensor booster graphic has changed and it now looks like a permanent unmoving blue missile explosion graphic 
i hate it p
its ugly as hell i was at a pos shoot recently watching a bunch of sieged revelations pour beamy death into a tower despite the fact that shooting pos is boring as hell a squad of revs with broadside after broadside lancing out into the forcefield looks amazingexcept for the fact that theyre obscured by stupid blinky rings that dont clip properly seem to extend 50km out into space some times and honestly cant do much for my framerateplease make it smaller and less obtrusive
fugly tbh
agreed
carriers need this
obcourse
scan probes are a form of ammunition and can be in the hold of stored ships there was a reason for this nerf carriers had become the swiss army knife of eve if they undo this nerf then we go back to that and within a few months theyll be looking at another perhaps bigger carrier nerf do you want any of the changes from the infamous reviled dev blog instead
agreed i routinely carry lots of spare fittings on extended deployments and its a real pain not to be able to use an sma to store my ship or have it carrierjumped elsewhere because of that ditto for ozone not just for cynoships but also for taking jump bridges have fun flying fifty jumps because you had to jet your ozone to store your ship and there isnt any available anywhere by the time you get it back out
agreed
did you even read the op the replacement ships provided by ccp for importation and mineral handling outshine the prenerf carriers ability to do the same job by a significant margin with a lot less hassle and somewhat less training its not like people will start training for carriers before making the train up to jfs or rorqs in the event this change is reversed all this does is remove a lot of the hassle currently in place to prevent a now obsolete use of carriers thanks to ccp providing alternate means to complete the job
when this nerf went live it was just one in a long line of lazy balance nerfs that were poorly thought out and even more pooly implemented hell from this same patch mission runners are still dealing with people as cargo that take up 7m3 or more each on some missions a person as cargo takes up 1m3 on other missions its 7m3 and everywhere in betweem please ccp at least pretend like you know how to code your own gamethis was also promised to be fixed more than 3 patches ago in live dev blogs and has been promised to be fixed in every patch sinceget on it ccp fix this and other m3 loot maddness that you instituted on a poorly though out whim
agreed  the ozone issue affects both cyno ships and any alliance with a jump bridge network the module issue affects everyone using a smbsmanow that jump freighters and rorquals are commonly used for even moderate scale logistics theres no reason to not remove the restriction on pos fuel for carriers as well individuals and smaller corporations should be able to use carriers to move pos fuel and strontium more easily in 00 it will encourage them to expand into 00 space by requiring a more utilitarian ship carrier miners will likely still gravitate towards using a rorqual but for those who rat or do complexes they should not be required to have a rorqual or jump freighter simply to set up and service a few medium poss
agreed i somewhat understood the change at the time but everyone who plans to use one has a jf or a rorqual its time to ease the restriction on us carrier pilots who really only ever used our carriers to carry combat supplies to begin with
carriers had become the haulers of eve because there was nothing else there is something else something better now jump freighters and rorquals this change was instituted to force people to switch to those ships they have the people that have switched to them arent all the sudden going to go back to using carriers because they will never carry as much reverting this change makes those of us who use our carriers for the intended purpose have an easier time of it that intended purpose is front line logistics and combat support
i would disagree that jump freighters and rorqs are patently better than a carrier able to fit haulers with cargo in them why carriers have a longer jumprangecarriers also have the added benefit of having far more numbers in existance and use and less cost to build one reversing that nerf would put us right back in the position for a carrier to be one of the viable options for the hauling jobs it clearly wasnt intended to dothe only way i would support removing the ammoonly restriction is if only combat ships were allowed in the carriers sma ie no haulers or barges the haulers and barges could still effectively be moved in the smas of rorqsi agree the restriction is a nuisance but it fixed a real problem so the new fix should not bring back the old problem disallowing haulers in the bay is one option for solving both problems at the same time
pweese
having to move stuff between my corporate hangar and the ship cargo hold before i scoop it and after i launch it just make my day that little bit less enjoyable anyone that needs to move large amounts of stuff long distances uses jfs and rorqs and has the logistics in place to cope with the cyno chains needed this nerf just serves to annoy these days
poast
well most every one hates the speed nerf in its current incarnation i have an idea that would address the issue with out dramatically changing the dynamics of the current game play also with out destroying the effort people have made to train skills buy mods implants i started a thread in the game development forum with this idea and it was pointed out that i might want to post it here so in an effort to gain some exposure here i go  copyed from threadi have a simple and elegant solution that would address the proposed speed problem one in which i believe the player base with accept with out too much fuss and it still will address the speed issue definitively im not sure how knowledgeable you are with aeronautical terminology so i will keep things simple i propose there be a new facet introduced to all ships not just hull based and that new facet should be called vne velocity never exceed this is an actual aircraft rating in the real world in layman terms its a speed at which you start causing abnormal stressdamage to an aircrafts hull ie if you exceed the vne too much for too long the wings will rip off or cause other catastrophic damage by instituting this new dynamic you will be able to effectively kill the ludicrous speed as noted in the blog with out the huge sweeping changes that are on sisi now as an idea how this would work say a ship has a vne rating of 5kms now if that same ship exceeds that rating it would start incurring hull damage now the amount of damage incurred vrs the amount of speed over the rated vne is of course variable and just as in real shipsaircraft some hulls are built more heavily then others since this new dynamic is based in real life most every one will understand it and accept it and bluntly it just makes sense that this is how things should work just as in real life sure you can strap a mx missile to your back nothing is stopping you but youre not going to live long if you fire that bad boy off but an important effect of instituting a change like this is you can leave all the modules and implants at their current nominal values so people with snakes in their heads or people that have a lot of time in trained skills dont wined up having their efforts completely destroyed of course no one is ever happy at the prospect of having their efforts completely destroyed by the institution of a new policy i think most every one would agree that this would not kill small gang warfare but rather it would add a new dynamic to the necessary piloting skills to be successful since speed tanked ships dont fit reps having even a small amount of hullarmor damage is a huge factor in the decision making process of any one piloting a nanospeed tanked ship conversely people might actually fit remote hull repairers to their ships for after combat repairs and since these modules are very power thirsty i would not think they wouldcould be use them wile still in combat and i would bet most people would acknowledge that remote hull reps are almost completely absent from roaming speed gangs most importantly in the end analyses making a change like this adds new decision vrs penalty choice that every pilot would have to make yes people would be able to go at ludicrous speeds but not for long and not with out a penalty and as an added benefit since you are not making a huge change to the game dynamic so i would expect the resulting unexpected result of x nerf would be greatly diminishedlinkmy idea in the other forumthere has been alot of good ideas thrown out in the thread please check it out and post your thoughts
this was a lot longer until i read through the other thread short versionin space there is no air resistance so vne is not justified in an rp sense
every time some one posts this response im shocked and dismayed because this was covered over and over in the thread read please vne doesnt have to be based off of dragresistance but rather gforce loading vibration hull stress heat or any number of influencing factors or it could be based off of a combinataion of factorshell a vne could be blamed on the fuzzy dice falling off the rear view mirror any of them work but its the principal of a vne that follows logic
dont feel bad a lot of people dont understand how space workssupport but i still add that it just build up your heat meter in the middle of the ui
g force vibration hull stress and heat all come from acceleration not your top speed i would support an acceleration cap fuzzy dice i doubt anyones gonna go for that
i support this idea wholeheartedly this is brilliant in its simplicity and eleganceand most importantly it is a direct slap to the balance teams way of doing things ccps answer to perceived problems is always the same namely bring out the nerfbat and bludgeon everything in sight to deathit is so nice to see someone bringing up a possitive way to deal with this issue rather than all of this negativity we constantly get from the devslesson ccp be possitive in your solutions add new stuff to deal with issues that you perceive rather than simply breaking out the nerfbat to bludgeon the player base into submissionof course ccp is going to blatantly ignore this like the do every other good and reasonable idea that comes along but nice to see someone is actually trying thank you op
emc2as the speed of the object increases the mass of the object increases so as the speed increases the internal stresses being placed upon the ship by the creation of its own gravity well and outside sources of gravity increase along side it the ship would crush itself somewhere between a full stop and the speed of gravity not including anything else likei dont know being shot maybe agility is already addressed but as far as vne not being realistic its simply a reflection of your education that you dont know the theory of specialrelativity and how it applies in spaceoh and dont give me that its just a theory crap because its a theory until its proven right or wrong and right now its neither but it does work in newtonian physics which do apply to all things larger than the atomic level quite wellneither supporting or not supporting read the other thread and its an ok solution but it continues to add load which is something that needs to be avoided if at all possible load means more lag and we have enough of that already the calculations would have to be done server side to avoid cheating and well the rest is history
actually if you want to get really technical acceleration is one of the ways you get all of the above factors in 0g but when applied to eve combat situations the primary way you would get load stress is from rapid vector changes at those ludicrous speedsthat is why i support this idea vne is a rather simplistic way to apply a limit to the system that has a basis in reality after all most of the eve physics engine is based on what we understandstood about reality and space travel i dont think ccp would keep phd mathematicians and physicists on staff otherwise just my two isk
thank you i just wanted an idea that didnt destroy all the effort that people put in to their toonswile still addressing the issues and it just makes sencea person cant expect to just put some ungodly engine in to a car and go 6000 mph with out the car falling apart and killing the driver no matter if its a carplaneboat there is always a limit to how far you can push it
no you are skewing my logic to prove me wrong of course that would be unreasonable yet the issue here is not the velocity as you suggest but rather the radial acceleration which should definitely be limited i am not talking about change in speed im talking about change in the velocity vector as suchrapid vector change is acceleration by definition im not just talking about linear acceleration i do understand 3 dimensional vector mechanics it is this combination of speed and agility that is problematic ships could go as fast as they want as long as they turn like a tungsten school bus as limited by their maximum acceleration
i fear thats going to be the case since they already started down the hit em with the wmd of nerf bats route
a rhetorical question does not prove anything if it is rebutted the fact remains that while it may solve the problem it is more artificial than actually implementing sound mathematics and physics our individual views are the extremes and personally i think the current mechanic is a balance this is believable enough physically but simple enough for a timesensitive mmorgp
but you didnt rebut you conceded the point then you switched tacts to a different point
firstlyit is like that in real life because theres air theres none in spacesecondlythat would just mean that every ship of x type goes y speed rather than it varying based on modules skills implants etc
i think its more a case of how do you implement this system in a way that is fast efficient and does not generate any form of extra strain on the servers if at any point in developing an answer you come across the idea of major redesigning the server backend some people might find the sudden urge to kick you in the ballsack as the amount of time and money that would needed to be spent on such endeavors would far outweigh any result they will bringideas that sound nice are nice but they also need to be practical and implementable from what i read of your idea it sounds like a hell of a thing to implement without causing extra lag to a game already suffering enough of that
first read the thread vne doesnt have any thing to do with air resistance in this casesecond exactly so all the people with skills trained or alot of isk in to modsimplants dont get shafted but the speeds are still brought down so its a winwin for every one
i think its more a case of how do you implement this system in a way that is fast efficient and does not generate any form of extra strain on the servers if at any point in developing an answer you come across the idea of major redesigning the server backend some people might find the sudden urge to kick you in the ballsack as the amount of time and money that would needed to be spent on such endeavors would far outweigh any result they will bringideas that sound nice are nice but they also need to be practical and implementable from what i read of your idea it sounds like a hell of a thing to implement without causing extra lag to a game already suffering enough of thathow is that you already have a throttle that you never useand we also have the triggered event damage over loading modulesour speeds are already tracked look at your over viewthe only question comes down to how much damage vrs how much speed over vnethe tools needed to do this are already in game in one form or anotherbut as i said in the thread we would probably need a better throttle to help regulate our speeds easer
you cannot artificially set a vne in space im moving in a straight line  not practical for combat or anything but travel but im gonna do it my thrusters are activated on low  the acceleration on my ship is very small there are no other forces acting on my ship why would i eventually top out at a speedno there is no hull stress bc im accelerating slowlythere are no gforces bc i am not turning or accelerating excessively fastwhat physical property is limiting my top speed or is it purely artificialturning radius should be affected this is why you align slower as you are moving faster this is why when you try to orbit at 5km with your mwd active you dont move at top speed thing is these are currently implemented because the devs understand basic 3dimensional kinematics the fact that there is no air resistance is very very relevant vne relative to what the grid the ether please
since you seem so insistent ill answer your question but before i do i would suggest you brush up on you physicsa vne can very likely be explained by the hull stress associated with passing through the gravitational wells of all the celestial objects with in a given system however to be truly accurate ccp would need to calculate the gravity wells due to their mass of every item in a given system and plot their proximity to one another since this is not feasible a static vne makes more sense
the only time i would be passing through anything like this is during warp but at subwarp speeds i dont thing this phenonmenon is an issue show some maths saying that gravity wells arent completely negligible at current game speeds ill let you go up to 20 kms
as i said please brush up on your physics i am not going to continue a conversation with some one that is 1 looking to argue as you appear to be2 not competent to carry on the conversation first you say that there is nothing to warrant a vne now you say i dont think that is an issue with out denying the plausibility of the argument im not going to banter with you
just for kicks and giggles because i feel nice tonight here is the reference material you need to get up to speeddynamical friction
what area of science am i clearly incompetentim not doing this just to argue you may be right but you havent provided enough evidence to warrant my support or that of many others im trying to strengthen your case as an alternative to the proposal in the dev blogedit perfect thank you ill read through thatalso ive been quite clear that i dont support a vne but would support a limit on maximum net accelerationedit2 ok gave it a look sounds like this phenomenon would occur if a titan flew by a bunch of frigs dragging them along does it work the other way with ships moving relative to planets
as i said in my other thread i kept things simple for the masses since most people would be able to understand it with the analogies i used in the postps ill leave the math to you i am not nearly motivated enough on this subject to dust off my graphing calculator so i assume i have your support now edit mass is mass ill regardless of the source just remember celestial objects are orders of magnatude larger than even a titan
edit2 ok gave it a look sounds like this phenomenon would occur if a titan flew by a bunch of frigs dragging them along does it work the other way with ships moving relative to planets on that part im not convinced but ill give you my thumbs up for your massive effort here maybe this deserves some sort of consideration
see edit above
ttytt velocity never exceeds some value in case there is some major counterforce like friction in space there is no friction so the only limiting factors are the engine thrust and the mass of the ship if you install some module that gives you xx velocity this means that you increase the engine thrust if you install nanos you decrease the massif you add this vne value you may make the modules useless it is not the right way to do it you may as well add dpsne cargone sensor stengthne and so on it should not be done like this but should instead be balanced by the means of tuning the mass thrust base velocity and modules effects
edit yeah that works i dont understand how its applicable and will defer for now
if you dont read the posts you only show your lack on knowledge on this matter for gods sake at least read the link i posted there is friction in space
im not against the nano nerf but i think in general this is better very interesting read
now lets get real technical every time a ship would traverse a gravity well at an oblique angle the effective thrust vector changes as a result the ship would have to change its own thrust vector to maintain its course in effect trying to bend the shipill leave you to draw your own conclusions on what effect this would have on a ship but in my mind all these factors add up to a pretty conclusive argument for a vne
i dont mean to bump this back up as i dont support the idea but he is right there is indeed friction in spacethe idea that space is a vacuum is incorrect due to the nature of gas and matter there is no such thing as a perfect vacuum that being said there is very little resistance in space compared to an atmosphere but there is still random stuff everywherehowever i do have an additional issue with the idea that further separates me from being able to support it the problem is you must assign this damage a type and that type can also have a resistance or else you basically have to do a massive rewrite of the games dynamics from what i understand so while you would cause a problem to speeders the nature of damage would remain so that it had to pass threw the shields and armor which can in some cases have very high resistances thus making them capable of sustaining these speedsif it were somehow limited to only the hull then all you would need is a hull repper to be able to maintain a significant speed still removing one low slot will slow folks down but not a hell of a lot in some cases if the damage is still done by damage type then a dcu ii could mitigate it further and turn some ships into speed freaks while others would be hugely nerfednot a fix imho
gravity fields are not affected by shields or armor if an object has mass then it is subject to gravityat extreme scales even if some thing doesnt have mass its still subject to gravity so resistance factors are completely irrelevant you can not resist gravity and you dont mave to assign a dmg type look at over loaded modules of corse it stated as heat there is no resistance check there only a skill checkno one is saying this is a perfect out of the box idea of coarse it needs some details worked out however its a lot better then nerfing UFFFD of the modules in game and screwing over the people that spent time training skills or those people that spend huge sums of isk on implants edit hull repers are very power hungry trying to run even 1 serously gimps a speed set up not to mention the dps as well if you had actualy read the other thread you would have seen this topic has been coverd in detailedit 2 even if some one had 6 hull repers runing remember that vne is a dmg over speed ie go to far over vne and it dosent matter cause you could insta pop you self not to mention nanos reduce your hull hp
first i agree that the speed should be relative to the mass however in reality thats far from how ccp has the game set up as the caldari who historically used smaller faster more agile close range ships to fight the gallante somehow use slower larger and long range ships now shields are energy not matter and therefore have no mass yet people are complaining about the mass changes to caldari ships and the lighter caldari ships are even slower now than ever so this argument is counter intuitive to the way ccp has configured the ships entirely size and mass seem to have nothing in common with signature radius and speed despite appearing to be directly linked a rohk is huge and slow compared to any gallente battleship yet its physically smaller and lighter which makes absolutely no sense but there ya goafter seeing the changes i dont like them either but we need the correct fix the first time not the wrong fix several times until we get it righti dont care how power hungry a hull reper is if the damage is to be anywhere near realistic then its going to start low and get higher the faster you go so a hull reper gives a buffer zone in which this person can function and depending upon how fast the person wants to go they simply need more hull rep which is a form of tanking though its disfunctional at best allows a speed tanker to focus on that with 2 modules and allows his mids to be diverted to ew or cap it wont be the same but it wont be much of a nerf eitheryes nanos reduce your hull hps and yes its damage past a certain speed but your not going to insta pop and if you do i really dont like the idea because lag would kill every pilot capable of going over vnesorry but i still dont agree i would rather see ccp to fix ships to be realistic to their historical accuracy and physical parameters and properly balance the ships from there rather than nerf half the module but thats what they are going to do it appears
nerd hat ontrue that there is no air resistance but there is a relatively speaking large amount of hydrogen helium and some oxygen atoms out there in solar space  hell even in intergalactic space sending your spaceship into relativistic speeds is going subject it to some rather phenomenal impacts since at those speeds even singular atom impacts will have some rather huge energy releasesthat said eve lore avoids the ussue through utilizing warp as the solution for fasterthanlight travel and the speeds were talking about in normal maneuvering are miniscule  actually slower than the space shuttle in most casesso yeah ive always been a bit annoyed about that part of travel in eve  gief elitestyle newtonian physics engine please d
fully supported as i did in the first thread this idea should at least be talked about and thought over by ccp it may not workbe feasible in the end but its an interesting idea that presents some interesting mechanics
thank you iwe need all the thumbs up we can get lol
so anyone that disagrees with you is not only wrong but is being argumentative your incorrect during the war the reason why the gallente developed drones was to counter the small fast ships of the caldari early on the caldari focused their efforts in one man fighters but when drones were developed they increased the size shielding and firepower of those one man fighters and called them frigates they then were the first race to be given pod technology by the jovians and employed it successfully in battle against the gallente i suggest you read the chroniclesgallentecaldari war the early daysgallentecaldari war the breakoutgallentecaldari war the war drones onthe chronicles make reference to the gallente ships as slow hulking ships that are not much more than orbital bombardment platforms that being said how does a blaster shoot the in earth dimensions 160kms to the surface of the planet it doesnt a railgun can though and would be capable of covering a large area of the planets surface because it can fire from a higher altitudehow ships are currently designed and how they were from the start is not correct according to the history of the races produced by ccp whywho knows but in this i assure you i am correct why this obsession with the idea that i didnt read your other thread i did read it and your response to how lag will be a nonissue is equivalent to saying that doesnt exist at all the truth is it does and will kill pilots who try to limit their speed the lag will reduce a pilots effectiveness in using throttle and knowing how fast one is traveling will be delayed to the point where if you dont know your going really fast then you will simply pop and not know or be able to do anything about it because of the lag unless your proposing additional changes to the games ui and then thats not a simple vne change now is it signature radius is indeed based in fact if your sensors pick up gravemetric or gravity wells then your mass is what makes you a target the game was intended to work this way but it was never adopted however the principle still applies that signature radius is based on the size of a ship frigates have a very small signature radius and battleships have a large sig the problem comes when you park a rohk next to a ship that is larger in length width and height like the hyperion and megathron then and thanks for saving me the trouble of looking it up you point out that the rohk the smaller ship has more mass it has the largest signature radius too it has the same hull or less than both the mega and hyperion and less armor than the hyperion yet more mass what do the caldari build their ships out of the heaviest possible materials they can find do they use some kind of unknown material in this world that is not only really heavy but intentionally returns gigantic sensor signatures i doubt it so while it has a basis in the game on size as demonstrated it fails to follow those rules on a ship to ship basis though it does quite well on a class to class basis
do me a favor and stop making yourself look stupid the hyperion megathron and thorax are not long and narrow coulda fooled me of course theymega and hyperion are longer wider and taller than the rohkbut that makes the rohksmaller yet heavier and not an armor tanknot that that makes sense or anything but dont let that get in your way oh the shape of the object doesnt make a damn bit of difference as to how much inertia it has only the mass of the object but hey i only work in aerospace building some of the most sophisticated aircraft in the world i dont have a clue what i am talking aboutoh and i know about the mass thanks for making my point take your own advice then quit talking out your assnow if someone doesnt agree with your point of view you need to learn to accept it you have done nothing in this thread or the other to dispel virtually any concerns others have expressed that made any sense whatsoever badgering people to try and stop isnt going to convince them you are correct make an argument if they dont agree then dont repeat the argument and call them stupid too you got a lot of good comments over there but over here is where the rubber meets the road and your arguments are weak and so is your idea
i support this
wow red youre brain is so full of fail its astounding im sorry you seem to lack the educationintelligence to understand these concepts but here is a helpful hint for you dont confuse game lore with game facts any one that has been here for a decent amount of time would know first hand the caldari have always been slower and less agile then all the other races its been that way since beta and its that way now sorry but its the truth and youre assertion about the shape of mass not affecting moment of inertia is flabbergasting i am truly astounded some one would profess to understand these dynamics and then spew something like that since you seem so incompetent in this subject ill provide you some reading to educate your mind so next time you might be able to comment on this subject in an intelligent fashionmoment of inertiaon a side note signature radius is based in fact huh ok for arguments sake show me a link to any sensor anywhere in the world that measures sig radius any sensor that has ever been made or any sensor that is proposed for the future and i will relent my argument and publicly apologize you work in an aerospace building huh i guess it doesnt take much education to clean out the bathrooms
i support this idea
i really like this
thanks guys
rezaa the moment of inertia is based on a body rotating not the directional velocity of the bodyagain anyone who disagrees with you is now ignorant i never said that caldari ships were at any time in the game faster than minmatar but the lore says they are so my point is why would the game be completely different the the storys that are free to people joining the game we dont know but it would be far more interesting if they were the lore was written by ccp so that makes it an out of game fact oh and check your stats again almost every single caldari frigate is more agile than the other races frigates just for starters the stat is called inertia modifier i believenot in front of eve atm and less inertia means better agility so my point is shields weigh nothing and armor and structure weigh tons why do shield ships weigh more and go slower than armor ships its counter intuitive this has nothing to do with your vne proposal so why dont we agree to disagree and leave this part out of future discussionssignature radius is an all encompassing term for how well your detected so while your busy pulling you foot out of your mouth why dont you look infrared sensors motion detectors radar and ladar if you say signature radius has nothing to do with how these works then your wrong the easiest example is how can a person be detected by a home security motion sensor and yet a fly can zoom around happily without setting the sensor off well its because it cant detect the fly because its cross section or signature is too small sounds a hell of a lot like signature radius to me but dont let reality stop youagain you try and insult people to get your way then you question my education after you cant even understand the principles that apply to the link you posted and i fail
per you wiki link describing moment of inertia asit is the inertia of a rigid rotating body with respect to its rotationthis is used to determine the stresses imposed on rotating bodies this is how they figure out how to balance the tires on your car not the maximum tolerances of a body in straight and level flight air or no airbecause as has been pointed out by me and others there is in fact always airi dont want an apology just stop defending your idea like people who dont agree are ignorant you dont even have to say your wrong hell i even defended the basis of the idea in the other thread shortly after you posted it but here and there you attack people who dont agree and its not conducive to proving your idea is soundat a minimum you need to edit and clarify your original post in both threads and discuss how you would resolve lag issues i still dont think it would be resolved because your proposal is to simply never step on the gas yet thats what nets you the best acceleration right so by never stepping on the gas you never get up to speed as fast as possible and throttle back or you throttle up and hope lag doesnt kill you hence the lag problem not to mention the additional calculations the server would have to perform would amount to additional load for each ship so even more lag

voting againsta hac speed fit has no reppersat 27kms it will be shredded and a waste of 200mwhy are the recons even slower than the hacs they are a cruiser variant with less armor and less dps recons should be faster than the hacs not sloweryour post doesnt really make sense
recons are force multipliers there part of a number of tactics that when used in a specialised gang can ruin an organised rabble or whole well against a number of different tacticsspeed is another one combining this with strong ewar strong midlong ranged weapons or high damage at any range makes a ship too strong when a ship is capable of filling separate roles or niches well its generally considered as overpoweredas for hacs the main point is that they dont overlap with ships smaller than it with snakes boosters faction mwds and gang links this was too easy previously now however i merly want there base mwd speeds approach something more like 2735kms with rigs a speed increase in many cases so it wouldnt be a speed too different from whats found on tq

pattern smells like old socksalso 1 provided the warrior iis are about a half kms slower than proposed drone ships should have to fit a drone speed mod for the specific purpose of shredding inties but should be able to hit most anything else without
eehhh agreed more or less i think warrior stemming from minmatar design should be faster than other definitely fast enough to catch a slower cepter but not like an all t2 fit one so yeah agreed1

this is the second week that a pvp guild has declared war on our smallish mining corp severly hindering our enjoyment of the game and causing me to rethink why im paying 15 for sitting in some station waiting for the war to end so we dont have to worry about someone ganking our unarmed miners and haulerspvp is crippling eve and thats why its still so small i allways hear from devs about how suprised they are that the core systems are over crowded like they havent got a clue im sure someone is going to post if you cant stand the head leave or the other popular one get a combat ship and fight back well i dont want to leave there is no similar game on the market yet and i surly dont want to become a pvper too first off its not how i want to enjoy my time and second its feeding the very disease i want to get rid ofif ccp doesnt fix this soon there gonna be a ghost town when player friendly eve like games go live in a year or so sure they might limp along with 1020k hardcore pvp players but if you got shareholders your cheating them out of possibly millions in profits by keeping eve a pvp nitch game
hahaha ok you got me
what a dilema you dont want to play the game but you do want to play the gameme is confusedeve isnt a pvp niche game thousands of pilots happily live without combat each and every day in eve and enjoy the game learn to protect your assets or hire someone to return the favourmost small corps that get hassled go on to be big corps with teeth those not willing to adapt and change wither and diebtw if it was going to be a ghost town it would have happened 4 years ago and i dont remember ccp ever saying i would be able to mine in peace
guys how will we farm our isk now fix ur game ccp
if you dont like being at war feel free to retreat to a npc corp youll find them refreshingly free of nasty people wanting to pop your hulk
sukioyou are a troll which i think you are because you cleverly threw in the term guild or someone that has not been around long at all just fyi this is a pvp nonconsensual based game it has been that way since day one and playerstrolls like yourself has been spouting the  i am quitting and taking my 9000 alts and friends with me and then it grows year after year what you are asking and proposing would destroy eve and ccp would lose subs so fast it would make your head spin we would go from a peak of 40k a night back to where we were 4 or 5 years ago of 5 to 8k you see the growth stems from the fact this game is not like any other and it is for a certain player group that enjoys this type of gameif you do plan to leave contract your stuff to me kthx
added to the agenda for sunday 3rd
adding it to the agenda this sunday just to make sure it doesnt get forgotten if it passes well be able to get specific feedback and prioritize for the fix and future csms will have a record of our pushing on the issue
watching your war target get repped and not being able to shoot the guy makes me want to kick puppies  and i kinda like puppies even
voting support but i wouldnt necessarily remove dds just make them into some type of super laser 500000 raw damage 5 or 10 min refire rate tracking akin to a capital class weapon make it into some kind of anti capital weapon for referance a tanked carrier normally has over 1 million ehp while a tanked dread has twice that so this wont be one shotting anything
this guy should replace the lavista tard as csm
one idea i have heard for balancing the ddd apologies to whoever i stole this from was to make the damage pulsed keep the total damage the same as it is currently but apply it in bursts over a minute or so say 7500 damage every six secondsthis does three things one it allows smaller ships a chance to escape while taking only one or two blasts lag permitting two it gives titans more time to be caught  they have to stay on grid while the effect is ongoing three it could be set up so that only one doomsday could be active at a time removing the drop three titans on a fleet and kill everything subcapital instantly problemthere would still be the essential titan problem that the best way to keep your titan alive is to have another one and dd any hictors that are around but this would remove the by the time youve loaded grid and seen the titan your whole fleet is already dead feeling and to anyone who hasnt encountered that let me tell you its quite  and titans as defense against roaming gangs is only getting more common

needs extra customizeable stuff for interior when ambulation hits too
titans suck you are raoming around looking for a fight there is a nice gang chillin out on a gate in a system that would totally result in pew pew fc checks to see if they have a titan pilot logged in they do in that systemfc ok mates lets go somewhere elsei dont know why they did not forsee this its just not fun an happens all the time to every single 00 entity in the game i very much doubt any 00 pvper can say that they havent been in a situation where they avoided an otherwise good fight simply because one side had a titan presentthe suck if only for that reason we play the game for fun fights and titans prevent that
solar flares magnetic storms dust coulds and other oddities are not nearly as common nor as signifigant as star trek voyager would have you believe theres a reason they call it space you know
and theres a reason no one wrote in to star trek sayinggee you guys sure make outer space look active could you dress it all down a bit i mean im a nasa rocket scientist and i know for a fact that space doesnt have that much going on youre taking away from the immersion i crave from this otherwise obviously quite factual 24th century settingits a show and this is a game and games are for entertainment not for studies on how civilization will look 40000 years in the futureso get over yourself and accept the fact that some of us crave more spacey stuff more than we need added mechanics to killing each other
i cant think of a worse game time sink than taking down or putting up a pos tower with the high module count on larger alliance front line towers it can take 3 hours or more to put up or take one down can we get some use out of the skill most tower guys are forced to train to level 5 anchoring please consider allowing a 5 reduction in anchoring and unanchoring times on pos modules per anchoring skill levelcomment on this idea ready go
confirming that it is indeed a terrible time sink
i agree i put up one small pos once and ill never anchor anything again for long time
excellent idea
duplicate thread  see issue starbase logistics is needlessly souldestroying
yep
duh
sounds good to me
yes
great idea
that is definitely a must and hopefully should be easy to add correct me if im wrong but isnt the alliance chat channel lacking in that department as well

for the most part the courier system in its current state is broken requiring insane amounts of bond for the most trivial cargosto really make it function your going to have to use some game trickssince this is not real life game packages are too vulnerable as there is no security or penalties for theftyou must use game mechanics in a less complicated way and here is how you do itshippers buy cargo boxes by size 15101001000 m3 and postage based on distance risk and special handlingthese boxes are them placed on the postal market for anyone to haulthe trick is that the product doesnt actually exist in the box it only exists at either the origin or the destonation once the box is deliveredthis means for the most part the postal service is reliablesure a pirate can attack and destroy a hauler but all he can do is either collect the boxes and turn them in for the hauling fee or leave them in space till they rot and respawn at the origin this makes the system functonal and infinatly more people will use ityou can also have a bulk shiping service where a shiper has like 1 million ore to haul he sets up a similar postal contract distance risk special handling and that fee is devided up per m3 so that many ships can participate in hauling the cargo to the destonation only depending on the ability to haul part or all of the cargo but again the ore isnt actually hauled only a place holder for the ore or it could be zy or noc the hauler never knows and it doesnt make a difference he just hauls the cargo units even if he logs out the cargo tokens will reset after a period of time untill the order is canceled or the cargo completes the trip to the destonationsome people will say that its not realistic but i say its also not realistic that there is no real security or real penatlies to make transporting goods reliable enough for shipers so either they dont use it or they place huge bonds on trivial shipments which most are booby traps placed their by the shiper to kill haulers for bond farmingi could spend much of my game time contently hauling player cargos around the galaxy but right now thats not possiblepeople that can afford to drop millions for a bond arnt the ones that want to haul cargos
theres a serious flaw in your suggestion and thats having the boxes be empty until deliveryeve strives for realism when it comes to certain matters of course its a game and the setting is about 40000 years in the future but when it comes to ways of screwing each other over they try to keep it legitso theres no way that you would mail an empty box to family across the country and then have the actual contents magically appear upon delivery either they were in the box the whole time or someone just opened an empty boxthat being said i agree that the courier system needs several changes1 players setting outrageous collateral one possible fix would be allowing collateral to be automatically determined as the contract is made a fair market price similar to the amount figured into insurance could be assessed for all the items then your packaged bundle has a set amount which is stamped collateral2 even if collateral is left to the players the rewards are vastly out of scale players charging 500bil collateral and offering 350 isk reward after a 50 delivery while most would say dont take the contract i ask why was it allowed in the first place instead have the reward calculated based on the players assessed collateral as well as the distance traveled if a package is 20mil and needs to travel 10 jumps through lownull sec then the reward should be well worth the effort if the path is all high sec then it shouldnt be as much a reward given the lack of real risk3 a completely different alternative could be taking away player filled contracts entirely while it would make a lot of haulers mad as well as ruin some pirates fun when they try and lure you through their gate camps it would solve the problem when you buy something off market then a 10 fee is added this covers the shipping and handling for interbus to carry it from wherever it may be to where you are ordering from depending on distance it could take minutes to maybe an hour for delivery the best part of this approach is it defuses jita entirely no longer would you have to braveadd to the lag when you can get products no matter where they are stored at the timeagain just some ideas ive had about fixing courier contracts as well
my original reply got lost during a comms break while posting but basically this was part of the need for speed stuff as only the live ship is touchable  changeable by the pilot at any time cf
yes please i dont see how me spamming ships changes while waiting for the session change timer just to change names helps speed
i support this
we play this game because we love it as it is dont go removing the bits we enjoy ccp
get out
make me
im not sure who authorized you to speak for them but you dont represent me or my opinion
moderators please delete this useless thread
your in a noob corp nuff said
oh and yea i do represent a majority of eve considering there is 2 and a half times more votes against the nerf than for it
i support the idea behind this messagethe devs are there to solve problems we need devs to solve problems but not like thisthe nerf sledgehammer cant fix anythingdevs need to learn to use a nerf scalpel
redacted this forum needs less sullying and more reasoning
if you think the people who keep pwning you now are going to stop after the nanonerf you are gravely mistakenit has never been about overpowered ship just highly skilled experienced players killing the carebear noobs no amount of nerfing is going to make you a better player
overpowerd ships are the reason for the nerf cruiser sized ships that orbit fast enough to take no damage from their chosen targets by chosen targets i mean a large list of several classs of ships that were powerless to defend kill or even escape from them interceptor speeds and beyond with hac damage res and buffer yea not overpowerd at all lol
because 8heatsink geddons made the game more fun for people who werent sitting in the pilots seat
you completely fail to understand how pvp worksit goes like this lock target  scramble  web  shootyou just forgot the webi can assure you that if you web your fast orbiting target it will start taking damage and it will die if you have better tank and gankmost of the challange in fighting speed tactics is about getting them into web range either by making your web range longer by intercepting their orbits using other people with webs disabling their mwds with neuts all about the webit is pointless to talk about dealing damage before you get web
this
thats right you can gank certain stations and get garrented kills from those who attempt to undock this is a perfectly legal exploit of the game mechanics and ccp will no reimburse ship loses due to this weakness in game playhow does it work when you undock you get a count where you cannot redock at these stations you are also spat out at distance from the station so even if you did survive the first 30 seconds of combat you cannot redock anyway as you are now outside docking range sit outside the undocking point put a web and scram on any poor bastard undocking from these stations garrented killand unlike jump gates where you get 30 seconds of cloak to call for help as well as a random spawn point anywhere in space at 15kms from the gate stations spit you out in the same place everytime so there is no guess work involvedgood luck good hunting now go exploit the hell out of these stationsps please fix these stations urgently
theres a fairly substantial delay before you can target someone undocking align and warp already i much prefer the ability to force combat than the old method of someone undocking killing one member of a station camp dropping aggro and redocking
a i wish all stations were like this b its spelled guaranteed c no support
youre complaining about a tactic that has been in place for over 5 yarrs oh sorry years i sincerely doubt they the devs are going to do anything about this one and i am pretty certain that they shouldnt do anything about it even if they were inclined toi mean welcome to eve undocking can be a biatch eve can be a harsh cruel and unforgiving mistress suck it up get used to it grow a pair or get the f outbesides its not like there is nothing you can do about this by simply being a better less whinny player if this bothers you so much take steps in your own play style to minimize your risk ie go to stations that arent as exploitable as the ones you are using nowjust because you dont like an element of the game doesnt mean it should be changedno support
this is a nice feature to prevent undock gank tactics like some used to thrive on and it was made this way to decrease the undock problems with certain large stns like jita 44
not only that but it prevents the truly annoying undockredock teasing if you wanna play now you gotta go all the way no support whatsoever
me points and laughs no
i will say go all or nothing either every single station spits you out of dock range or non of them do its really annoying to pick hq sytems based on whether or not they have a kick out station
they should all spit you outside of redock range dont undock unless youre ready to die
then they should put some window holes into the stations so you can see outside of it before you undock  this is a really stupid idea 
press ctrl space as u undock and u slow down like before the patch
and then your immediately targetable doesnt help at all especially in lag
funny cuz if that were the case you wouldnt be hiding and station hugging all the time now would ya if i had a nickel for every time a sf member used the station to save themselves id be the richest in eve
this would be awesome
fairly obviously 5 to sensor strength per level you could have one skill or four depending on preference but that would be what the eccm skill would do just like signature analysis or longrange targeting
remove ecm problem solvedi havent looked at the stats but if signal dist amp boosts sensor range strength tracking and optimal they will be the ultimate sniper module sniper ships might free up 34 mids slots with using those
and replace it with whatdistort amps do not boost anything except ew strength im inferring from your comment that you dont really know much about ew you can start here
not supported by complicating mining you dont really make it more fun atm micromanaging cargo capacity is fun enoughalso about finding mercoxit in 01 or something like that really not supported its 00 ore go to 00 tho some really rare occasions are rather funny like crokite in 06
yes 
i know its a 00 ore hence why i said it would be an extremely rare find in exploration sites outside 00 im not talking about finding fields of best quality mercoxit in low sec maybe 1 basic quality low content asteroid in 10000 other asteroidsremember you may have found the asteroid but youre still going to need a ship fitted for mercoxit mining and the skills to extract it safely and nobodys going to be keeping a ship like that on standby for such a ridiculously rare find unless they happened to be a dedicated specialist miner with existing access to 00however once you find the asteroid field theres nothing stopping you from selling the location to someone who does have the ship and skills to mine that if you dont same as any other prospectorexplorer
op took the words right out of my mouth
i agree this post is now about boobies
strongly disagree

this one makes more sense did not read your topic

bait
anticeptor  baittankyou havent seen the old duramallers of old have you
been there seen them  however noone uses them nowsure you could say that because it gets some more armor however everyone would know about it if something this unique was implemented that extra armor is just some more buffer it still wont reach close to the ehp of your standard buffergankgeddeon you could as well as bait with a passivefit drake
a ship specifically to use an exploit lol
bumping isnt an exploit its perfectly im not so incredibly stupid  i can only f18 or play wow
its a t1 cruiser what do you expect why dont you use it for um yknow shooting things thats a proper role right therehave you compared it to the moa thorax and rupture seems roughly even to meoh man im gonna get flamed so hard for this post arent i
aww come one just look at the popularity of the ship in question its as popular as reinforced bulkheads did you even know that there ever was a module called reinforced bulkhead untill now
its basically just a laser boat with a reasonable tank like a scaled down apocalypse its bonus to laser cap usage implies to me at least that its intention was simple shooting its not elegant by any means but it works reasonably well on lower level 2 and 3 missionsi object that you would say i didnt know about reinforced bulkheads i did know about them i just chose to ignore them
you just explained it even better than me people did know about the maller they just choose to ignore it
pro the proposed changes on sisi seem over the topcon vote of no confidence in the management of the dev team at least as over the top as the changes on sisi wanders off looking for the thumbs down  option 
there used to be places to explore places that were not overrun by others where the sound of the solar wind is all that could be heardnow you cant swing a stick normally without hitting another playerand while i understand the fostering of a pvp enviroment i think you are taking it a bit farkinda strange we have exploration yet you are hardly ever more then 5 jumps from another playerwhere is the unknownwhere is the room for growthi am not saying make another region full of new stuff that has never been seen beforei am saying you could plant 100500 more systems with the same old stuff in them around the universe and we would be a better game for itas it stands now it feels like a giant ant farmhow about a little room to move there devs35k online is crowded no matter what you say 150 capital class ships moving from system to system means its crowded and we need something to shake it upnothing spectacularadd that new and unknown stuff on the fly and dont tell anyone you added itbut really it would make the universe so much more then the goldfish bowl it is becoming nowedit  and csm i remember one of you saying that ccp asked you to think bigguess whatadding 500 new system and not telling anyone what the hell is in there is just thatand it gives you a reason to actually have a mobile stationship thingyas it stands now you dont have a big enough bowl for the whale you are trying to get put in gameso you get something and the community gets somethingeveryone is happy
low sec used to be empty before fw ill give you that that may be crowded now but while the majority of 00 is claimed it is also mostly empty save for alliance hubs go there and explore wouldnt be opposed to more exploration sites thoughif youre argument is that you will get killed by the locals think what would happen if you added more systems there would be a rush of entities to claim the space while in theory the idea of empty space is refreshing you must realize that it will soon be filled up naturally by arbitrage
i would recommend a cataclysmic event that would wipe out everything say in a number of regions of 00 and watch the fireworks with the power vacuumthe natural world had a few ice ages maybe its time for new eden to have one
sure it would be called make a new server but thats against the entire philosophy of eve
a few regions is hardly a new server coming from a goon however i understand your fear of this thought i think you meant to saybut thats against the entire philosophy of goonswarm
i like the idea of exploring uncharted space it would open up a whole new branch of occupations in the game and it has been described in this thread in alot of detaillinkage
the eve population is heavily centered in a handful of systems leaving the great majority of them nearly empty
sorry for the misunderstanding new server was in reference to your cataclysmic event idea not to the addition to regionsi still stand by my original post that they wouldnt be empty for very long
honestly i cant see as how more star systems is ever a bad idea and just as frankly ccp has not let the number of star systems grow with the populace of the game at allin sharded games populace expansion can simply be handled by more shards but since sharding is against very basic concepts in eve the only other answer is to give an increasing player base more room to play in this ccp has simply failed to do and i think is one of the major reasons that you have seen the game populace decrease since the heady days of 50k records being broke on the server every couple of weeks after all when was the last time you saw another concurrent user record set its been a while hasnt it i support this topic and all of its ideas the only thing i would add is that youre missing a zero on the end of the number of systems i would like to see added yep my wish is for closer to 5000 by my guess this is what is needed at this point and to allow for a little future growth no i am not joking and yes i think this is very possible with ccps current resourcesone thing i will admit to is that i am and old exploration junkie from all the way back in beta i can fondly remember my old record set in early 2004 when i took a cruise through lowsec and nosec i went 54 jumps without repeating a single system and didnt see another soul in local the entire trip try that now daysi miss those days and fear they are gone forever but what the heck ill give the op a thumbs up anywaycheers
izthat is a great stance for pr but not at all practicalif 1 ship does too little damage you buff that 1 shipif 1 ship does too much damage you nerf that 1 shipthe alternative would be buff every ship except that 1 ship to bring them up to that s
agreed game mechanics should always be prioritized over ship buffsnerfshoweverwould you classify altering the roles of caps and supercaps as ship balance or a game mechanic change this is to anybody
lavistacsm can think of themselves as the first real house of representatives of eve the first real oog political organization that effects the whole of evecsm may have a lot of large issues at the moment just like any new nation has to deal withbut 
while we definately should not get bogged down by every nerf x and buff y threads there may be occasions where a specific ship really does need discussing we should be very careful about this but i wont simply refuse to look at shipmodule balance issues
i have noticed way too many threads popping up in here the last few weeks that really should be in features and ideasnot here
all the pirate frigs and cruisers need some love but especially my beloved dramiel and cynabal

disearves a nod support
this might be an interesting feature to implement in the future but there are more pressing immediate concerns than new featuresthe issue of massive lag in large fleet engagements has and still is being neglected in favor of making more and more shiny new toys for people to use to keep them playing and paying for the game instead of fixing the core issues that would ultimately make the game much more enjoyable
i specifically like this as an anticapital tactic for smaller ships though the server performance and ui issues are valid points raised someone mentioned having a subsystem targetter module combining this with scripts lowmidhigh slot script or maybe specific moduletypes scripts can determine what you will be targetting why a script because the eve ui is terrible and menus will be too unwieldy during combat
why what problem is this fixing
while i would love to see this as an ecm pilot it would be significantly overpowered ecm is quite powerful enough as it is
thats a dangerous stance to take coming from a point of view which would likely make you even more unpopular than we arethe point im making is this  in our three months weve received 19 declarations of war from mission runners and mercenaries alike with the change you are supporting there has already been an overwhelming number of players who said they would start actively salvaging if it gave them aggro which would increase the number of this activity tenfoldthis means there would be a rise in the number of mission runners who do not wish the change and an rise in the number of those looking to who was responsible not necessarily a place id be too quick to jump intoof course as i bill myself and my corporation as the best of the best when it comes to ninja salvaging perhaps that is a paradox in and of itselfi definitely respect the post as i do with anyone who posts with thought rather than emotion it takes a lot to post with thought instead of the canned no u responses we usually geti look at it from this point of view  theres loot and then theres salvage i believe the reason why theres two separate types of drops are because of the desire to keep the actions and aggro rules separate as well otherwise a jetcan would be full of a mix of items and salvage or the act of salvaging would drop salvage which was worth significantly morepersonally i lean towards the fact that ccp made salvage worth so little just to satiate a tiny niche and that theyre probably surprised at how popular this niche has becomein the end i respect your point of view however i believe that making the change would be disadvantageous to both sidesboth ninja salvagers and mission runners would need to adapt but in the end i believe that mission runners would be affected negatively to a greater extent thats where i believe the balance issue would cause greater irritation
oh im quite used to that i should probably call it a lifestylethat is one possible outcome but i dont think so the reason i dont think so is that the aggro is already there if you want it just pick up some missiles or some ammo or whatever when salvaging dotard has mentioned in a number of threads that he does exactly this on purpose which i happen to think is cool actuallybecause the option is already there and simplicity itself to enact i doubt the change would would create much difference in participation levelsi could of course be entirely wrong people are weird things but the logic does flow that if the option is there and not being used then making that option automatic wont entice folks who werent bothering to use it anywayid not be alone and ive had worse to be honest not something im worried at all aboutoh i get emotional sometimes too but i prefer rational discourse no one who knows me will question that i have a temper there are times particularly on the internet however when some discussions become not worth the time or effort any longer i dont like those thank you for being civil im totally cool with agreeing to disagree  thats a good thing but it should be done with rationality and respecti expect youre right although i think it has more to do with a number of other balancing factors entirely apparently at one point mission loot and pay was much higher but was lowered salvage does not seem to have been and that perhaps is the issue i wouldnt be bothered by the concept of ninja salvage were the salvage not such a high percentage of the actual take in a pair of l1s i recently ran to build up standings i couldnt get a better agent despite the t2 vs l1 overkill the salvage value was 14 times the combined loot value and mission pay honestly i did the math fourteen times now its nothing like that good for l4s but still one can see where one might think that a bit broken that the cheapo stuff is protected but the really good crap is up for grabsnod i understand i suspect that i feel that the negative impact you predict i would see as positive i have mostly given up mission running im good at it in fact very good at it given my low level of sps but its boring a little aggro would spice it up
thats one of the reasons i hired him that and the fact that he has an outpouring of personality which is sometimes hard to find onlineill give you that mission running is boring i tried it and havent gotten past the first level due to the fact that i quit to pursue other endeavours as id mentioned here or in another very similar thread if i wanted to play against the computer i probably wouldnt be playing eve theres a lot in eve that has to be improved for me to ever want to play against the machine and not want to play against the person
i support this thread and there needs to be a serious discussion on the topic replies like the one above are what got this idea thrown out with no real thought offerednobody is asking for a ship that can locate and run a 1010 solo what we are asking for is the ability to explore out a site and then complete at least the moderately difficult ones its ridiculous to go 15 jumps finally find a site and then have to track back 15 jumps get my ship jump back 15 jumps run the site go back 15 jumps get my covops and start again its not being lazy anymore than having jump capable ships makes those players lazy and no im not asking for the exploration ship to be jump capable just making a time waste comparison
ill admit im not too knowledgeable on the topic so my question is  why are marauders currently unable to perform this task is it the lack of bonuses cpugrid to fit scanners from what i see you can fit scan probe launcher full rack of weapons and a decent tank on all of these
scan time is part of it a ship without the bonus means fewer scans per probe which means many more probes in the cargo hold also im trying to eft a golem and im having a lot of cpu problems with the launcher at least one hacking or analyzer and any kind of reasonable fittinganother popular ship currently is the pilgrim though that too is about as awkward as a middle school dancein essence this is sort of like the days when people mined with battleships yes it worked it could have been left like that even though it always felt wrong thankfully we got barges and then exhumerssame principle here yeah we can get by either ganging up or making a lot of jumps back and forth but its a ship role begging for a dedicated class i know that exploring isnt the most popular area of the game but it is really fun for the few who pour ourselves into it and i felt more than a little slighted by how casually our concerns were dismissed as being lazy
agreedlooking at the other things to do in eve mining for example does also require to move several ships somewhere but you havnt emptied a new system for asteroids in a couple of hours like when an exploration guy finds a useless site and will have to move on the difficuly of getting to a site is challenging enough allready  youll have to find a site and scan it down b4 you can get to it others might beat you to it and the site doesnt even have to be that interesting you can have scanned for hours finding nothing of interest the moving of additional ships is just ruining the fun
has anyone noticed that the answer to many things in eve is get an alt accounthonestly if it takes two subscriptions to play the game right then eve is more broke then i thought
interesting how a suggestion of exploring with a combatready partner is taken as an accusation of being lazymy point is that exploration especially for the moderate to difficult sites is ideally suited to two players working togetherthere are ships currently available to use if you want to solo the easy and moderate sites you do have to wait a little longer for the probes to scan and so it takes longer to track down the siteswith that said i fail to see your point there already are exploration ships and combat ships that can be used for exploration you choose to either solo and ship swap or solo and wait a little longer to track down sites or you do it with a partnerinvaribly i expect players want the ability to cloak and warpscan quickly to track down sites and then take care of rats and collect the loot at the sitenoone said it should be easy to earn a livingthere are plenty of other games where it isarithron
maybe im just not understanding youre position so can you help me here when you say you run with a combat ready partner what does he do for the hours you spend scanning down the site you at least are running the probes and the scans but i cant see anything he has to do does he wander off and rat how do you manage that in low security space or do you operate deep in some alliances territory let me restart with some premises because i think that will help this discussionpremise1 solo exploration should be a viable profession2 current ships and setups are wildly inefficient for low sec and 00 solo exploration3 a dedicated ship class for exploration wouldnt be any more unbalancing than a dedicated ship class for mining wasconclusion1 there exists a niche for a dedicated exploration vessel one which currently is not adequately filledalso nobody is saying it should be easy the only difference between current mechanics and what this proposal asks for is that you wont have to be jumping around all the time and swapping ships so unless you consider timesinks hard or the act of swapping ships hard and not just really really annoying then i fail to see your point with the easy living argument sounds like a straw man to me
my partner when i am scanning hunts rats in the belts of the system we are in and surrounding systems since i run a covert ops cloaker and he doesnt its good for him to move aboutgive me an idea how many players you think explore as a profession i suspect they do it along with mission running ratting etc i cant see the justification for the timediscussion for the csm when they are supposed to be dealing with larger issues that affect the majority of eve playersa ship that you are proposing would not just be exploration specific it would quickly start to be used for many other roles especially given its combat capabilities and cloakingby all means post your ideas in the ideas and features forum that is provided for future possible implementationsarithron
well i can see the justification for the timediscussion so i guess were evenand what larger issues should they instead deal with looking over their agendas i see a few major issues thats good but i see an awful lot of small issues too further they should at least have a real discussion on the issue when this first came up it was brushed off with a lol u noobs r teh laziest if they came up with a real discussion and consequently decided not to forward the issue or to remand it to the ideas and forums section so be it but to blow off the idea with no real discussion that is a problem with them not seeing a style of game play and is a real issue of concernfurther since i dont believe they will be inclined to discuss anything that doesnt involve direct pvp why dont we discuss it for them what exactly is your problem with a ship of this type ive laid out an area this ship could fill nicely now id like to hear exactly why you think this type of ship would be a bad idea properly balanced is there any combat ship this would replace do you fear it would take the place of recons ok make it only a scan probe time bonus battlecruisershacs those ships are combat orientated so as long as this ship doesnt do the damage they do it should be ok black ops ships does anybody actually fly theseim just curious you seem very against this idea and against it receiving any fair discussion and id like to know why thanks
we are having fair discussion id be happy for exploration to be shown more love but i dont think that you could have a balanced exploration ship that is any better than the ones currently used for explorationill make a quick list of needs for an exploration ship firstly1 an exploration ship would require the ability to cloak and stay cloaked whilst moving since youd be exploring low sec systems etc thus youd need a ship with the ability to fit covert ops cloakers ideally2 the ship would also need to be able to carry scan probes fit a launcher and then still have room for the loot from site ratscontainers etc thusa decent sized cargo hold3 youd need some bonus to scan times although admittedly you could make players do this via skills and rigs therefore youd need some good rig space4 the ship would need to do pretty good dps to deal with site rats and the ability to soak damage since youd be wanting race specific ships  then some would have high sheilds others high armour or the low and mid slots plus cpugridcap available to fit modules5 since some explorers would prefer to keep slots free for the various bits and pieces every good explorer needs a drone bay might be in orderthese would be just the basic requirements as i see it id imagine youd need at least 57 high slots given that some would be occupied with probe launcher etc this would allow you to dish out a decent amount of dps if flying solo youd need a few mid and low slots alsonow given all this we have a ship that is pretty good at combat and can cloak and warp on top of that it has a decent cargo bay and maybe a drone bay plus can probe things out pretty fast can you see this ship be utilised elsewhere i certainly can and i dont believe you can balance it so that it is good for exploration alonecurrently the only real thing that prevents explorers using a raft of combat ships for exploration is the fact that the covert ops cloaker cant be fitted to them this is the decision you make  scan relatively safely but require a ship swap or partner or  scan a little more in the open and take longer doing it but be able to collect on sites once probed outi think this is fair to other players who dont explore and earn iskies in other ways for instance miners dont have the luxury of cloaking and have to accept the risks when mining low sec and have to haul their ore akin to ship swappingi just dont think you can have your cake and eat it too remember i also explore and dont think explorers are lazy i just see a bigger picture outside exploration arithron
yeah we are having a good discussion i just wish the csm had done the samenow i have an idea and not to derail our thread too much but what about this to solve our problem make it a true science vessel so it wont be able to run combat plexes but it could still warp cloaked and fit analyzerscode breakersgas harvesters give it a good tank id suggest making it a soe faction ship but thats just me probably shields but whatever but now here is the change make it so that it can hackanalyze cans that still have rats guarding themgive it three highs a cloak a probulator and a salvageranyway im no ship balance specialist but i think something workable could be created in this field mostly i would have liked the csm to at least examine the issue and maybe make the suggestion that ccp look into its creation for this particular play style i firmly believe that with the right parameters such a ship could be created that isnt unbalancing to the game and would fulfill a valuable and needed rolethis issue deserves a second look
well there could be an arguement for making the tools that explorers use able to be used when cloaked eg analysers this would circumvent the need for an exploration ship altogetherhowever is this giving one set of players a large advantage over others who earn their iskies in other ways arithron
maybe but i dont think its any bigger than what marauders did for people who mission over people who mission in ravensagain though id like to go back to the root of the issueif you and i were not in charge of balancing this ship if we left the design of bonuses and abilities up to ccp is there a need for this shipi still contend that bonused and balanced by the experts this ship would fulfill a valuable role in the eve universe let me put it another way if we could mix and match ship parts my character would have already chop shopped a couple ships and made a dedicated exploratory vesselalso not to nerd too far out on you but what would starfleet look like without science vessels babylon 5 without their explorer vessels starcraft without the science vessel god the first time i saw that exploratory vessel on bab5 i wanted to fly onethis is the only mmo on the market where exploration means anything where going to places that dont just appear on an overview or map saying go here for golditemsminerals means you get something special where it actually does take skill to make discoveries that is a unique and wonderful feature of this game one that has gotten me to come back time and again when other games scripted content got too predictablei understand the soldiers of the universe have little use for scientists  explorers but we would like to participate in the universe too

function at a losshaha my friend i know not everyone understands the economics of such things but being familiar with the economics of running a development studio and specifically how an recurring charge implementation pans out in dollars and cents your post is very funnyccp is in no way shape or form hurting on eve online based on time involved to create the original product times average number of coders to do it in that time times the average going rate for a game developer eve would have broken even for say the first year and made approximately 60 profit every month since then if they are true efficiency experts it could be closer to 80 but its well above 50 unless they are truly bad at the business side of things granted some studios arewhat is happening here is simple some analystbean counter has told them enough times that they can get more per month and get away with it its that simple why sell it at 15mo when you can charge 20 the answer in morals is because its wrong to charge 20 when you are doing well off at 15 the answer in businessnot a rule but often times is do it there is a reason why no software developer of any quality has stayed on top for long eventually they become too disconnected from their users and make their one big mistake because of thatwelcome to ccps one big mistake
honestly i dont think its a mistake for people paying for the game with real money its still 15 a month you can buy a month then suspend payment essentially buying a 30 day codefor people who buy their codes using isk those prices will change a little but ccp doesnt care too much bc its space currencythe people who are hit hardest here are those who sell codes for isk they are forced to make larger purchases at once and dont get as good a deal this probably hurts rmt as well imo this is a good thing
well as for gtcs look in the forums for it moneyisk ratio isnt being hurt at the moment in fact the gtc dealer is actually making abit more atm40 90 day was going for about 350m isknow 35 60 day is going for about 350m iskto make it clear my point was this this is a preface to raising the monthly fee which is where my issue lies 15 is a premium price already for what is being delivered but it is acceptable when you start to raise that price it becomes too much in your favor and too little in mine it loses its value if the monthly rate is not being raised i have no problem 15 a month is the proper value and thats what its about what is something worth i am not one of those peoplethere are too many of them screwing it up for all of the rest of us who will pay whatever something costs if they really want it no for me the price has to make sense and in cases where i am aware of the cost of making such a thing the amount of profit made off my purchase needs to make sense it is relatively easy to look at what it takes to make something and come to a reasonable idea of how much it cost to make it from there you can reason out a reasonable pricei hope that clears up my beef in the previous post hence my references of 15mo becoming 20 because the increase in gtc pricetime ratio leads you in the reasonable direction that the monthly subscription price increase is coming next
afs need no ewar capabilities this not the rule of this class its better to give them more offensive capabilities like agility and speed
i have found that my ishkur can solo the l3s i normally fly in my myrmidoni have not had this level of success with a t1 cruiser other than a very specialized rangetank drone boatsniper ship and they can be hard to useat least in pve and fitted correctly they are functionally equivalent to a battlecruiser and are cheaper although their insurance is horrible and they require significantly more skills to flypvp is probably another animal entirely though
they are probably more interested in discussing game issues than discussing how one could marginally improve the efficiency of discussing game issues
you can find it in my original csm thread
the third right of players participating in the eve communityinfluence on how society is legislatedfinally individuals have the right to influence how society is legislated until now this right has not been fully accessible the goal of ccp is to provide eve s individuals with societal governance rights in similar fashion to a realworld democracy models candidates will be selected by fellow peers to be the voice of their interests to the legislator once elected the responsibility of these representatives will be to uphold the societys views as best they can via direct contact and dialogue with ccp central to this concept is the idea that increasing the utility of eve s society will encourage more individuals to join itsay that the next time ccp tells you that you to worry about bigger things the csm is to address our concerns and if a large chunk of players want a fix the color of the sun in jita then thats what we want and ccp can either tell us why they wont do it or make the change but lashing out at the community and the csm is the equivalent of cutting your wings off when your trying to learn to flyvoter communication with the csma dedicated electronic forum will be provided for voters to formally present issues to csm r epresentatives because this is a gathering place where topics deemed important to society are heard and acted upon by democratically elected representatives moderators must be present to keep discussions civilized ordered relevant and lawful1 these measures are necessary here as they are in real society to keep the unruly from disrupting any civil institution ranging from courts of law to the halls of legislative government bodiesagain the csmpdf doesnt define what we as a society and you as a representative cant do only that you are to listen and act upon topics deemed important by the societyi by no means agree with all the topics but ship balancing is just as valid of a concern as anything else if ccp doesnt like our concerns then they can disband the csm and raise a big white flag saying we dont give two s about what this community thinksas far as i am concerned the csm is working as intended aside from the clashing of eegos that goes on at timesmy growing concern is with the idea being pushed that the csm is supposed to be responsible for developing a vision for the future of eve i see nothing in the csm documentation that says the csm is an integral part of the eve development team and as such is responsible for developing the future of eve i would really like some clarification on this issue and if the csm that keeps pushing this fails to accept a role as a representative instead of a visionary then i am going to be posting support for removing that csm from office for failure to understand and fulfill the roles and duties of an elected representative
focusing on the vocal minorities individual pet desires for changes to their favorite ships is a distraction and is stupid it doesnt matter how many words you wrap around it youre more than welcome to discuss items but i have and will continue to vote and argue against any single ship buffnerf that is presented to the council unless someone can convince me theres a damn good reason were wasting our time on iti get it some of you think your voices arent being heard thats what the guy who thinks his ship should be better would say he would be wrong though his voice was heard his idea was just not in line with what should be the priorities if you want your ship buff voted on get support for it and it cant be ignored simple as that weve actually been direction to try and deal with grander issues well at least had it requested as we can certainly ignore that i however agree and stated so before i was elected ill be looking forward to your post explaining how im not fulfilling my duties and demanding my removal

i quite agree that the small crap that has been around for ages is something that niggles a lot of us and should be brought up initially but it is my hope that the amount of stuff in that area will rapidly reduce over time iz
no problem at all with submitting all the ship balancing issues in a general response only category the main reason for these topics was to flag up an issue for the devs to look at and i agree there isnt a huge need to debate each individual balance issue in formal csmccp meeting time as for why i havent replied publicly before this lavista im pretty sure we did come to a consensus to do this at one of the previous meetings anyway agreed
what if tracking disruptors also had some effect on ships that launched missiles or drones say tds make it harder for the parent ship to accurately relay the targets exact location to its drones and missiles perhaps the optimal disruption script causes a reduction in dronemissile velocity while the tracking script gives a larger missile explosion radius and drone signature resolution

god i hope this happends
didnt read all the specifics but its a simple yet good idea
what this brilliant man has said
and of course i agree as well
adapt or die you tards
while i support a nerf of polycarbs snakes and a stacking penalty on all speed mods i oppose everything else being implemented if some minor tweaks dont solve the problem revisit it a couple months down the road

i say the nano nerf should not happpen its only planned because people complain about how nano ships are overpowered after all that is bull they are not overpowered people just cant adapt to how people fit their ships ok  if you spend a billion isk on faction fitting of a nano ship and all your skills are maxed to 5 and you have a gang with perfect nano bonuses then you are nearly untouchable but i think in that case you deserve to live anyways webs exist in the game for a reason this also means the web nerf would not work the nerf needs to be revisedsigned
this get to it people give the devs in game examples of why all of these changes are a bad thing or they are going to blatently ignore popular demand like always i for one am doing my part have you done yours gentle reader
against the nerfi was right once they did the testing on sisi they needed to nerf missiles again cus people whined and probably going to look at ecm and neuts again when is it going to stop oh no i died pls make pvp damage 15 of pve damage like wowenough is enough
think before you act ccp nerfing nano should be done extremely carefully one thing at a time your proposing to much to fast as many ppl have said already do one or 2 changes see how it goes and proceed from there and seriously 5 hours 5 whole hours you thought about this and you release that blog dont they see the rammifications of even the slightest nerf to nano pull your heads out of your asses and look around  im not even against a nano nerf having bss fly around at 45kms is ludicurous but you need not destroy nanoing as a tactic because some people have found a loophole in a system you designed your system needs some fine tunning maybe having mass reduction work on an exponential scale meaning the heavier the ship is it is exponentially harder to make is go faster by reducing its mass thats just my opinion
quite possibly the worst set of proposed changes i have ever seen from ccp
no nerf

as much as i support this topic ccp will just do whatever they want so it is really not that worth while
definitively against
justdont
just to annoy my corp members i really dont want to go back to bs being the only cost effective ships to pvp in again but i can i guessedit and if the changes are reverted i say keep the scram changes to effect mwd just for more strategy and give gal recons a bit of a side boost
until i see some credible evidence that guerilla warfare remains viable i vote against this nerf right now it looks like the only viable option is to bring a bigger blob if you want to take on an established 00 alliance in their own territory anything else is simply going to die to the blob that gets jumpbridged in behind them after a few minutes of roaming by all means rebalance polycarbons and snakes but the changes currently on sisi will just push eve further towards being all about big fat boring laggedout blobs
support for this i like killing paper tigers

i have died to many nanos in the past but i respected them like hell everytime
after 2 years in eve and not a nanoer im finally ready to stop subscribing for anymore pointless training
interested to hear your experience on thisin the tests i have been invloved with the nanogangs could still pretty much disengage with impunity if they so wished but had less of an advantage if they decided to engagei think there is still some room for tweaking things but actually things seem to mesh together better than you would think from reading the devblog
this is the single best idea that ive ever heard the dual training mode is also a good idea as long as you can choose to train your skills this way and choose not to when you feel like it these changes would realy upgrade the games quality
yup i agree the dual train allows you to train a skill and another skill both at half time calculate when it will end no big deal if it ends when you cannot log in as the next skill will simply take over this will work best with long skills but the dual train i foresee falls short for short skills if you are going to work for 8 hours and set 2 skills that while in dual mode only take 3 hours the one being a normal 15hours then the other when the 15 is done only takes 2 hours after that but then again just pick a longer skill i guarantee you have skills that need upping to 5 if you are that new and i have skills that will take days right now ponly other option i see is the 2 skill queue but there might need to be some sort of way to stop stacking the 2 skills one idea is forcing the second skill to complete before you can set up another skill set of 2 to train and queue but then idk youd still have to worry about being on when the second one got done training p just a theorysuggestion with flaws d
most folks are cheesed off at the draftsman line but im one of the sods who grabbed a full set of consul implants lets fix em all
i am 5050 with this idea 50 for i am for this idea in the stopping research point gain as yes it is farming isk in a way as it is gaining isk from no work in game just like the macro miners we all know and hate so this would be a good thing to stop as the account is deactivated however50 againsti am against not allowing the player to finish a skill training while ofline as it is a single skill that is training and as soon as tht is over it does stop and no more training is done it is not gaining any isk in game and only affecting one particuler area of the game of witch that skill is relevent for unlike rp witch is giving an overall gain in the money dept
im generally against this idea the main reason i oppose it is because at several points i had to take extended leaves from eve to deal with rl situations  moving overseas for instance i did happen to train caldari battleship v in that time and it frankly made me quite tickled to come back and find a skill trained that i likely would not have bothered to train had i kept playing throughout that period its a positive that added to my enjoyment of the game and in no way was detrimental to anothers enjoyment of the game in other mmos which largely require xp grinds of various sorts taking several months off generally pushes you significantly behind your friends guildies etc it is precisely because this is not the case in eve that i have ended up paying for more months on my subscription that i have in any other mmo aside perhaps from eq1
one account expired thursday 2 more to go ccp please fix this mistake asap
ive read the dev blog and although im not entirely for all of whats said there i like the most of the stuff mentioned i dont like the idea of mwds being added a reactivation delay for example heres the main reason im for the nano nerfthe easiest way for a new player to accumulate a reasonable amount of isk is to do agent missions from my rich experience in that area i can tell that even the hardest of lvl4 missions can be completed relatively easy with your ship tanked properly and with little or no movement at all i can finish any lvl4 mission alone in my raven with this tactics im not saying that this is what should be mainly used in pvp and that the players with no pvp experience shouldnt adapt im just saying give these players a chance to adapt by at least balancing the ships speeds and youll see much more fights out there after all ship classes should regain their meaning

go nanonerf
swiss army knife do everything ships are the result of the nano plagueeach ship should have a role of its own t1 t2 and all sizes classes and should be able to do that role well and effectivelythe speed balancing enactment is a good step in the right direction
i have to vote for this change it balances the ships in relation to eachother and makes it meaningful to fly small ships again it also makes fighting inside web range possible

as much as id really love for this to happen i think this should wait a while before this is put inalso why the hell is this consider an issue its more an suggestion than anything
1 this is an issue because it has been years since ccp talked about adding this in and since then theyve only added new pirate kill each other in the face patches instead of actual spacey stuff for their deep space setting2 wait a while how much longer again years since they suggested itfor those who say take these discussions to features and ideas realize that everyone knows fi is a joke nothing in there is ever taken seriously and ccp has obviously formed that whole forum as a place for players to gripe and btch and then get over itif comments suggestions and complaints are at least being heard and acknowledged here in assembly hall then thats where people will go to voice themselves when ccp acts like they give two s about their customers then maybe the other forums will go back to serving a purpose
agree 200 with your commentswaiting is not months but years four to be correct so if thats not an issue  monsieur ittigerclawik must be a developper of some kindfeatures and ideas is indeed a joke  the drawingboard  hasnt been touched for yearsin development section is as outdated as it can get  the forum of features and ideas is full of good ideas but nothing is done with it  and then im not talking about stuff that is already in the game and could be improved here and there  im talking about stuff that is not there yet anyway we can get the forums full with suggestions and more but it wont change a thing
im currently in a small mining and hauling corp and for the last 2 weeks we have been wardec this is severly crippling our enjoyment of eve as it forces people to risk expensive unarmed miners and haulers to these pvp gankers that want easy kills or for just the pleasure of ruining our funthis is intolerable and people have been leaving the corp or effectivly logging for a week after throwing on a long skill or simply canceling their account that they are unable to enjoysomething must be done
think at thisyou pay millions of isk for mercenary protections and your enemies strike you when mercenaries are not online or anyway you are forced to play in group with online time of mercenary you hire if those mercenary are anyway incredible good they cannot pursuit alt pirates and similar so your war will continue forever and even you will upset even more the attackers that will maintain the war forever to ruin your funnow think at thisyou hire a mercenary corp and pay them millions of isk they locate enemy command center and force your attackers to come out form the hole and fight back or get totally destroyed if your attackers win they can continue to grief you and you have spent millions of isk for nothing if mercenary win read my post above aslo you can even help the mercenary out by travelling in every system trying to locate the command center for give the location to the mercenaryi think the only problem with this system is that griefers will be not happies cause they love only easy targets that cannot retaliate
the command center idea is epic im thinking transform the titan into this command center  therfore putting a limit on how those beasts are used in a corporationedits of course there would be pilots put off they wouldnt be able to use their trained skills so maybe thisonly one titan per corporation can be in command center mode and only that titan can fitfire its ddd as a defensive measure the other titan pilots get extra fit slotsweapon bonuses at ccps descretion but they cannot fit a ddd super dreads if you will

signedi fully endorse this suggestion
had a very cool ideato extend the place of small ships in a universe without local make scanner accuracy dependent upon sig radiusin a system that would be hit or miss while trying to jump on top of enemy forces small ships would have the advantagesay there was something like jump resolution that allowed your warp drive to lock onto ships on scanner with a certain level of accuracybig ships are for getting the job done small ships are for opening closing and finding doors

computers that are advanced enough to plot courses through thousands of solar systems per day should certainly be able to avoid a preset listin fact one option that ive been asking for in eve since day one is an avoid list i want to be able to mark certain system as avoid jita comes readily to mind the computer would only plot a course through that system if no other alternative within a preset amount of jumps could be foundthe interface would look a bit like thisavoid  system not to exceed  jumps
pffft need more risk than that
in other words you didnt actually read or understand my posts in this thread but just come with silly accusations instead of trying to argue against my points
lolguess you suck at trading or somethingyou can make chunks of cash trading with just 1 bil in capital and to get the kind of money outclassing 00 ratting you need at least that invested in your mission ship as well and unless you have no idea what you are doing trade is totally risk free as well whenever i bother with trading i make way more iskies for way less effort than with missions the only problem is that trading quickly bores me while missions are still kinda fun
simple example of riskless trading put buy orders in high sec for common module drops at 20 less than mineral buy orders value for the minerals components move them to a hub where you have 100 refining sell the minerals you get a 20 return spending half hour hauling every few days
this whole speed nerf thing has me on my toes for some 2 weeks now however i as many others directly and negatively affected by it do believe that something has to be done about speed this very thought has made me wonder why does eves pvp or shipvship or gangvgand or fleetvfleet system need a rebalance check since it is indeed one of the most straightforward and balanced pvp systems out there being analytical by nature i went to the beginning albeit how did the original designers came up with ship stats and bonii and it dawned on me its really really simple when the ships were designed bonii and penalties were incorporated to each ship while imagining its role and performance in a fleet comprised of the same factions ships honestly its that simple lets take a look at the individual casesthis is just the impression i got when going over the ships details when trying to decide which race to choose and what to train for bear with me and dont laugh i am not saying i am completely right but i know i am not completely wrong

so from my point of view everything is perfectly balanced this far however pvp is unbalanced to an extent why is that  well you do understand that players will gravitate towards the best solution so what you get is the uber fleetevery ship that gets picked is the absolute best for its role this is not bad in itself however it does negate the inherent penalties that ship has according to its race their is no reason to fear the uber tackler when the other gangs dps machine is not that strong but when your opponent does pick the uber tackler from one race and the uber dps from another combining their bonii and enhancing them with the bonii from a command ship from yet another race you have only one option to do the sameso we get gangs that consistently comprise of crows rapiers vagabondszealots apocs and falcons thats why you get fleets that comprise of sniper bs and a small antisupport screen thats why you need a fleet of 150 people just to have a prayer against anythingand thats it any attempt to rebalance stuff by nerfing a ship or a module or even across the board speed will fail against this setup people will just pick the most unaffected  benefited ships from the balancing change and you will end up with the same mundane ship choices and near exploit fitouts like the venerable nanophoon or nanomachwhats the solution  if you are foaming at the mouth from hearing all this hang on tight this will make you even angrier flame me but hear me out
make players form gangs of ships that belong to the same factionif you didnt get that aneurism yet heres how to do it give gangs and fleets that are comprised of ships of only one faction game breaking automatic bonuses relevant to their respective races command ship bonus you heard me right game breaking why  because only then will people gravitate towards using ships of the same race and effectively not only get their bonii but also their inherent penalties a gang of minmatar ships will have their ubervagas and uberrapiers but also have their crappy tempests and silly maelstroms for bswhat i mean by game breaking  lets see since i am minmatar lets say that a minmatar fleet will automatically get a 25 increase in base speed for every ship in the gang a 25 reduction of sig radius and a 25 increase in their web scrambling and disrupting bonus thats on top of the bonus they might get by a command ship minmatar of course that might be in the gang game breaking  for sure it would be so much game breaking that people might actually find it worthy to use the scimitar for logistics in the gang making use of the tracking link bonus and also use the dont laugh target painters to give their bs some extra dps to actually kill somethingand what is to stop that uber gang  but of course your game breaking bonused amar or caldari gang  an amar gang that can suck up all the damage of the afformentioned minamatar gang and instapop any ship that might get in their sights or the gallente gang that will negate all damage by shortening the range of minmatar weapons and chewing them up with drones until they finaly get them one by one in their webs or the caldari uber gang that will chew everyone but the smaller fastest ships from afar with their missilesget my point  every race can actually battle every other race on an even field well with minor tweaks that must be made but minor sensor damps for example they need to get unnerfed missile velocity and explosion velocity sure double it cause missiles would be used in a caldari fleet that has other balancing penaltiesand that is exactly my second point speed is overpowered because due to mixed fleets everyone benefits from it  thats how you get nanotars nanozealots and nanomachs sensor dams were overpowered because everyone used them but if you give minmatar ships the option to use something else then they wouldnt use sensor damps and there wouldnt be the need to nerf them effectively destroying the ewar of the gallenteaforementioned examples are rather random and may not work exactly as depicted by me but i am sure you will find similar situations based on your own experiencesedit alternate proposal and maybe more balanced system in post 53 page 2 of this thread
so how would this be implemented i dont think it would be too hard to do code wisely it would be rather tought to decide to on the bonii each faction fleet would get and how much of each but i think it can be done rather painlessly with a months playtesting in sisi with the help of the player base number crunching relative rebalancing all can be done with no code alterations its even roleplaying viable by say adding an iherent link in all ships of the same faction that would make them cooperate and share resourcescapitals i have not thought about because i have no hands on experience i generaly dont understand how they work and they have very specific use but i envision greatness if proper effort is put into themhow actual gameplay would be affected  there would be whine but nothing game breaking especially if the changes are outlined 6 months or more before coming into effect that would give everyone enough time to make their skill plans accordingly yes it might mess them for a few months come on you only need to do cruiser v for every race weapons are easy but again with proper warning it would just make for infinately better gameplay in the long runmissioners are unaffected or positively affectedsolo pvpers would not be affected except when against factiongangs but hey they would be toast against any gang if flying aloneolder players are mostly crosstrained when their corp or alliance decide to fly minmatar fleets or caldari fleets they are bound to be able to fly a couple of ship classes in each it might even turn more people to crosstraining every faction so that we wouldnt get so many bored capital pilots capitalonline anyone alliances have players of all races of all skills so they would be able to make up fleets of anything they wished imagine the ramifications of being able to use a gallente fleet to invade an amar fleet to defend a minmatar fleet to harass and recon and a caldari fleet to ehm defend a pos  gate maybe  and its easy for pvp alliances to issue orders on prerequisits on flyable ship for their members during the prepatch periodthe most affected would be small corps with relatively low skilled players they would have to totaly cooperate to get their skills together it can be done and since their not that deep into the game it will be easy cough for them to decide on a common course over the next 6 monthsfrankly i can see no disadvantage in altering eve gameplay to this granted its radical its game changingbut i am playing full time for the past 18 months and i can see only good coming from this you make smaller fleets stronger and maybe avoid blobs you give roleplaying a great boost you make people work together while limiting their freedom just by a bit you effectively enforce factional warfare on all eve without making up an artificial environment for it it will still be rock  paper  scissor but on a team basis not on a iwin ship classso that is my mega wall of text bash me all you want i am very interested to see how you see this
i see what your saying and i have to agreebut i would like to point out that it is kind of like this alreadyin my corporation we have at least 80 gallente people so generally when i fc corp ops we end up gallente ships its really nice when this happens you dont have to worry about ships preforming in different ways and you dont have to worry about having to employ different tactics with different ships basicaly put its an advantage and although a bonus would be cool im not sure i agree with all the details good idea anyway
i would like to see 00 sovereignty changed as it is currently boring and except for fights at prearranged times discourages pvp the change i would like to see is to move away from actual structures causing sovereignty and a move to actual things people do in game these actions would be counted by sovereignty pointssovereignty points would be gained by doing a number of things these include npc ratting complex running asteroid mining moon mining player kills pos kills number of stations owned and gates used by gates used i mean people moving around unopposed should have an effect probably very small but it would work for both the raiders and the people living there unless of course you are camped into your own stations there may be other kinds of things that i havent thought of that could or should contribute and i welcome any suggestionscorrections player kills and pos kills i believe should take a certain prominence in any formula used to encourage pvp and keep the game focused on this path now i dont claim to be clever enough to work out a formula for this to work but i do think there are clever enough people developing this game or playing this game to work it out either themselves or as a groupsovereignty points would be maxed out at a certain number in each system and you can only have max points as long as all connecting systems have a positive amount of points for you as well as you max out the points in that one system the pointsor a  of the points gained there would spread out to other systems nearest first until these are also maxed perhaps some limit is needed here to the maximum range that points can spread this perhaps might be effected by sov levels which would be gained by controlling an area and having maximum points in the system there should also be a standard creep of sov out from central points this would be very slow and gradual but still there and to counteract this should no points be gained in the area a gradual decrease should you gain points but not be from the sov holding alliance the points would be removed from the sov holding alliances total points if they had maximum points in this system though they would not be removed from the system in question but from the nearest system without maximum points i would also introduce a new pos module for stationsystem defence a forcefield generator this generator would project a forcefield over the station that is impenetrable for conventional weapons to break so to shoot and gain control of a station you would have to destroy this module this module would be limited by the sovereignty level you have so you can only have a certain amount per level perhaps 12 should these be destroyed the station would become vulnerable to capture they would also become inactive as the sovereignty level dropped until someone lost sov again making stations vulnerable this would enable large alliances to go into a system and still brute force their way in by destroying all the pos but would also allow the smaller gangs to eventually even take a station themselves by constantly raiding defenders would eventually be forced to fight and couldnt just turtle up in their station and ratmine when people go away to combat these just being replaced they would take a very long time to anchoronline perhaps 1 week even as for the benefits of gaining sov and there should be some i have seen some ideas for various new objects that could be anchored and used at different levels of sov one such idea is asteroid seed bays which over time would increase the quality of asteroids in the belts another would be for the actual true sec ratting rating to increase over time or for specific modules that can be anchored in belts that would increase it perhaps these could be pirate settlements of some kind and finally cynojammersjump bridgescontinued on post 20
first of all i thought your account had been hacked but i see where youre going with thispersonally id like to see poss go down first time theyre attacked instead of the make believe reinforced mode buff them a bit but let them be destroyed first visitcynojammers something needs to change here
nice ideathe sov system needs a change00 warfare is way to mutch focused on large blobs and boring poswarfare nowdayspvp in eve could be so mutch more fun
i definitely support the principle we do really need a more detailed proposal though ccp have specifically asked us on the csm to chase up some good detailed ideas for overhauling sovereignty and its pretty clear there is a serious problem with the status quo any chance of spending a bit of time this week working on the proposal in more detail narciss as long as the op can be updated by a week this sunday august 12th we could submit it to the final csm approval meeting in session 2 prior to the end of august csmccp meets
ive had an idea quite like this for a long timeyoud need a rolling total of points rather than some x day calculation so defenders can build up an advantage they should have something on an inherent advantage just so 00 isnt a total cluster and theres time to plan  but as its rolling it wont help them our for long and only works at all if theyre using spacealso pvp should be heavily weighted in points compared to say mining just because a hulk invasion is conceptually silly the usage points would mainly be a not insignificant top up for people living there something to get carebears involved and useful in the sov game beyond logisticsyoud also need to be able to tradepool your alliances points with any other alliance to allow for rental arrangements  but thats a minor thinglike you i havent really worked out details but theres a germ of a great idea thereedit in case its not clear to explain what i mean by a rolling total of points you get points added daily and they build up for a monthfortnight or whatever but the points you gained 3015 days ago dont count anymore so assuming youve been in that space you have a nice but not insermountable buffer built up when the invasion comes if its a total blitz the enemy might even be able to take over your space while your buffer still counts but if not after 3015 days things are equalized anyway and if theyre still around things are on an equal footing
add a few more metrics and youre golden complexes run lp gained etc so something like this
i think there needs to be a confirmation window available to a victim of an attack in case of accidental or unintentional attacks i was in a group but i wasnt in the same corp as the other guy and he accidently attacked me and was destroyed when nether of us wanted thatthere could be cryteria to be meet for the confirmation one of which is if your grouped or have a good sec ratingi know this can occure alot with power transfers or repair drones because friendly targets and enemy targets are clumped together
there is a confirmation window the thing is you can disable it and a lot of people just disable popups without thinking about it and pay the price for it latersounds like your friend did just that
if all of the changes that are listed in the op post are implemented this will be more than enough to curb the relentless amount of guttless highsec ganking that goes onganking is impotant to stay within eve but when 80 of the gates 10 jumps in any direction from jita have ganking teams or scouts stationed at them 237 yeah you know this side of the game has gotten way too profitable and easily doneccp is taking the right approach here limit ganking but dont get rid of it now if they could only be this even handed with speed and agility
this which is why you wouldnt want a fw forum in therefor these reasons and for a little feuding id say and for some battle reports that details the course of the action if a system is taken or an important battle was held then both sides can discuss but it should have been there from the start just take a stroll along all the boards and count how many fw threads you can find in the different sections if you can find a total 12 on the first 3 pages of all the boards collectively youre a big guy theres been no area to adopt here by fw players boo
this would be like fuing herding cats this is the best example of soul destroying micro management that you can possible come up with pos warfare is butt numbing now this will be the nail the coffini have seen alliances trying to drum up support broadcasting their cta and deploying the airwing i have see them actually schedule times to patrol their borders it lasted less than a week every one got tired of it it made the game suck for them look if you dont have the balls or resources to take my space then you need to go back and drop a pair and start building up otherwise you can do what every other merc and hostile alliance gang does grief the locals that is by far much more fun than staring at a gate or playing capture the flag
i dont play in 00 but agree with your general aimsi disagree with your method of achieving it frankly its too focused on a straightup military notion of attack and defend id rather see a system that took into account a number of measurable achievements on a per system basis each suited to different play stiles in eve online  pvp losses inflicted npc bounties collected mission lp earned poses maintained quantity of ore mined complexes run etc the alliance winning the majority of metrics for any given week takes control of that system for the following week or whatever time period is used to keep constellations from flipping too quickly you could classify any controlled system in which all adjacent systems are also controlled as being invulnerable for the week if that resulted in too few contested systems you could make an exception for dead end systems with only one adjacent system and keep them vulnerable to take over at any timethe general idea would be to spread alliance forces out along the edge of their controlled area and prevent blobbing by presenting numerous play style tasks beyond straight pvp which are illsuited to blobbing because control is fought along the edges large territories progressively become more difficult to maintain control over small alliances strictly focused on small areas of space would be able to compete well against larger alliances with vast resources controlling large areas of space because of the multiple different metrics used to determine sovereigntyit seems to me again admittedly as a 00 spectator that you would stand to bring more people out of high sec by directly appealing to these different play styles as an element of sovereignty warfare pvp components would still be there both as tracked metrics directly contributing to determining system control and as protection forces allowing the lesspvp centered pilots to continue working away at the lesspvp centered metrics with minimal disruptioni dunno a system which doesnt solely revolve around fleet and gang pvp seems far more attractive to me at the very least i think it would stand to make 00 more attractive to the empire dwellersambulation tie in  the ability to display which benchmarks are under threat in contested systems on the tactical map
responding to a few points1 gatecamping is boringholding a position within enemy territory will be as exciting or boring as the enemy makes it the capture and reclaiming times can be tweaked to create a maximum incentive for defenders to interrupt a gate capture rather than wait for it to be complete to reclaim it and contest period durations can be adjusted to reach the right rate of turnover in a conflict between two forces battling for control of a territory whether they are in the same time zone or notby moving a portion of the sovereignty benefits away from pos logistics and onto small ship patrols via stargate capture pos logistics can be simplified to reduce the tedium of maintaining a large pos network lower the territory control benefit derived from pos and the accompanying work required can also be lowered2 distributed objectives are stupid too much running aroundblobsthe contesting of stargates across a constellation or region turns what would be a series of individual fleet conflicts into an ongoing battle for dominance in an area over days or weeks in addition to the single fleet fights over pos we can introduce an additional layer of small scale combat that is measured in small doses across a large space over a long period of time small scale combat can now make an impact on the sovereignty of an area  though small scale combat alone will still never dislodge a sitting power it can however weaken and harass it which leads us to3 this is just to make it easy for smalllame alliances to compete with bigawesome onesclearly a small alliance cannot destroy or dislodge the holdings of a larger equally well coordinated alliance under this proposal it may be that a large alliance currently holding large amounts of uncontested territory through the current system would see new vulnerabilities appear with the implementation of a system like this however given proper organization and the right informational tools which are provided for in this proposal a well coordinated large alliance should be able to maintain control over a large area of space and exploit its resources much in the way they do now it is not the intention of this proposal that large alliances should suddenly become untenable and balancing tweaks of the numbers in the proposal should be made with an eye towards preserving the capability for a talented and organized alliance to maintain territory equivalent to their needsoverall the intentions of the proposal are clearly defined in the op and those intentions are part and parcel to what would be communicated to ccp there should be no fear of hidden agendas within the details of the proposal as the overriding principal communicated here would be to make adjustments as necessary to meet the criteria listed at the start and it would be pretty silly to think that a small adjustable detail would override the broad mission statement
ill also just reiterate that i definitely want to hear feedback on how the goals outlined at the beginning of the proposal can be better achieved and what might make the whole thing more appealing to anyone on the fence about it obviously nothing is set in stone and nothing presented to ccp is ever going to be implemented without proper balancing i do think that this proposal achieves the goals set out during the iceland meeting especially in regards to layering sovereignty warfare and providing objectives for small shipssome of the best changes were the result of community feedback so i hope if anyone has concerns they can offer some quality ideas for how to resolve them
like some stuff here especially moving cyno jammers away from poses so they have to be defended manually doesnt fix the problem of supercaps remote reppng them but at least exposes them to much more risk and its a step in the right direction theres definitly some stuff in here that wont work as is though but might with some adjustment its something ill support since it does take a step in the right direction imo
reads like it was written by someone who has no idea of how tedious 00 is alreadyoh wait
so a large alliance will either wreck a smaller one in one time zone or in many if you cut the time limits you make it time zone dependent domination in one leads to victory in that time zone which can be overturned in the next this leads to stalemate boredom and just going through the motions to repeatedly shift the winner at a certain gate without opposition or it leads to complete victory for any alliance that can overwhelm its enemy round the clock or just in their prime after all if you can swamp them in their prime time without it being yours you can certainly screw them over out of it alarmclocking will only do so muchthen if you leave the time limits you also make it time zone dependent as soon as your attendance drops theirs overwhelms it will just remain as it has been about who can get the most people on the field at the correct time nothing you have said so far will in any way affect that this also just sounds like replacing the current boredoms of pos warfare with a higher class of boredom instead of sitting for an hour shooting a pos while you hope the enemy fleet arrives so you actually get a fight you sit for half an hour on one of many different gates while you hope the enemy fleet doesnt arrive because you cant run away without completely and utterly wasting the 25 minutes youve sat there unless of course youre blobbing which this is supposed to avoid this entire paragraph basically says people who are capable of holding 00 now will probably be capable of holding it in the future well done large corpsalliances that have made friends with other large and capable coprsalliances will not suddenly fall apart the reasons they survive now will be the reasons they survive in the future they have friends theyre not s not as a whole anyway the individual members can be your idea is bad and you should feel badsmall corps fail in nonnpc 00 not because theres some massive imbalance in the code that automatically favours larger ones but simply because the larger ones exist a small group of people who only play in three or four hours out of the day will get kerbstomped by a multinational alliance who are present all day if they couldnt it wouldnt make any sense if two corps the same size can fight over an objective fairly then another corp on one side will take objective two unchallenged if corps three through five join up as well to cover all time zones they will have periods on the clock without opposition if you somehow nerfed huge alliances all that would happen is that the alliances would form and organise out of game as they currently do anyway the game is just not built to be friendly to people who cannot make some ing friends
yes lets allow those who have no holdings in 00 and little experience decide how 00 should be revamped beautiful i agree there is change but i do not in any way shape or form agree with the methods or proposals you have put forth additionally i would encourage those who have a stake in 00 already to come up with a proposal else the empire sloth who has had everything handed to them by ccp will destroy it
i think the proposal would be improved if the barrierforentry for sov warfare were a little higher so that beginning the opening moves of assaulting someones space is something that a group of people has to organize and set out intentionally to dorereading the proposal i think that contesting stargates is still at the oh why not were here anyway level of accessibility if a group of guys has the ships at the gate and things are quiet enough they can do it even if they initially set out just to gank ratters or whateveri think that the ships who are actively contesting the stargate need to be consuming some kind of resource while they do so just like dreads consume a resource while theyre sieged it should also require a specific midslot module this way if a group of people want to get into the sov warfare game they have to prepare to do so before they undock and not just on a lark
okay this is a serious question if this change were to go through wouldnt it make 00 pretty much just an extended version of faction warfare im not a huge fan of faction warfare already so i would hate for it to be a mandatory thing to do day in and day out and without the perks of factional warfare as of now there are very few real perks to living in 00 space and by implementing a need for gate camps around the clock you would drive people away from 00 faster than even pos warfare couldseriously leave the 00 discussion to those who actually live in 00
if you turn eves 00 warfare into a gigantic clone of a world of warcraft battleground im going to cancel my accounts just sayin its the terrible logistical requirements of 00 warfare that keep people playing this game as opposed to any other mmo out there everyone whines about it because it can be a tital pain at times but to be honest when you make things too easy you end up with a game like planetside you go spend an hour or two fighting for control of a few conquerable facilities and as soon as you lock down all the facilities on one continent and move to another 2 people sneak in behind you and capture half the facilities back its the large scale and unforgiving nature of 00 combat that provides the sense of risk actual teamwork and satisfaction when you curbstomp other alliances allowing roaming hac gangs to cripple hardearned infrastructure in 00 space through a series of 10 minute drivebys is not a way to encourage people to move out of empire id think providing additional benefits to sov holders while maintaining the same or at least a similar system for conquering space would be a better approach
also about the timezone games the stages of contesting a stargate should more closely mirror pos mechanics but it would be too tedious to load stargates up with a resource that determines when a stargate changes states heres what im thinkingdefender has captured the gate they have configured the gate with their primetime 000 evetimecapturedattacker contests the gate they configure the gate with their primetime 1200 evetime upon mouseover the gate indicates that it will come out of the contested state at 600 evetime  the midpoint of the defenders and attackers selected timescontestedat the midpoint of the defender and the attackers primetimes 600 eve the gate automatically changes toneutralthe gate can be claimed in the normal way by either the attacker or the defender whichever gains supremacy at the gate first for long enough to do so however if neither side captures the gate within 12 hours it automatically reverts to captured by the defendercaptured by whoever wins the gate or the defender if noone even triesso this way contesting a gate is basically setting an appointment in the future with your enemy for pvp and if a serious attacker brings a fleet of 300 people to contest 30 gates simultaneously in one night such that they all hit neutral at near the same time then its going to be damn tricky for defender to pick where to send a blob this also gives everyone the option of trying to game the time they configure into the stargate for a timezone advantage which takes some intelligenceand by the way ccp cannot be sending out a mail every time a gate changes state no evemails
dats a lot of words over 00 from someone whos never been there keep up the good fight
here is a new requirement we need only people who have spent a serious amount of time living in 00 can propose changes to the way 00 warfare works
i like the idea of setting an appointment for pvp with your enemy but averaging the times inputted by the defender and then the attacker gives most of the control over the appointment time to the attacker though which runs counter to the way pos sieging works and i think gives too much power to the attacker would it not be fine for the defender to just set the appointment time on each gate they controlthe other downside i see is your default outcome once a gate is contested being that it reverts to captured defender if nobody touches it again i guess this is debatable but something i like under the proposals system is that a contested gate goes neutral if nobody touches it again so there is some entropy towards neutrality  i think its important that there is a way for a stargate to go back to its original neutral stateso is there a way to reconcile those two things appointments for pvp even broad ones would be good  but how do you have that without requiring an attacker to essentially attack twice which is already a feature of pos warfare and doesnt seem appropriate for small scale pvp
a on this troll thread kelsin i think the assembly hall needs more of this eveo is pretty boring in general with no one doing anything of significance
heres an option for thisdefender captures stargate and sets a failsafe time this is the time of day at which the stargate will revert to neutral if it becomes contestedif an attacker contests the stargate it goes into contested mode and cannot be interacted with until the failsafe time at that point it returns to neutral and anyone may capture itthe downside here is that the defender now has to show up at a specific time to be sure to recapture the gate thats good for setting appointments for pvp but it puts the burden of meeting those appointments on the defender which may not be something we want for stargate capture since i think it serves better as an incentive to patrol and engage in random pvp rather than set time pvp but id be interested to hear what toman thinksalso the idea of attackers needing to prepare in some way is interesting id avoid a specific skill being needed but potentially fitting a particular module or needing a particular type of resource could be useful still theres something to be said for any ship being able to do it just because they are there perhaps an alternative can be devised but id leave the option open for it to go either way in presenting it to ccp
if i wanted to set a ing appointment for combat i would build a ing time machine dress in a ing frock coat and travel back to the ing 1700s so i could slap the uncouth with my glove and meet them on the heath at dawnif you cant turn up to defend your space or find someone who will do it for you you shouldnt have it
the point really is for it to mirror pos mechanics the averaging of times that i used approximates the effect of strong timing in poskilling an attacker reinforces the pos and then everyone gets a timer to see when to show back up for a fight the downside of how it works for pos is that the defender has to stront and rep towers stronting and repping jumpgates is not appropriate for this distributed smallgang stuff but the appointmentmaking aspect of posfighting is see the fun is if the mechanic motivates people to actually fight each other thats why the attacker needs to show up twice and its why the timing mechanism tries to find a time for the gate to hit neutral when both sides of a crosstimezone conflict might be able to get a few people to show upi dont think that people will like the mechanic if the only way to get fights is to patrol the space or camp contested gates because those two things are kind of boring and because it wont pull enemies from different timezones to the same place and timeyou dont want the defender to have total control over the time that the gate hits neutral because then an attacker in another timezone would have to alarm clock to take a gate
the problem with this proposal is it requires wayyy too much time investment just sitting at gates doing nothing its already bad when we have gangs that go out and sit for hours at gates waiting for dreads to slag towersits also a bit too easy for small gangs to become nuances i want small gang warfare to be viable but this seems too much theres no encentive to actually fight instead of big fights all your ever going to see is small 10 man gangs running around trying to avoid each other and find some out of the way gate to contest just to anoy people and then 10 man gangs comming in after they leavelog to reclaim the system and imagine logging on in the morning to find out that some roaming gang contested half your systems for fun having no intentions of taking over the space at 3am in the morning and now youve got to spend all day going and sitting at them to recapture them sure fine chalk it up to a new system but then it happens again and again and again and befor eyou know it youre logging on eve just to gate sit and do nothing else its a very boring mechanic and does nothing to promote fighting or make things interesting its an interesting proposal but 00 needs more than this it needs fights not timesinks
this increases the cost in vigilance needed to hold space beyond whats currently required if thats part of the proposal then the space needs to made more valuable you see you cant make the space require more effort to hold without also making it more worthwhile to hold itcurrently random pvp has no effect on anyones ability to hold sov in their space to the degree that its going to under this proposal the space needs to become more valuable
true but this comes down to two things 1 what vigilance type activities can we remove from pos warfare to make up for adding some in another form to stargate capture and 2 what benefits are governed by stargate capture that justify that vigilancei mean what if you didnt have to refuel pos would that be a fair tradeoff for having to patrol space what about additional bonuses that help in territory control does that make having to patrol more worthwhile
i dont really know how to suggest a tradeoff like thatjust to be clear what were talking about here specifically is the defender making the effort to recapture gates that have gone neutral and that the attacker has given up on i just dont see the fun in it but i can see the tedium in it im really about the mechanics being fun and encouraging fightsone thing i like about pos fights is that they can be planned for if we have kited an enemy pos and reinforced so that it comes out in our prime we know we can show up at that pos at that time and have a good chance of getting a fight people can plan a schedule around that and organize what i was shooting for was a smallgang version of the same mechanic such that you dont have to cast about hoping for pvp in a small gang but rather have a system that make italmost schedulablea lot of people like how the flow of pos warfare works just dont like the fact that you have to be in a sniper bs in a 200person fleet in a system thats lagged to hell because there are 500 guys in it just to matter
i see where youre going with that what concerns me is that if you try to have a way to schedule small gang fights a single small gang cant make any impact on a larger entity  even just minorly inconveniencing them  because to do so they have to show up at a predetermined time and place where a huge enemy force could be waiting for them what can be done about that
the quick answer is that the defender has to show up whether the attacker is small or not because if they dont then even a small attacker could cost them a gate if the defender is forced to plan organize and show up in force to recapture a contested gate then the small attacker has had an impact that in my opinion is generous given their sizethe pvp is schedulable under your system as posted in the op as well the attacker determines the schedule its 24 hours after they contest all im really doing is making the scheduling a compromise between attacker and defender so as to matchmake some combat and limit the playing of timezone games this way the schedulable pvp wont all be at 4am on a workday for me
arguing over the details of a fundamentally tedious and unlikely to be coded idea is a worse ideathere are some subcomponents of this proposal that seem like a good idea like the getting the cyno jammer away from a deathstar pos this could easily be achieved by simply jacking up their pg requirements to not allow anything else on the pos instead of asking ccp to code anchorable jammers in space away from moons much more likely to get coded that way
by definition yes if a person has never flown a nano ship or combated a nano ship then by definition they know nothing about the nano ship and therefor anything they state is pulled from their imagination of how they think things workif people never encounter a nano ship either as their own vehicle of assault or as an enemy then the mechanics of it are of zero consequence to them and as such their view is completely irrelevant when talking about game balancing issuesso yes only those that have reasonable experience with what is at issue should be proposing changesdont take this as saying that ideas shouldnt be given as that would be quite foolish and would result in stagnation at some point however this isnt an idea to spruce up 00 warfare it is an idea to completely change it there is a big difference as one deals with the content of the warfare whereas the other deals with the actual mechanics
your ideas reflect a course to achieve your goals and to that end you have come up with an elaborate if rough designthe issue is your goalsgoal 1  definitely a good idea the defender advantage currently is a very basic design and quite limited in actual scope and varietygoal 2  time zone issues is partly a metagame issue i personally feel such things should not have that great of an impact as the real world and the game world really should be separate on the other hand there is a reason this exists and the reason is pretty simple it is a game and people that play the game want a chance to play hence putting a tower into reinforced is attackers time where as when it comes out of reinforced is supposed to be the defenders time this is simply so that alliances that cannot realistically be around 247 actually have a chance to accomplish their own gameplay goalstherefore dispersing whatever mechanics so that time zones arent as big of a factor is definitely a good thing ultimately it will always be a factor but the effect can be lessenedgoal 3  your end result is poor as you stated using game mechanics to reduce lag is backwards you have blended real life into the game world which is always bad the goal of multiple fleets should have absolutely nothing to do with performance issues which should be a completely different issue that ccp works on such that any tactic used be it multiple fleets across eve or one huge ass 2000 person fleet battle on the same grid is viablewhatever your third goal here is it should have nothing to do with lag as such it is clear you want to reduce blobbing so you should have a good relevant game play reason for wanting to reduce blobbing ultimately this wont work anyway the simplest way to defend or attack is with overwhelming power play any rts and you will see this happen even if you divide it up so that there are multiple fleets the alliance goal will still always be to maximize the size of that fleetwhat i am getting at is this is a pointless goal the point of trying to stop blobbing not necessarily creating incentive to use multiple fleetsgoal 4  this already occurs although it doesnt always have an effect on sov also nobody is going to want to patrol space even if patrolling is sitting on every gate that leads into your territory nobody wants to do that that is a boring mechanic and a complete waste of a persons time if anything there should be an automated system that tells an alliance when a red enters into any of their systems but god help us if you actually envisioned patrol routes playing security gaurd on the off chance that youll get action is not fun if you want action you seek it outas for giving subcapitals more to do i doubt anybody can actually complain about that variety is the spice of life and anything to break monotony and still be meaningful should be welcomed
id have to disagree with you there lumen i think game mechanics could be fundamental to performance issues if it is more advantageous to have many smaller fleets accomplishing various objectives then the tendency for everyone to glob in one spot would be reduced greatly this might not be easily achievable but the possibility exists
the star fraction do not live in 00 space and hence should not be having any say whatsoever in any 00 space proposalsvoting no
24 hours is too short a period for contestingand the abscence of any need to do something at a particular time rather than at some point in 244872 whatever hours makes it most unlikely that players will ever meet to pvpfurther anything that allows the attacker to pick the time of a defence results in alarm clock raids that are no fun for anyonefinally to avoid that turning into pos warfare butatgates you probably want to force all the gate attacks to run simulateneously splitting up fleetsif we were to go down this road you would have to set a rule that any gate in contested drops out of contested after an hour if all the system gates are not also contested once all the gates are contested a system wide strontiumreinforced mechanic starts up defining the time when the final system defence is going to happen attacker needs to win more than 50 of the gates at the specific time they come out of reinforced to take the systemposs should transmit defensive benefits to the gates so if the attacker wants to go pos shooting before gate camping i guess they caneven with the modifications im suggesting  im not convinced that this is a good idea im just trying to make suggestions to move it from game breaking up to decidedly dubiousas it stands not supported because the proposal causes more problems than it solves
00 needs to made easier to capture hold and needs things that make holding that space more profitableworthwhile the gate contention thing is rediculousthis would make it absolutely impossible to hold space without complete timezone coverage and is a pretty rediculous idea making 00 space significantly more annoying to attack and defend and manage is all it needs to be completely worthless and not worth a damn to actually holdif youd ever lived in 00 you might know thissince you seems to know next to nothing about 00 life its no wonder you might think this a good ideajust because youve repeatedly failed miserably at 00 war this isnt going to make it easierheres some things that actually need fixing maybe the csm could work on making improvments to the already existing game instead of thinking they know how to reengineer part of it they know nothing aboutlagpos setup times are rediculous fix jumpbridges so they only accept ozone and nothing else keep exploration sites from despawning when your connection is interrupted even a 5 minute timer would be fantastic for this00 options that make space more profitable belt minerssystem salvagerssomethingcyno jammers are overpoweredstop ing people who have spent months training into advanced ships only to have them nerfed come up with a game plan and stick to it rather than constantly shifting  around to make things fair if youre tired of nanogangs of ecm then train into something to counter it dont whine and complain until daddy makes the bad men stop touching you
so a large alliance will either wreck a smaller one in one time zone or in many if you cut the time limits you make it time zone dependent domination in one leads to victory in that time zone which can be overturned in the next this leads to stalemate boredom and just going through the motions to repeatedly shift the winner at a certain gate without opposition or it leads to complete victory for any alliance that can overwhelm its enemy round the clock or just in their prime after all if you can swamp them in their prime time without it being yours you can certainly screw them over out of it alarmclocking will only do so muchthen if you leave the time limits you also make it time zone dependent as soon as your attendance drops theirs overwhelms it will just remain as it has been about who can get the most people on the field at the correct time nothing you have said so far will in any way affect that this also just sounds like replacing the current boredoms of pos warfare with a higher class of boredom instead of sitting for an hour shooting a pos while you hope the enemy fleet arrives so you actually get a fight you sit for half an hour on one of many different gates while you hope the enemy fleet doesnt arrive because you cant run away without completely and utterly wasting the 25 minutes youve sat there unless of course youre blobbing which this is supposed to avoid this entire paragraph basically says people who are capable of holding 00 now will probably be capable of holding it in the future well done large corpsalliances that have made friends with other large and capable coprsalliances will not suddenly fall apart the reasons they survive now will be the reasons they survive in the future they have friends theyre not s not as a whole anyway the individual members can be your idea is bad and you should feel badsmall corps fail in nonnpc 00 not because theres some massive imbalance in the code that automatically favours larger ones but simply because the larger ones exist a small group of people who only play in three or four hours out of the day will get kerbstomped by a multinational alliance who are present all day if they couldnt it wouldnt make any sense if two corps the same size can fight over an objective fairly then another corp on one side will take objective two unchallenged if corps three through five join up as well to cover all time zones they will have periods on the clock without opposition if you somehow nerfed huge alliances all that would happen is that the alliances would form and organise out of game as they currently do anyway the game is just not built to be friendly to people who cannot make some ing friendsquoted for truth
you cant present a fundamentally flawed idea and then say well just fix it for me it is analogous to  saying ok guys lets gas all the jews but im open to suggestions maybe firing squad insteadyour idea as has been pointed out many times in this thread will not work it creates more boredom creates bigger time zone problems and creates a ton more lag logging every jump for every alliance member jesus it contradicts the very goals you state that your trying to fix superimposing your small empire corp onto 00 just plain wont worktldr stop killing jews
what a superb set of ideassoooo signed
very good set of ideas and just whats needed to improve 00 warfare the 3 layers of defense fights is a brilliant way to break up blobs and give everyone things to do im not sure the people saying they dont like this idea have read the first posts in the thread support
i think the third goal of creating incentives to field multiple forces is just worded improperly  avoiding laginducing blobs is meant to be a beneficial side effect and i shouldnt have put that as the main point instead incentivizing the splitting up of large forces is meant to be a way to keep small gang objectives small gang friendly to resist the more is always better concept so if you want to go into enemy territory and knock out a few of their stargates youre encouraged to divide your 30man fleet into 3 and cover more territory than stay as a single 30man group likewise a massive 200man invasion is better off dividing into many smaller groups to be more effective the fact that many isolated small encounters would be less prone to lag than single massive encounters is just a beneficial side effectregarding patrolling some have a misconception that this proposal requires defenders to constantly patrol the work of the defender is to perform maintenance on their stargate network in exchange for sovstyle benefits the amount of maintenance is directly related to the amount of attacks on their stargate network in secure and peaceful areas no stargate maintenance is required at all in porous and poorly secured areas defenders will have to recapture stargates that attackers have contested
i think part of the misunderstanding is because you keep referring to the two sides as attackers and defenders when actually what you propose doesnt make any combat likely at allit isnt attackers and defenders its just people running about capping gates at times when the other team isnt online
dont like it for the simple reason that eve sovereignty combat should be about shooting ships not shooting structures theres already all too much shootingrepairing of structures in the game damn station servicesdo you know how boring it is to shoot structures do you know how boring it is to repair themyou probably do why the hell do you want moreremember that the large majority of eve players dont want to fight even fights and there really is nothing in here that forces you to fight so what will happen when someone attacks your structures is one of two1 you can not gather a larger force so you wait until they go away and repair the damage in your tz2 you can gather a larger force so the enemy runs awaywhatll determine the outcome of the war is not whore the best fighters itll be who tires first of shootingrepping structuressomething like this is not going to encourage combat as itll work just like shootable services do the blob shooting them will be bored and the blob who come later to repair them will be boredforget about the split forces thing it is not a matter of can be done quicker if force is split it is a matter of can be done safer if force is not splitsovereignty of a constellation should be determined by the activities successful combat being a large part performed in the constellation
there will always be times when one side is online and another isnt and any sov system  including the current one  allows actions to be taken by each side in that situation acknowledging time zone issues isnt a flaw its a necessity
i support thisboosting defenders side again is not the way to go i thought we all learned from cynojammers and stuff that it helps small alliances to survive but it makes bigger alliances nearly invulnarable so how should smaller alliances ever get space boosting defence makes eve more static and booringreducing the effort for reconnaissance the need for scouts and intel isnt a good way to bring more tactical depths into a game reducing intel to a quick glance into a logfile and connecting it to bacon or similar lame makro  is boring in the ages of jumpbridges logistics are easy as hell making them easier and removing the need for carebears does not concur with the 3 layersconsidering the reclaim time surprise attacks on tactical structures are impossible and fight would be about blobbing contested gatesthe contestet gate stuff is a pure defence boost if a gate falls should give eithera advantage for attackers for holding a gate just neutralising a colour is an extra step to break sov and is no real benefitb drawback for defenders for loosing a gate just making pos stuff attackable is no drawback because it is the situation as it is nowso please no more defender boosts make eve more dynamic again
i dont like the ideas that make 00 warfare even more in the favor of the defender moving out jammersjbs and co to none defended points and have to fight for them is actually a great idea and u then have to do something to keep ur comfort alive that u gain from these structuresi would like a change in the gate system so that if the enemy claims not just contest 100 of the gates in a system every tower of the defender should go into reinforce this would make cap blobs not the only way to deal with poses after a system is already in the hand of the enemy it takes 48h to claim a gate that should have give the defender more than enough time to bring back control over at least 1 gate it will make it possible for small entities to fight for 00 space even if they cant field a big dread fleet to take down a defended deathstar
there are definitely arguments to be made against too great a benefit in defender advantage but also in favor of providing interesting tools for defenders to encourage ship to ship combati do think that the level of defender advantage under this model is pretty tweakable both in terms of the exact numbers on specific benefits and what the benefits are tied to at the basic level the idea is to introduce a constellationwide small gang vs small gang battle into the formula for territory control as well as taking systemwide benefits out of the pos and putting them into tactical arrays in open spaceid be interested in hearing more about what people think appropriate levels of defender advantage arethe philosophy that went into the distribution of benefits under the op is that an attacker begins their invasion of the defenders territory by dispatching small gangs to spread throughout the defenders territory and begin a campaign of contesting claimed gates if the defender cannot either hold their borders and destroy these small gangs or keep up in the maintenance of the contested gates vulnerabilities begin to appear within specific systems where the tactical arrays can then be targeted by the attackerill also point out that this model was created under the assumption that cynojammer arrays will be incompatible with jump bridge arrays  which is another topic entirely but one that seems to be on track to happen
i really like what ive read here so far i support i wish i could add my own perspective on the matter but being that im a new pilot with zero nullsec experience i dont have much to say
if you add advantages but please no bacon 20 for defenders there should also be risks in taking gates so that the defender has the choice to enjoy the advantages and take some risk or leave the gates neutral that would be one optioni would like gates to be something like frontlines if your stuff is within your frontline you have bonuses if your stuff is behind the frontline you should have drawbacks or the attacker should have advantages i like the idea of conquerable gates but this new feature should add more dynamic into gameplay it should be no additional feature for fortress building
current system has defender advantage about rightin fact only thing really wrong with the current system is that ccps severs cant support it
why does it not surprise me that the goons are against this idea
why should the attacker waste their with small gangs instead of just blobbing it up
because 10 ships can capture a stargate as quickly as 50 or 100 its faster to divide up an attacker might choose to blob and contest gates one at a time depending on how they expect the defender to react but they can cover more ground more quickly acting as independent teams
besides small changes i dont see a real effect on current blobbfare just a 3rd barrier gatecontrol is added to conquer space which doesnt include blobbing besides separating tactical modules from pos i support this game mechanics nearly stay the same you have single points of interests pos modules which you blobb one by one it doesnt fix the primary problem boring blobbfare
your proposal introduces another layer of pointless chores on top of pos warfare without fixing 00s underlying problems no 00holding alliance no matter how large or small is going to enjoy staring at potentially dozens of gates for 30 minutes every 24 hours the only people this proposal would help would be empire or npc 00based roaming gangs who want to  up conquerable 00 space but have no longterm plans to hold it this isnt going to open up space for newbie alliances in 00 big alliances will still find ways to hold onto their excessively large territories under your proposal no matter how many ridiculous hoops it forces them to jump through until 00 resource distribution is addressed the game will continue to force 00 alliances to hold huge territories to survive and grow throwing new structures at the problem isnt going to make room for new alliances in 00 or suddenly make existing alliances give up large fleet warfareroaming gangs and small scale warfare absolutely need bigger roles in 00 but conquerable 00 mechanics should be designed primarily to benefit people who live inwant to live in conquerable 00 not npc 00 and empire dwellers out to make conquerable 00 as miserable as possible can you point out one real benefit that your proposal would give a 00 alliancepotential 00 alliance because it sounds like a lot of mindnumbing work for no reward its not going to promote small scale warfare  if 3 tactical arrays need to be killed big alliances will send in 3 fleets of 100i realize im in goonswarm so im biased but honestly any reasonable changes to 00 will be pretty good for goonswarm and bob and ra and all the other top alliances by definition if the game didnt reward alliances with numbers multiple time zone coverage correctly fit ships good leadership and good diplomats something would be seriously wrong
heh goons are doing well with the current balance of power they dont want to fight for their moonz
responding to the above pointskeep in mind that this isnt just adding a layer on top of the current pos sov system it is also redistributing many of the sovereignty benefits currently gained through pos construction into these two new systems destroying pos is still the final blow to an alliances infrastructure but an alliances ability to exert control over their territory is now dependent on their small scale subcapital pvp ability as well  something id argue is indeed a benefit to sitting alliances assuming they have members that enjoy small gang pvpand because it isnt just adding a layer or barrier to entry but actually redistributing sov benefits across three layers it opens up the battle for territory control to a multiple front system where each front governs a different portion of the defender advantagesthis proposal doesnt confer any particular advantage or disadvantage to small alliances or large ones it just takes the currently linear nature of territorial combat and decentralizes portions of it as well as hinges several of the broad benefits of sovereignty on player population activities within the claimed territory any alliance of any size that can maintain a consistent inspace pilot presence in an area will be competitive under this system such that the territory controlled via captured stargates will reflect the active inspace population of the claiming alliance
maybe because we have spent years more than you in 00 and know what the real issues are unlike the op and yourselfbecause you know we hold like 8 regions which 90 of the systems are  compared to high sec mission running this is the core issue that alliances need massive amounts of space to get space decent enough to live in if you reduce the space people need to live make it more worthwhile which i cant see any reason it shouldnt be more worthwhile than highsec missions and make pos more like small outposts it would easily allow smaller corporations the ability to live in 00
lol you want to keep it super easy to defend and make 00 more profitable heh nice balance there chap
i see no reason why this proposal cant include an analysis of how much population 00 space needs to be able to support vs how much population is generally required to hold it  that kind of input would be a great thing to add and id be happy to include some general recommendations that the economic viability of 00 space be readdressed part of the purpose of developing a new sovereignty system based on player population is to avoid vast swaths of unpopulated space perhaps claimed territory could even offer financial benefits greater than unclaimed territory
this statement is a tell that you are completely clueless and have no idea what is going on nice alt troll post btw
you just have to look at what 00 can provide that lowsec and highsec cantrare moon mineralshighend oresofficer geardeadspace gearthe average ratter can make more running level 4s in highsec on an alt in an npc corp than by ratting in 00 on their main the real money to be made in 00 is tied to the selling of things that have a capped demand 00 makes money when empire and lowsec folks buy that stuff from people who live in 00so ccp needs to have their pet economist look at the total revenue from the sales of those items not including sales that end up right back in 00 then subtract out the amount of money spent on maintaining 00 empires posrelated costs jump fuel costs costs for building ships to defend space etc then divide the remainder by the number of people living in 00 the percapita income needs to exceed the percapita income of highsec mission runners otherwise were all better off financially running missions in safetytheres no way to really do the math when alts and multiple accounts are considered besides the fact that a huge amount of highvalue moon mins end up in stuff that is destroyed in 00 fleet flights anyway it just goes through jita first so we can pay the salestax moneysinkhow about they keep making the space more and more worthwhile every patch and well know theyve got right when theres never a time when a 00 empire isnt getting attacked by a newcomer trying to take that valuable valuable space when it becomes universally more advantageous to attack your neighbor for his space than to hold hands and live in peace
the benefits you are talking are not worth fighting for at least for the defender pretty much everyone would just wait them out it would not encourage alliances to defend systems because there would not be any serious longterm financial risk the risk is there only if you can potentially lose the stationsposes meaning the enemy is bringing in big fleets with caps against youyou would need something like 100200 people to keep a 10 gang 237 and have the gates in something like 5 system on your side at what do you get for that very bored pilots and the defender needs to use a bit more fuel for poses and reroute their jumpbridges
there is no financial damage in the stargate capture layer but disrupting a defenders stargate network creates vulnerabilities in their tactical arrays and pos networks  as well as increasing the fuel costs for pos im not sure what you mean with your example  theres no reason an attacker would need to sit on a gate 237 the better strategy would be to continue moving through a defenders territory and contest more gates to strain a defenders ability to recapture them draw their small ship forces out into the open for potential ambush and wear eventually wear holes in the defenders stargate network to generate opportunities to strike at tactical arrays and pos
the first thing i noticed when reading this thread is that everyone patting kelsin on the back and giving him dap for his totally awesome idea are in corps and alliances ive never heard of and have absolutely no political sway in the 00 arena i find this tellingthat said this proposal does nothing absolutely nothing to fix the real problems in 00 jade seems to think its unreasonable for us to ask that people who dont participate in 00 warfare not post four page long proposals on how to completely change an aspect of the game we participate in yet its quite clear from this proposal that the poster really has no idea how deep space warfare or politics works if anything this proposal makes many of the problems in 00 worsebasically to solve the problem of pos warfare boredom youve introduced even more boredom instead of trying to string people out and force them to sit on gates needlessly for huge chunks of time we should be finding ways to make attack and defense faster more brutal there should be serious penalties for not being able to defend your strategic infrastructure perhaps introduce some shadowbane style scheduling so that alliances of different time zones can coordinate for weekend battles but make the act of not defending your infrastructure more painful more quickly as it exists today using blue balls to bore a large invading alliance in to leaving you alone is a viable tactic if you put up enough poss and make them chew through them while you dont defend you can go long stretches of time without losing anything valuable and perhaps cause the attacker to simply get bored and leavethis is what needs to be fixed in 00 if you dont defend your space you should lose it much more rapidly than you do today perhaps some changes to the way reinforced works could facilitate something like this if you actually show to defend then you should be able to hold out for longer periods of time the best defended nations in the world would fall in short order if there were no defenders to man the figurative battlementsalong this line of thought holding 00 space needs to be made worth defending your strategic locations if getting booted back to empire is not so bad then changing all the 00 mechanics in the world isnt going to solve the boring pos warfare problem
its faster and its massively easier to counter if a few people from any one gang die the rest of the gangs time is completely wasted one halfcompetent driveby ends your capture attempt never mind that as ive previously stated youre affixing people in one small area for an extended period while placing no restriction on the opposition your multiple timesaving gangs can be countered by one mobile defence team a well organised one of which would probably include a nice mix of dps ewar tackling and repair and would probably outnumber your capture gang about 21 your gangs will need to be bigger to defend against it meaning theyll use even bigger gangs to fight you and woohoo a spiralling blob warbesides which you still havent explained why the defender should even waste their time reacting nothing happens immediately so just let the attackers send their small gangs to do nothing for 3060 minutes when they leave you can just pop in and reclaim them in half the time the only way to avoid it would be turning gatecamps into semipermanent affairs and one thing the game doesnt need more of is hanging around doing sweet  all while you wait for an arbitrary timer to count downreduce the conversiontime to make the retaking of gates more urgent kill single timezone alliances leave it as it is kill single time zone alliancesi still have not seen a single explanation from you about how this makes smaller corps more capable or how being forced to spend hours just sitting on a gate would in any way make the game more entertaining
you mean we are supposed to make more money on highsec mission alts than in space that we can lose shock and horrorthis is why you should not be allowed to post on the topic if you clearly have no grasp on what the situation is
if it super easy to defend for goonswarm why is it not super easy to defend for everyone elsesnypa
perhaps you should address the contents of the ops post instead of dismissing it out of hand because it mentioned a dev you dislike or better yet perhaps you should not reply to threads whose contents you have neglected to read a single jot concerning
on the assumption that the scope of the proposal will be redefined along the lines as discussed above supported
fair enough you asked for it the above is a completely unsubstantiated claim name names please or this is just selfserving spin to justify a vague agenda also werent the same or very similar carrier issues already broughtup before and then voted againstso who exactly is this silent majority again isnt this just a big fancy nerf for older players who have already spent the time years to trainup for carriers ok so carriers need a specific role i can see and probably agree with that but what role exactly windjammer pretty much sums it up for me too and it seems like the op is merely venue shopping there are no clear boundaries presented here and it would seem the op is simply looking for carte blanche to change things which are not welldefined i guess if it all got changed and things went badly ccp could always point at the csm and say but you asked for itbefore the csm gets behind any new nerfs or buffs or more junkets to iceland how about pressuringbegging ccp to fix the things that are actually broken i am of course talking about lag and desyncs id like these real problems to be the 1 priority and focus with ccp since these seem to be somewhere around the 8 or 12 priority at the moment
what makes you think that goonswarm is not susceptible to this nerf
ive complained about this a few times and weve already seen a decrease in time for dictor bubbles but i think its time to take another look at these shipsfirstly you now have heavy dictors which imo are much more balanced for what they can do they get great tanks but their effects die with their shipsthe current problem with dictors is they drop a huge sphere warp disruption that can bubble huge chunks of a fleet even if the ship dies their effect lingers either until you can mwd out of it which takes huge amounts of time or until the bubble drops up to 2 minutes after the dictors death the ships are cheap and very disposable making thier suicidal tendencies even greater and ships are still allowed to warp on grid which is probably the most ghetto feature in game as its too easy to warp to wrecks id have less issue with ship to ship warping stayingso the fixdictor base speed increase back to original values this should become their primary defense again while not being overly powered as the speed nerf comes in2 bubblescurrent dictor bubble timer 10 secvolume 1radius 20kmnew bubbletimer 2 minvol 10radius 255kmlauncherrof 10secvolume 20reload 30secthis means the dictor now relies more on its own survival than before its bubble selection will dictate more of how much of an effect it can have the longer duration bubble can still work on gates if the dictor is placed in allingment the shorter and longer bubble can both be used for poddingvolume and reload would affect mass spamming but still allow a good coverage with the larger bubbleessentially what this does is remove 1 ship from being the catchall of support in small combat and fleets right now most fleets gear around 2 ships bs and dictors all other ships seem to be lost because tackling is left strictly to dictors
thank god theres no lag in eve that would really have made this change unviable
i fail to see how a ship that isnt insurable and costs 20mil is cheap
pretty much
have you played this game lately i like this arguement an alliance brags about alliance funded dreads replaced on a whim and they complain about a 20mil isk ship
yes bc lag doesnt work in both ways good job cookie for you
this idea and person are stupid is hurtsship to ship warps are bad wtc you smoking do you even know how to play this game
not everyone gets their ship from the alliance nor should you be encouraging a change that would render the cheaper version of heavy dictors totally unviable for larger fleetsyou still need to explain whats so fundamentally broken about small fast ships being able to drop bubbles that persist beyond the existence of their own ship  especially because the bubbles can and usually do trap the dictor and importantly their pod that dropped thema couple of things that you apparently dont realise battleships should never take longer than ten seconds to align if you know how to manage your mwd so a ten second bubble is utterly meaningless in the context of pretty much any fight if its usefulness is so entirely dependent on heavy lag then good god im glad you have no say in the development of this game fleets are never so tightly concentrated that you can bubble them with the smaller 2 minute bubble even gangwarping them to a single point will result in their being dispersed over a greater area than the bubble would cover unless the dictors timing and placement are absolutely perfect if youre suggesting a change where the longer two minute bubble is incapable of tackling anything for more than ten seconds hey even a rorqual will be able to traverse it in less time than it takes the bubble to expire youre rendering the ship utterly useless except for gatecamps  which are one aspect of pvp that arguably needs to be deemphasised
good job reading i think i said those could stay get rid of wrecks next
furthermore why shouldnt 1012 dictors be required to work more together rather than the theme be burn for the middle drop and praynext
because we have worked hard to provide expensive things to our alliance and believe me they are expensive we should believe they are because we can do it mr churchill believed the war against germany would be winnable he did not believe it would be cheap
they will do exactly the same thing but more often with your suggestions this is ridiculous
and how does that argue against dictor effects being changed at all
one dictor is never enough to tackle a capital or support fleet entirely independently because itll never survive against a competent support fleetunless youre the kind of alliance that likes to cyno their titans 300km off capital fleets without anything to support them they might survive that
it is an argument against your premise of them being cheap which is a main premise of your argument just because your enemy has worked hard to provide a weapon against you does not mean that because they have that means it is cheap if it were cheap the requiem would have a program of their own but since you dont this point is mute and clearly just an argument to change the game to your own advantage when you cannot do so ingame
its not about 1 dictor its about 810 doing the job of 30 support people newer to this game dont seem to remember the day the frigate class actually did something in fleets more than zoom around like tards
this has nothing to do with our current war in fact ill gladly go find about 1012 past history post on this same topic from myself the fact that its been proposed now is strictly coincidencehonestly pl deserves praise for the use of heavy dictors in fleet lately bc theyve been quite good with them
well you need to tell me how you anticipate dictors being able to coordinate at the level youd like them to in the sometimes laughably high lag that youve already accepted exists once youve done that you need to deal with  ohidontknow  everything else thats been said in this thread regarding the time it takes to traverse those bubbles the ability of dictors to survive against a support fleet and maybe if you have time you could even respond to the titan burnthat said i think theres probably a deeper reason why you posted this thread have your tacklers not been responding to the pep talks anymore
im not sure davey i think you need to take a long hard look at yourself and decide whether you really belong in 00
i could care less if i kill a tech one goon frigate as long as im getting kills every kill is a kill
well the idea is to not have equal fights it draws them into your game more they cant cloak if you make em chase you so dont fight them but kill them every chance you get do you have any questions about that
lag cant be the argument bc no ship can coordinate in high lag its just a crap shoot you cant design a game around lag
nice post broheim
ya this idea is pretty terrible first dictors go slow because they prenerf could catch some interceptors thus making interceptors obsolete ask for anything other than speed and that is worth considering but no to speed on dictorssmall 255km bubble is useless if you have ever been in a large fleet you should know it is quite impossible to put that many targets in a 25km sphere even a 3 bs gang would get out of a 25km sphere without even tryinga cool new bubble would be a 30 second 3035km bubble or a 1015km 5 minute bubble i could see situations where i would use such bubbles but i can never see a situation where i would want a short range bubble your comment ahout fleets being only made up of bs and dictors shows your ignorance in actual ingame combat sure those ships are needed the most but instead of reading your alliance op mail actually join in the battle and see what actually happens on the fiedl of play
youre probably not aware of this but luckyduck is a former bob fleet commander who became infamous for a pep talk he gave to rise shortly before the fall of rit he left bob during the delve campaign a while back to join requiem hahahahahahahahaha
in any amount of lag at all the small bubble is utterly worthless unless your dictor is stationary at the time you drop it because even a one second delay between your keyboard and the server will have you overshooting the target and a 10second large rebubble is grossly overpowered as it lets you reposition a new bubble to account for the targets movements every 10 seconds making it impossible for large ships to burn outplus as mentioned by another poster returning dictors to their original speed is to completely sideline interceptors and t1 frigates for that matter in 00 combat because that is what was happening before their speed was cut
dont really agree with this at all i dont really see why something that isnt broken should be fixedthe reason warp disruption probes sit out there for so long even if a dictor dies is because they are probes a hictors bubble is powered from the ships own grid it does not launch the bubble a normal interdictor launches a self powered probe its only common sense that the probe it launches will be self powered and last more than 10 secondsi do agree to an extent that dictors are slightly overpowered for what they do but i cant honestly see any realistic way of nerfing them infact the only thing i can see as a decent addition to the interdictor is to make the deployment of a bubble aggressive to prevent them from jumping out i know if someone tries to warp inside a dictor bubble that gives aggro but a dictor should be aggroed before that even happensalso agree with the guy above returning dictors to their previous speed is an absolutely rediculous idea for the reasons mentioned  they would make interceptors and t1 frigs completely obsoletesorry yaay just really dont agree with you on this one
how about a really simple way of fixing a problem taht imo doesnt exist make the probes shootable but make it either have a really low sig radius so it takes time to lock or give it a largish amount of hp
i dont think luckyduck is a smart man i think he is wrong
objectively i have to give this idea a thumbs upi guess the occasional spark of brilliance can come from even the basest form of life in eve
good idea theres more to a pod pilots life than yarr some are just too scared to realize it j
this
only if a variety of dance emotes come along with ititll be the swg cantina all over againoh and it makes for good viral videos as well
its not somethign we need but would be fun fluff once the main elements of the add on are in place
no no no no and no it brings nothing to eve and besides i cantremember last time i played eve with sound active
they really should work on that
jesus god almighty yes yes and yes again
i likes
support some pod pilots such as myself would enjoy lighter pursuits when not murdering thousands of helpless crew members or buying and selling the value of a small planetalso the only arguments against so far are those levelled against ambulation itself resources lol and but i dont want it
i like
dont do copying but given game balance issues then i support this thread
a small but good request
thanks for ignoring the critical and lo bit oobgod damn son you didnt read the op either
now that all the goons have votedno its ment to add diversity of ships carrier gaining this effect again would limit the amount of use of rouqals and jump freighters bc people wcarriers would solo haul every thing rather than actually train for freighters or ask for help why waste time and money on a virtually undefendable ship to move that valuable cargo when you can run a carrier and defend better
way to read the op
maybe just make it so haulers cant have anything in cargo but other ships caneither way supporting
as long as its cheaper to haul mass quantities of stuff via jump freighterrorqual they will still see use my carrier alt trained up jump freighters for this very reason carrier got hit hard with the nerf as it pulled much of the intended ship hauling functionality out of the carrier and also eliminated much of the isk making potential you got from having one in deep 00 space if youre going to rat in 00 and are smart you dont use a carrier ccp intended jfs for large alliances so what are the smaller alliances supposed to utilize
with the added ship cargo and the jump distance bonus a carrier would easily replace a rouqal with this change if they say hey ok sure but no haulers then id support it
approved
correction i supported the vne damage effects in this thread on the first page not the other thread
lmaoyou amuse me i dont think i have ever met someone so self adsorbed and convoluted in my lifegood luck with that edit theres always air huh keep toking on that hookah it will solve every thing for ya
again you attack me and tell me that i am the problemvacuuma vacuum is a volume of space that is essentially empty of matter such that its gaseous pressure is much less than atmospheric pressure 1 the word comes from the latin term for empty but in reality no volume of space can ever be perfectly empty a perfect vacuum with a gaseous pressure of absolute zero is a philosophical concept that is never observed in practicekeep making yourself look stupid rezaa

nikon i meant drones d
this ill give my support to this thread for this sentence alone the devs are nuking speed far to hard and way beyond reason yes that is a travesty against the entire player basebut at the same time they are nuking maneuverability even harderdoing one is the worst idea they have ever had doing both makes me seriously worry about the balance teams sanityalso i dont see any of the speeds that are listed by the op that are unreasonablebottom line balance devs if you need to perform game killing modifications like these do only one at a time that way eve might have a slim chance of survival but a double shot like this falls directly into the old assassins credo two to the head you know their dead these two ideas together are like two directly to eves crownmake the right choice devs choose life
hmm i know that a lot of people loved the feeling of flying a fighter and that the speed was entertaining but does anyone wander why the devs are trying to make this changesure many will be too simple and will only say because of the whiners but thats only those dense idiots who cant read between the linesdevblog mentioned that their physics engine was going haywire when ships got up to speed seems to me that their choices were to rework the entire physics engine or nerf the modules that allowed ships to go at that speedi may be completely wrong but eve has had a background of show ship combat speed and being top gun is fun sure but these developers who have been managing and improving a great game for five years now might have a sincere reason for changing such an enjoyable portion of the gameso many assumptions made on all of our parts the ones i see most commonly by the naysayers are that devs are trying to kill the game or they dont play it or they are out to get you its as pitiful as listening to your dad complain about who stole the remote
hard limits are dumb just lower polycarbons to the same as aux thrusters and lower the speed boost given by pirate implants and boosters possibly lower skirmish ganglinks slightly oh look i just fixed nano
these are not speed limits just a speed guideline for ships of a certain class speed fitted with rigs but without faction boosters gangs or snakes etc
hmm i totaly agree that pvp should not die and it sure will not die because of only a group of players pvp is whats eve all about but there is an idea that crossed my mind that could maybe solve your problemcorp a is your kind of corp  mining hauling not attacking anyone and that kind of stuff corp b is a big bad wolf declaring war on your corp just to fill their killboards with easy pickings my idea is that corp b can only declare war on corp a if someone from corp a attacked someone from corp b now lets see where this leads us miners and haulers from corp a are totaly secure in highsec thus being able to enjoy their game in lowsec members of corp a are not so secure because even if a war could not be declared someone could attack them at any time but again since the war couldnt be declared they would be safe again if they move to high sec also attacking someone from corp a in low sec will result in standings loss since they are not valid war targets thus protecting them from big bad pvpers with positive sec status or low enough to be able to get into highsec space in 00 there are no rules there shouldnt be any rules there and i doubt that a friendly poor unprotected minerhauler would even consider going therethis is just my opinionenjoy your game
all pvp in eve is consentualyour idea is crap but if it were to go live we should implement the reverse after all corp a is a bunch of wealthy industrialists corp b is a group of starving piratesbecause corp b has not sold anything to corp a at greatly inflated rates corp a may only sell things at base mineral cost 10 to corp b any items marked higher than that are rerated because the two corps have not agreed to a buying warnow corp b can fight in peace knowing they wont be slaughtered in the pvp market arenagalan
how about this corp a decs corp b and they fight but corp b also has alt corp c that provides them with the resources to fight by your suggestion corp c is invulnerable while still providing war support to b a is massively disadvantaged
epic
an epic and bad line but the truth nonetheless eve is a niche game because it is difficult and because of its basis in open pvpccp has over the last several years opened the gates of eve to a larger audience by first making highsecurity and since reinforcing greifing laws which is why we dont have a 5k playerbase and which is why fully half the playerbase stay excusively in highsecthe players who enjoy pvp see these carebears as nothing but fun targets and tears they dont see that without them the game they enjoy so much would lose over half its income they also dont see the large percentage of socalled pvpers who would leave the game players who arent looking for pvp only for an easy grief and who wouldnt find any interest in a carebearfree world where the only opponent has teeth and is willing to use themi think the real issue is that pvp should progress so that players can become comfortable with it but also so that they never get it in their head that eve is anything but a pvp game no huge barrier between low and high sec no more allowing players to think that they can be completely free of pvpwardecs are a different matter they are completely biased towards griefers they rarely are used in high sec at least for anything other than farming carebear tears and they are unbalanced but you cant remove them completely without adding a substitute method for introducing pvp into highsec
you consent to pvp when you subscribe you are a pvper because you play eve youre jsut not a very good one
hugs not slugs people
troll 310
sukiotaking you at your word that this has happened and it doesnt surprise me at all as ive been on the receiving end there are optionsfirst of all  ccp has already mentioned that the wardec system is going to be reworked as currently it amounts to a pay to grief plan so to some extent your plea was heard even before you made it others have been where you arefixing it however will take awhile and game design being what it is may not take the first time arounddespite what many of the more silly people i saw posted eve is not pvp only nor is pvp purely consensual that can only be said to be true if playing the game is considered to be consent however a certain amount of non consensual pvp will always be part of eve and in fact really needs to beyour best response against these guys is actually to roleplay it imagine the ccp wardec fix as something meandering through the halls of yulais legislative board and take action as your character would based on what youre presented witha bunch of scum have wardecced you pleas to the authorities even if they do not fall on deaf ears will take time possibly lots of itwhat to doyouve already said you dont want to fight thats fine there are many merc corps happy to do that for you consider hiring one of them if that isnt an option then you must consider ones which dont involve combat one is to simply move to an area which lacks this kind of griefer i can tell you of a few where you will be welcome they may not be as lucrative but without the hassle youll probably wind up both happier and with more isk than with the hassle if changes go through you can always go backthe other option is to scatter for awhile into npc corps and come back later on wait out the griefers as they will get bored with no targetstry some of those and see if one is a good fit i hope this helps some and you are able to resolve things to your satisfaction
if your having trouble with hisec griefers hire someone to defend youbeing a carebear corp you should be able to afford that
hey jarvis great post what a way to handle this issue with maturity and actually post something helpful to the op
agree after a carefull consideration of my own idea i have to agree with you also well it looks like the best solution isabab
no support quite simply the titan is not a mobile station and never should be if as you state ccp wanted it to be that way they would have made it a totally diferent ship to what it is nowi have no problem with looking at the ddd issue discussion could be enlightening personally i have no problem with it and looking to make the titan generally more of a logistical tool but you are yet again asking for permission to change whatever you want to suggest without really giving us a set of parameters to make a conscious choice betweenit also makes me laugh when you quote the overwhelming attitude amoung 00 players and yet we only have 4 pages of discussionobviously an overwhelming amount of comments on the subjectrather than make suggestions to nerf the ddd abilites how about nerfing cyno jammers which the majority of titans hide behindmy twopenneth
a doomsday weapon is supposed to be a lastditch attempt to take the enemy down with youas such the doomsday in my humble opinion should do a lot more damage but should also completely obliterate the titan using it this way when your titan is about to go pop you can ensure that the fleet taking it down suffers too
reading lavista vistas posts really made my day nande yanen do run for the csm next election it would be nice to have someone that actually knows what hes talking about
this proposal is preposterous in the extreme people devoted a very significant portion of skill training vast mineral resources vast monetary expenditures and a significant amount of time waiting for it to finish being constructedthey did this in order fly what the titan is now in its current statethey did not train all of these skills and spend vast amounts of resources for a mobile space stationthis is a resoundingly poor proposalchanges do need to be made to the titan but changing the very essence of what the ship does will alienate the players who had no intentions of one day flying a mobile pos
supporting this
when the titan was originally conceived by ccp they meant for it to be a gigantic fleet support craftthey gave it a ddd just so it could have a special attackthen players made too much damned money and mass produced titansnow they bring a dozen death stars to a battle and spam dd until everything is dead now titans are a fleet annihilation craftplayers training up for them arent training for the ship as it was intended they are training up to be one of 12 or more pilots to drop a titan onto the blob fightfixing the titan with such a drastic change is completely warranted given the apparent lack of selfcontrol by players if they can so blatantly abuse the system with extreme overkill then its up to ccp to take that source away
interesting ideas and certainly would make the ship more useful make ddd a defensive option that can only be fit and fired while in station modeedit this is from another thread but i thought it might be a good idea make the destruction of a titan in stationcommand center mode part of a definitive win condition of a war dec
so in short turn it into a death starand thus supported
so wait your argument is that ccp should do what youand those who share your opinion want and ignore the desires of meand those who share my opinionwho the  are you to decide whose opinion is more important than anyone elses arrogant much
solar flares tend to be very common
i like this idea in theory but please be careful about it the only places you can really put them are gates or stations since people dont really have much cause to go elsewhere if you put them in missions youll only upset the mission runner crowd since itll make repetitive missions even more tedious anyway maybe if they appear in highsec concord or some other empire fleet will come and clean up lowsec wouldnt have that luxury so things might be interesting down thereim just tossing ideas around here personally i think lowsec is dangerous enough but im a carebear so what do i know are you for realof course he thinks his opinion is better than yours if he didnt he wouldnt have posted against you this is how and why arguments discussions and negotiations happenyou made a point disagreeing with the op citing realism in space to be honest wow is more realistic than eve he refuted or merely rejected if you prefer that point saying that eve is a game rather than a simulation and that fun should take precedence over faithfully remodelling a vacuumperhaps im prudish but i dont consider your remark to be terribly politewho the  are you to decide that posting a rebuttal constitutes a personal attack arrogant much
i like this idea obviously there are tons of considerations to take into mind when designing it but i sure like the thought of environmental dangers
poor poor poor jita alts just think of the magnetic storms in that area notice i approve
space whales
a rebuttal is all well and good but when i see the words get over yourself i tend to interperate them as a personal attack but perhaps thats just me not sure why thats arrogant but then again if you hadnt implied that it was you wouldnt be able to hilariously twist my words
perhaps your insecurity is showing through if you interpret any comment made to be a personal attack against youperhaps your first post was actually rather arrogant in itselfwould have us believe that you yourself have been out there charting the farthest reaches of distant galaxies and you know for a fact what does and does not happen regularlysimply displays your own superiority complex lording your knowledge of the cosmos over we lowly and confused mortalsso perhaps i did intend insult upon you and yours or perhaps i merely meant to speak upon the topic at hand that being the added space content to any otherwise lacking space video gameperhaps those who participate in these forums should develop a thick skin before taking offense to any and all contradictions to their inputperhaps
defo got my support
supporting this idea
i wonder if the csm is the right way to get this to ccps attentionits simply that gate and station guns shoot drones and remove an amount of dronerequiring ships from piratingif a hauler gets ganked by a astarte or eos domi or mega typhoon or maelstrom doesnt do much difference to him  being able to choose from more ships would be nice tho
cant you just have some non drone friends tank the gate guns for you
the guns cycle targets
i support this i loose more drones then we manage to loose ships so something is wrong
well this idea is just bad
official issue thread for contract improvementsalready being looked at though i dont think your idea is workable as it stands so no support from me for this though i do believe courier contract improvements are sorely requiredadding your thoughts to that thread might be a better idea than creating a new thread as itll likely have more chance of being considered
theres plenty of penalties for theft if they take your stuff you keep their collateral and if youre sensible the collateral is set about 20 above the value of the cargo so that you really dont miss it if it goes away
isnt this really more of a bug report thing
yes and when engaging multiple targets in a nano hac it can be very tricky to avoid drifting into web range of any target as the second you do you die also if you bump into anything station asteroids other people you are almost instapopped by large guns  missiles making nano pvp very risky in this sense
no this game has been changing since the day it came out and it will always continue to change or it will die stop being an ignorant twit and grow a brain
so please enlighten me that why that qualifies you to speak for the entirety of the eve communityi like playing eve therefore i represent the majority of eve because the majority of eve plays the game i is have good smart
1 30 seconds of cloak time at a gate will not give you enough time to get your buddies to help all you will end up doing is getting your buddies killed which is what most gate campers want you to do any way 2 not all stations are like that some have an insane dockdock range some as far as 60km i have seen plenty of folk make it back with in plenty of time i am not to sure what makes you so special you cant and if it is a specific station move3 guaranteed linkage
i agree that those who play the docking game are extremely frustrating to deal with doesnt mean that station ganks should be handed kills as they are at these stations it would be nice to see some creative ideas to find a balance between the dockgank problem
or we could reduce scan probe launcher cpu from 220 to 100 or even 75 and open up the use of many current models of ships to fill this roleyeah its that easy
or yeah this would be helpful as well
scan launcher cpu reduction is a good idea also  so there are currently 3 solutions that would make exploration a little more funany other ideas or drawbacksoverlooked results if probe launcher cpu reduced or exploration stuff allowed to work whilst cloakedarithron
i for one really hate certain kinds of peoplejust because you hate certain kinds of people doesnt mean you should be any meaner towards them but in any case words are just words if you get angry because of something that someone you do not know had said in a fairlyanonymous online chatroom well lets just say that there are people better than you better people dont get angry at wordsi certainly am against the automatic filtering of chat channels if it gets abusive then certainly ask for a moderator gm to intervene hey thats how it is nowthe game isnt made for children its made for adults if you cant handle words grow up
personally i do not see where this sort of thing has anything to do here eve should be as open to cursing extremism and despicable personalities as any other public forum why because eve is a sandbox game and because it will be all the more satisfying to sink people who express things like that out of the skyi should say though that i am not talking about taking this sort of thing to the extreme here eve is still a game with rules of course and forums still have rules as well but such inoffensive things as cursing personal bigotry and general stupidity should not really be limited unless it degenerates into spam or moves up to an organized scale such as neo corporations for exampleand yes this is coming from someone who cares very little for political correctness and who can easily be targeted by said bigots but my common sense and the civilized man in me both say that anyone who has a problem with things like this on such a minor scale and who wants to weed even the slighter signs of bigotry out is likely either oversensitive or a manner of bigot themselves
actually you seem to be the one who has failed to read the first line it says that its subject to change according to player input if players are contacting the csm to voice their inputseems to me that they have a clear understanding of what the first line says the csms objective is to represent the players concerns as you well know and therefore they have every right to expect you to listen to their concernsin fact if you are simply ignoring their concerns in favor of your own priorities it is you that is not living up to expectations of being a csm and not them that is misusing the csm
truth and its why we made the speed issue number 1 agenda item on sunday there is very significant player sentiment that the nanonerf is too much and would badly damage the 00 game at the moment by promoting blobbing and removing a counter we need to be discussing this and using any influence we do have to ensure the speedchanges are more reasonable and appropriate buffs to guerilla warfare are made at the same time the overall speed penalty comes in
you can have it if i can have passive armor regeneration
the enyo is the hands down coolest looking ship in the game it reminds me of a ducati however it doesnt do anything particular well i only fly it when i want to pick up the femininasar
the key issue is speed here and assault frigates are not toned down because they have a low base speed compared to other frigates but because they often lack midslots limiting tackling options and even more significantly they need to use their capacitor reserves for something else than running a microwarpdrive with the extreme emphasis on speed that has been created due to the use of mwds this means that afs have been as good as left in the dust rendered useless due to the fantastic speeds attainable by other shipsthe solution cut mwd efficiency severely or remove them from the game entirely and give universal armor bonuses to the afs we have had pretty much enough of the nano excess by now the jokes over ccp lets make armor resists missiles and ecm useful once more and let the element of tactics back into the game
my post was not a reply to your dariushowever if the topic regardless of what it is gains enough support it should be looked at you said it yourself some csms have been not only proposing and bringing their own ideas before the council and have also been quick to jump on ideas with little to no support from the community while ignoring ideas like ship balencing that gained significant support then argued that those changes are trivial while their changes are not so how difficult is adding powergrid to the nighthawk compared to letting people play instruments in ambulation well the answer is obvious but one is before the council almost without popular support and the other failed at council one is completely outside the characteristics of the eve universe and the other is blatently obvious in terms of how you cant fit the ship in a way that it is designed to be fitted and come close to competing with the other css one would throw a huge amount of work on the dev team and the other is editing a single statistic in a filemy point in posting the rights of the player and the voter communications was to show that no where did ccp specify that it had a right to tell the csm what is and isnt important and no where did it say that the csm can determine the relative importance of a matter to the community it did say it would require a 50 vote but seriously 110k  votes even the csm has agreed that is over the top so even you have abandoned that ideaas for the csm trying to promote a csm vision of the game it isnt you or lavista and it i bet 910 forum dwellers could guess right off which csm it was that keeps spouting it
knowing if something is worth breaking into would somewhat defeat the point of a isecurei can imo

i find the 5 remote rep bonus useless and its lack cap stablity makes the nidhogger terrible the archon out tanks and is much more cap friendly the fact it armour tanks dosnt bother me the fact the archon is better at remote repping in prelonged engagements does
anyone know when they will make this improvement i have a minny cap now but have not trained for the cit torps yet if they change that i would like to know asap so i dont have to if they dont change it i may just train for the gallente dread even know the minny one looks awsome
you want me to online how many guns
i agree the issue needs to be looked into and something needs to be done to make the arduous task of setting up poss easier or at least less tedious than they currently are its one thing to take a long time to set up but its another to make on of the few directors in each corp be responsible for 8 hrs of mindnumbing clicking and sliding mods around
i tried using nano curse ishtar and vaga on test curse and ishtar died incredibly fast against anything with missiles vaga lasted longer but still died fairly quick definitly too quick to do any real damage
definatly against this nano nerf
good about time the elitist pvpers have to replace t2 ship losses on a regular basis rather than get easy ganks i hope ccp nerf pvp further in future patches and cater for the long suffering silent majority of eve and buff up pve in many areas
i am all for a nano nerf but these changes go way way way beyond that please dont do this not as specced out on sisi anyway
people please go on sisi and see the diffrence a vaga can reach just under 3kms without i repeat without snakes all is not lost for the nano 3kms coupled with a decent passive shield tank will make for a decent ship not the beast it was before but still a useful vessel balancing is required and i think this just might work nano gangs can still break through gate camps with minimal losses but now its not suicidal to go against a nano gang with nonano ships
same here nerfing eve to nerf nanos is wrong wrong wrong change as little as possible to knock the nanos down a peg dont change the whole damned gamesigned again and to remind people once more a large stacking penalty boost is in order with changes to min and max speeds for ships like the vaga and perceived too fast ships not this insane blaster boat killing minmatar slaughtering mwd demolishing nerf bat with spikes thats all it takes is some small changes to specific things which narrows mistakes even further ccp is bringing a sledge hammer to attempt a brain surgery
well with ccp giving us its latest balancing i feel if i continue playing i will be reduced to hog tying my enemies only going 1ms while chucking rocks out my cokpit windsheildfirmly against
i dont like this nano nerf at all but i do like the added abilities of a scrambler
ccp proves yet again they have no clue how to take small steps to a greater goodinstead they blanket nerf a race into uselessness
i dont really nano i fit a mwd to my blaster boats some istabs overdrives depending on what i am doing i can see how speed needs to be altered to fix issues with the ships that lie 3 standard deviations out of the mean but hell this breaks too many things blaster boats are gonna suck now missle boats are getting a major boost it is just too much im not sure how interceptors will do their job now without being flying coffinsi vote hell no

dont care about skill training while inactive but i shudder to think how many accounts are only activated once every couple of months just to collect a mountain of datacoresso dont care about sp but inactive accounts collecting rp is ridiculous
the only problem with removing rp increase on inactive accounts is that it should be done in a fashion that will not block regular rp increase in active accounts requiring to do the daily mission will change the research agents usage a lot deactivating rp generation when the account subscription is not payed dont seem so linear to implement as it will require transmission of data between the account management and the game world and that can be a security weakness i think if that is simple to correct i am in favor of removing the rp production but not the skill training from inactive accounts
the rp collection i agree is somthign that needs to be fixed a simple fix is a time limit in which you ahev to talk to your agent say once a monthhowever skill finshing when the accounts inactive is fine one of the best bit about the game is its flexabilty around my real life
i agree with what a lot of people have already said expired account rp gain is just stupid this needs to go this hurts the economy and i am certain the real money for isk leeches are taking full advantage of it somehowexpired account sp could be argued either way mostly i side with you shouldnt be able to put sp on an expired accountstill the rp situation deffinately needs looking into so ill give the thread my support based on that idea
go to hell
go to hell

im ambivalent about the rp gain aspect but ill happily offer a firm no to removing sp gain from inactive accounts i think that was something ccp did well from the start and removing it will hurt evealso i would think these are two distinct issues that should have two distinct threads for discussion
go back to wow noob this is one of the key features of eve
ccp seem content to keep shooting themselves in the foot i see no reason not to go ahead with this

after having reviewed the stats you have my grudging supporthowever i think you should adjust a few things like keep highgrade snake implants up to 30 work to make some ecm alternative like tracking disruptors or sensor dampeners viable to scramble and disable missiles as defender missiles are just a waste and not beat on the webifiers and overdrive injectors so severely and i will be determinedly continuing to propose alternative means hoping that the developers will somehow notice

hi mom
nano nerf is needed

i like the nano nerf
i think a month worth of testing will balance out the changes so im for the current proposal although i do think the web nerf is a little extreme

im here to play internet spaceships not internet planetary flights
facetiouswell on the one hand they wouldnt have to alter their physics model in the slightestfacetiouson the other hand hello these arent colonial vipers the smallest ship you can find is probably the size of an a380 and none of the ships are particularly aerodynamic lets keep spaceships in space you might get away with a rifter or a condor but anything bigger than a destroyer would just plummet down to the ground and illuminate the planets surface
planetary flight looks to be a dumb gimmick which breaks the background fiction tritanium is supposed to be unstable in atmospheric conditions and serves no purpose except superficial eye candy its even less worthwhile than walking in stations which at least has some fringe appeal to the roleplay crowdthe only issue the csm should bring to ccps attention regarding planetary flight is to request that it be shelved before they dedicate any significant chunk of their resources to it
i also dont think the time is now but i do know that eve will go there in the future not from insider info just my intuition i too would like to hear what ccp has to say about the current state of this idea
as far as ships arent aerodynamic is concerned neither are star destroyersplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesnor is voyager terribly aerodynamicplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesbut crazy as it may seem science fiction makes way for some things being possible regardlessif you think planetary interaction is useless then youre probably not alone but there are others who think ambulation is useless too most of those folks who think any kind of nonpvp content is useless really just need to go play halo instead
just a request for ccp to tell us whats up with the project
a short paragraph in an item description is hardly rewriting ancient hieroglyphs inside ancient egyptian pyramids
killing local is a great idea but the reason we fight over 00 if memory serves me right is for the industrial value that the moons and minerals bring us  it used to be hard enough making the trip from the belts to the stations everytime a unknown would arive in the system this would only make that hard if not impossible for miners to stay safeunless ccp added some kind of long lasting scanners and a window  maby like a radar system for the miners to use drop a probe at each gate thatmay help keep them safe for a few hours a system only launchable from a mining barge even would work and then the miners in 00 would become a part of the eyes and ears of keeping systems guarded that information would not have to be of a tactical nature just a informative one ie friendly or unfriendly just arived time to run or stay and mine that simple information could then be given to any local defence force
three things1 make local a recent speakers channel then you have no idea who is actually in your area unless they are chatty which spies shouldnt be2 make hunter modules for tracking down nearby cloaks3 do not under any circumstances allow probes to find a cloak
i see a lot of honest opinions about attempting to equilize sp amounts and corp sizes but that wont solve inconsistancies industrialists will always have sp mainly in their industry skills while your warfighters and pirates will have theirs into mainly combat skills a persons ability to invent blueprints or refine crokite is not comparable to another persons ability to target catch and outrange an opponent in pvp battle because of this any effort to even the warfield based on sp should weigh heavilly on the combat skill sp and not on the noncombat skill spadditionally corporation sizes matter little as many corporations carry friends on the books who are out of game for various reasons people cancel accounts for a few months go for vacations head off to college get ill and even totally leave the game forever or die you also have differences in the mechanics of how corps function the industrial corp may have 3 characters per account on the corp payroll since alts can train to use the manufacturing equipment assist with production mine or haul resources run occasional missions etc the warfighting corp may only keep active fighters on the payroll since thats all they need existing off of mission rewards bounties and tribute corp membership numbers do not directly correlate to combatant capability the amount of time a character is ingame and sp in combat skills do

im pretty sure there were space whales in another space sim game called starglider or starglider 2 from years ago
space whales  gnosis
youre in space no sound can be heardall for the whales
woot
they use eve voiceor better yet give them bots that log into ts and ventthe same argument could be made that space whales cant surface for air anywhere these are space whales they sing with transmissionsif you would watch the space whales instead of trying to murder them all the time you could learn something about them

im not a colour blind but was one when my cat have gnawed red channel wire in monitor cable ui in that period was completly misunderstanding i lost a lot of valuable cargo and ships
yes yes yes amongst other things the bops needs this
good
ok so i havent seen anything new on this in a while and my useless widow is still sitting on market collecting dustwhat a surpriseplease give us an update on what and when its been far too long with no answer
yes please look at black ops
good to see that something good is coming out of this you have my support
agree to the need to rebalance black ops completely not simply adding fuel bayv
when i first joined eve as a scrub and read through the different races eagerly picking the one i wanted i was very surprised when i learnt within a few hours that effectively the race selection means nothing more than minmaxing attributes unless you enforced roleplay on yourself the ability to crosstrain into everything in eve including other racial ships is great for a sandbox game but its flawed for an mmo most players will simply cross train into areas of strength and ccp follows with the nerf bat instead of each faction being at war with one another and your options being limited to fight for your cause in your ships and each fleet balancing itself you end up with uber fleets as you say and that will never changeno matter how hard ccp tries to balance the ships and make people use more options in reality there will always be best fits for fleets and people will continue to find those best fits and bias their fitting toward them by having the doors open for everyone to train what they wish just allows them to do thiswhile i agree with your idea i think the root cause is even deeper and basically requires a wholesale change to the game
demus rationale is right it would limit the choices of many hardcore players but it would also strengthen the roleplaying element of the game and make for more balanced battles where blobs wouldnt be that important i like the idea but it requires a lot of planning ahead i never liked the powerplayer idea cause it leads you to fly not what you like to rp and somehow we have to take into account that this is a mmorpg but what is hot and trendy
i like makes eve more logical with people choosing races sticking together making fleets look likefleets and not like random throwawaysi wish the same would have been done with regions and manufacturing for example u make gallente ships 25 faster and 15 cheaper in gallente stations and gallente space and so on and so forth this idea is supposedly to difficult for ccp to handle their own statement was that it needed a complete rework around how stations workbsnice constructive post keep it up
this proposal is so crazy that it just might work
this
i like the ideas demus puts forward itll change a lot of stuff thats already considered normal for the game but i think it could work if done properly personally anything proposed to make minmatar bss not get laughed at gets a thumbs up in my book
it will work  i am not crazy i tell you i am not  i can prove it seriously now i was laughing myself when i was writing it up but honestly i cant see how it wouldnt work or make things better
well starting off i would like to point out the definition of sovereigntymeaning i am the one that makes the rules here not i make money herehave a shop or house hereso making sov related to killsefficiency would make a lot more stance than the current system of being only related to how many poses you havei dont see a good reason to have it being related to asteroid mining or ratting since these are usually done for just personal gain and not in groups or for corps at least in 00it should default to who has a pos therewhat would get interesting if you get a good efficiency percentage and you break their sov for a cynojammeralso having a cynojammer turn off for an hour or how ever much time after a dday is turned on could also be a nice additionps posting at 12am hope this makes senseakira117
its being worked upon so stay tuned
there is a confirmation popup window not for the victim of the attack but for the attacker he is after all the one who is going to die if he proceeds in high sec as posted by another above the pop ups can be disabled they can also be reactivated should you wish to do that after deactivating them its like switching the safety off on a gun if you dont have the safety on the gun could go off and hurt someonewindjammer
i agree
nonlinearizing territorial combat isnt a bad idea its also not an inherently good one current pos warfare is boring your solution would only make it more boring please tell me how your system would improve the game for current and prospective 00 alliances rather than npc 00empirebased raiding alliances if it wouldnt make life better for the people who seriously engage in sov warfare your solution doesnt fix the problemand if you want alliance activity to play a roll in sovereignty then require a real activity like that someone ratsminesmanufactures stuff in each system for x hours per day sitting on a gate hoping an enemy will show up to end your boredom isnt real activity its invented busywork and being able to muster up 10 ships to sit there isnt a measure of small gang prowess given the 24 hour timespan in which the attackers and defenders can revisit the gate its unlikely theyll ever bump into each other and if hostile ships do show up when defenders are nearby itll be reported in intel channels and the defenders will arrive with a lot more than 10 ships in either case youre hardly promoting small gang fights small gang fights are great but there wouldnt be any more of them under this proposal than there are now
have you ever been to 00nobody will split their force because the first one to do so will loosefleet a is opposing fleet b both are the same size the fc of fleet a foolishly decide to split his force in two to attack separate targets fleet a1 and fleet a2 fleet b stays together and obliterates first fleet a1 and then fleet a2 with trivial losses for fleet bpeople will not split forces unless absolutely forced to and theres nothing in your proposal that will do that all your suggestion is doing is giving us more structures to shoot hooray not
hey lookbob and goons are agreeing on something maybe that is a sign that the people in this thread who havent spent time in 00 have never had to grind round the clock to gain and keep space and dont actually defend territory should ask more questions jade seriously you proposing this and using your position to put it to the front of the csm agenda is rediculous if you were interested in chairing a body that actually put forward some reasonable ideas rooted in the reality of 00 youd contact the directors of various 00 existing bodies and get their input first this looks like it got hashed out on the star fraction forums and then rushed heredefending 00 shouldnt be tedious it should be difficult there is a difference
i disagree with the idea of giving sovereignty benefits on the basis of ratting mining or manufacturing alliances shouldnt be trying to outmine one another in order to win control of space exerting control over stargates is surely better than thatstargate control is intended as a reflection of an alliances open space dominance if you are capable of entering an area and holding a position on a stargate in the face of the enemy its a demonstration of military power the issue with pos construction as the only source of sovereignty benefits is exactly what is described a few posts above  territory control becomes a question of whether one alliance can build structures faster than another can tear them downin an isolated 24 hour period it may be unlikely that any two small gangs would clash but this conflict model should be viewed over the course of many days and weeks the alliance that is better able to deploy a consistent force across a constellation over the course of days and weeks is the one that will end up with control when two alliances try to do that over the same constellation they will inevitably come into conflictagain remember that it is not a requirement for a territory holding alliance to constantly camp gates  they will only need to deploy their small gang forces when an enemy alliance is making a play for their space and when that enemy alliance is consistently contesting stargates the defending alliance will need to field small gangs on a consistent basis to counter that and those small gangs will inevitably encounter each other over the long term
try to address this kelsinthe current large 00 powerblocks have invested trillions of isk into empire building the leaders of those alliances have invested untold hours organizing motivating and leading their members and often doing a tremendous amount of nofun tedious drudgery to get where they arebuilding a major sovholding alliance is no walk in the park for those who hold that status its been a multiyear climb against continuous difficult opposition every pos erected represents a missing day from a persons life spent doing something that is intrinsically unfun on top of hundreds of millions of isk expended each major empire has hundreds of pos deployed holding sov and thats only the beginning on top of that there has been the effort to design and construct jump bridge networks logistics schedules and systems deploy outposts construct capital fleets supercaps etceach 00 empire represents a tremendous investment of time effort and resources and because 00 space is not really intrinsically valuable the only real reward is to be able to say that youve done and are still doing it well that and the opportunities to fight huge off fleet fights with the biggest and most expensive ships in the gamenow explain why a gang of ten random people who have paid no dues and made no investment in empire building should be able to fly in from lowsec and even scratch the paint on a 00 empires sov on a lark if you can do that maybe some of the opposition to your ideas will die down thats what pretty much noone believes you understandserious business hurf blurf etc
youre still just saying the side with the most members and the best coverage will win well assuming both sides have equal tolerance for tedium and inactivityjust sitting there on a gate isnt a display of military power its a display of how easily amused your members are you want to display military power go and make something explode if youre just sitting still you are the opposite of a threat you are out of the game you are avoidable your firepower is not being applied against something someone might actually care about if you live in 00 you are generally either invading or being invaded or both at the same time someone will want your resources you will want someone elses there are not enough to go around never mind all the small gangs that run into alliance held space from empire just to  about you talk about it as though having hostiles in your space is a rare thingthe only real fights this will start will be between the power blocks and they will only fight in force you are in effect putting forward ideas that would make big alliances more dominant giving them whole new ways of steamrolling through small corps and yet it is members of those big alliances who are objecting to it perhaps you should think about that factand you still havent come up with a reason for why anyone would counter a bunch of small stationary groups with anything other than a blob
yea i kind of get what youre saying maybe add a little to the logistical effort in that they have to keep these stargates out in the middle of no where fueled up in order to operated and costs a little bit to jump through them dependant on say the mass of the ship being how much fuel it would take to launch  kg object xxx lightyears or something
i think that 00 needs more stuff to do ive never been there but it sounds pretty boring and desolate to me like going to some place in the african desert for one thing it sounds like theres absolutely nothing for rpers like myself to doi was thinking that there could be some kind of space pleasure house structure that an alliance could deploy in 00 refined ladies like myself could perch there entertain the the big imperial leaders with witty discussions about current events and psychosexual warfare and maybe our practiced hands could rub away some of the stress of all that tedious pos setup and logistics winkoh and the pleasure houses could generate income for the alliance that possesses them  just dump a steady stream of income into the old alliance wallet as long as theyre running how about that its kind of like an outpost but it can only be destroyed and not captured and you cant refit your ship or access the market there or anything well there would one particular black market you could access i think this would make 00 a more profitable civilized and pleasurable place to live

scratching the paint is very different than totaling the car i think that this proposal still very much rewards the kind of long term efforts the current 00 alliances have made to build their empires what it changes is creating a layer on top with more give and take than the rigid and linear pos warfare pos warfare continues to be the anchor for alliances  and maybe it is misleading that i have the stargates being the indicator of alliance sovereignty on the map i went back and forth over whether to keep that under the domain of pos or notthat is why i think its really ridiculous that many of the recent detractors in this thread have asserted that this somehow favors small empire based alliances over the current 00 sov holders if you really read the proposal theres nothing in it to indicate that the stargate capture mechanism simply allows for a certain amount of back and forth via small gang pvp that a system based entirely on pos does noti certainly dont intend to upend the existing powers with this proposal and nothing within it would lead to that the folks here claiming that would be the result are revealing more about their own prejudices than anything reflecting the actual content of the opwhat this does change is that it provides a suitable role for small groups of subcapitals to make an appropriate impact on the terrain of 00 an appropriate impact which is not a huge impact but also not a complete lack of impactoutposts supercaps capital fleets and pos infrastructure will continue to be vital to any serious development of a 00 empire and there is nothing within this proposal that contradicts that assertion in fact something that i think turned out really well with this is that it provides for a lot of flexibility in terms of how an alliance can affect the terrain around them using all those assetsi understand that the current pos warfare is viewed as nofun tedious drudgery and that is precisely what were looking to mitigate here by diversifying some of the pos sov benefits into other formsso again to say that this proposal somehow takes the grand and epic nature of 00 territory warfare and reduces it to 10 noobs conquering all of goon space by gatecamping them into submission is a poor willfully poor in some cases mischaracterization of what is actually in the op it just isnt solayers is the name of the game here and there is a place for a small scale pvp layer to go alongside the capital ship sieging and epic fleet fights it in no way replaces those it just distributes a few of the benefits onto some new systems in order to increase the fun and variety of the territory warfare process
wow the op presents such a dumb idea that i think im going to be canceling my account now star faction you win
except it isnt locking down a stargate 23 hrsday might be a demonstration of an attackers power but as long as its uncamped sometimes and defenders can go through an attacker having the gate camped even 12 hours straight per day would be effectively irrelevant to the defending alliance and given capitals ability to jump and titans ability to jumpbridge even having it locked down 23 hrsday would hardly be lifechangingit simply doesnt matter that a group of 10 or even 100 hostiles is sitting on your gate if theyre not shooting anyoneanything if small attacking gangs want to show their power why cant they kill the defending alliances ratters and miners and damage the defenders ability to make money slowly bleed defenders dry and challenge their ability to hold space indirectly through their wallets thats what small gangs excel at why do they need to excel at contesting sov directly tooyes the defenders would field gangs but they wouldnt be small gangs if 10 ships can kill the attackers 100 ships will kill them faster and with fewer losses nothing in your plan encourages small gang fightsi havent seen anyone saying that your proposal would change the face of 00 everyone whos in 00 now has demonstrated their ability to put up with the boredom of pos warfare theyd be able to put up with the boredom of your proposal too but we kind of like playing eve and actually fighting people and dont want to be bored to tears forced to perform meaningless tagthegate logistics rituals concocted by someone whos never experienced 00 sov warfare the way to make it less boring is to make it simpler and faster not more complicated and drawn outthe stargate portion of your proposal favors raiding npc 00empirebased alliances because theyre the only ones who wouldnt be bored to death by it conquering space will take even longer and be even more boring for attackers than it is currently defending space will require drawing straws to see who gets stuck with the equally boring job of retagging contested gates everydayi personally think activity is an interesting way to calculate system control if you dont like rattingminingmanufacturing pick something else that the defenders should be doing anyway in their space if defenders are legitimately nonactive in a system it makes sense theyd have less control there but being forced to camp gates when no hostiles are in sight isnt legitimate activity its a boring artificial pain in the asswe have fundamentally different experiencesinexperiences with conquerable 00 so were never going to agree ill go away now just please read through your proposal and imagine the most boring it could possibly be then imagine it being that boring for a month straight people in 00 are guaranteed to have that month of solid boredom 10x as frequently as the good fights youre hoping to encourage
thisthe op talks about adding layers but what we definitely dont need is more layers of tediousness and boredomit has already been demonstrated with station services that having more structures to shoot doesnt encourage fights it encourages blobbing because that way we can get the boring part over with fasterin short the ops suggestion is1 not adding anything to the game that isnt already there2 not adding anything that would encourage ship vs ship fighting3 adding more boredom in a game that needs less4 encouraging blobbing5 totally out of sync with what actually happens in 00
stargate control is about presence an alliance contesting a stargate is saying were here and we claim this space a defending alliance recapturing a gate is saying no we still occupy this spaceif you have a series of border systems that are being repeatedly contested it shows that another alliance is frequently bringing a sizeable gang into that spacebut what about thissuppose an additional benefit of a captured stargate is that you can set an 8 hour period each day during which it cannot be contested that way the system would be resistant to seeing opposing gangs miss each other entirely and an attacker wouldnt be able to contest during an defenders offpeak hours increasing the risk and likelihood of fightsi think that would solve many of the issues brought up
i prefer the change that i outlined here which accomplishes the goal you outlined but more effectivelyi dont think that the defender making its stargates invulnerable to one continent of players of its choosing is the answer a euro alliance shouldnt be able to force a us alliance to alarmclock just to start assaulting their sovin my suggestion the attacker can attack in his timezone and then the defender and attacker split the difference between their timezones for the deciding fight over who controls the gate that encourages fights and limits the effect of attacking outside of an opponents primetime and its about as fair as you can getits probably a good idea to use the workflow of pos assault wherever you can because 1 the players understand it and generally think its a fair system and 2 ccp came up with it and are likely to support its reuse theres no need to reinvent the wheel theres a reason that in the current game we cant set our pos to be invulnerable to one continent of playersedit an alternative would be to let the defender choose the time when a stargate leaves the contested state and can be claimed for one side again that would also mirror current tower stronting mechanics where the owner of the pos tries to time it so that an assaulter tower comes out of reinforced in his prime the gate would never be in the contested state for more than 24 hours
itll do precicely nothingnot diving too deeply into the fact that most smaller alliances has like 6 hours where they can field significant numbers youre also basically saying lets turn gates into pos we can shoot for very small benefitstheyll no more encourage small gang fights than anything else in the game for the simple fact that more  lessany revamp of 00 combat mechanics needs to encourage shiptoship fights and your mechanic doesntthe prevalent mindset and game mechanics will see something like this happen with your suggestionlets say the defender has like 40 people online whore prepared to participate in pvpa if the attacker got more people than the defender hell blob them together and take out the gates without the defender being able to do anything if he splits his force he may be able to do it quicker but risks lossesb if the attacker got less people than defender he not be able to stay for the time it requires to take down a gate unless both sides got 100 shipsc if they got more or less the same amount we may get a fight but we would get one anyway if they just roamed into the defenders area unless both are too scared to lose ships in an equal engagementin none of the cases has your mechanics made any change to anything this would happen too if the attackers went to attack a station serviceyou suggestion tries to emulate a capturetheflag situation in a fps game but you fail to take into account that the objective here isnt to capture the flag and win on points after 20 minutes the objective is to kill the opponents ships which contrary to a fps game doesnt respawn automatically or without effort nor do the game start from fresh after the 20 minutessince a blob is better at doing this than a small gang the blob will remainin essence your suggestion will not work because the preconceptions you base it on are wrong
ill go back and try to work something like this into it  youve made a strong argument in favor of using a reinforcementesque mechanic to ensure that ships meet in combat and going in this direction would allow the amount of time it takes to contest shorteri think your second suggestion of letting the defender simply set the time at which a gate will become available for capture should it become contested would be simplest and give the defender the best opportunity to field ships in defense of their holdings in theory attackers would contest a number of gates throughout an area and when their vulnerability times hit return to one or more of them to make a play to capture iti regret not having a way for fallow territory to return to neutral status though is there a way to bring that inps kerfira  i dont know where youre getting the shooting gates bit you may want to actually read the op
i think that in practice fallow territory would be so rare that i would leave it up to the devs so that they can code it whichever way is easiest im not sure that there has ever been a case where an attacker conquered a spaceholder and then left the space fallow at the very least some third party would show up and claim the space in short orderwhat i mean is that if its easier for them to leave out the bit of code that says hey this gate has been neutral for 6 hours who was the last defender ok that guy now has the gate in the captured state again then thats fine because i dont think that code would be executed very often at all
yeah thats fair enough  i agree that it would be unlikely for territory to be uncontested by anyone ive revised the details about how stargates are captured in the op to reflect your suggestions and i think itll work well let me know what you think
ya it looks translated correctlyi think you should also add to the proposal what i wrote earlier about requiring a resource expenditure and maybe a special midslot mod to perform the gatecontesting action analogous to how dreads go into siegeso now i think the proposal draws out sov warfare into a longer process kinda bad but adds something that small gangs and small ships can do kinda good and has some ideas to reduce the number of ships on grid for some parts of sov warfare good while leaving in a stage for huge off fleetfights with big expensive ships goodso it could be worse
out of curiosity are ccp allowed to step in and tell the csm that certain ideas are not worth discussion and that they should be stricken from the agendabecause this is one of them stop trying this has a 0 chance of success because it involves a empiredweller suggesting sweeping changes to a part of the game they have no experience in
and jade is right it is totally unreasonable to silence any opinion or proposal that is constructive if you have a better idea post it dont just sit here and knock down ideas you dont think have any merit simply based on where the player hangs out in game
then why exactly do they do it if its inherently unfun seems like if that was the case alliances wouldnt bother there must be something entertaining about it
ok its the same way that ten random iraqi insurgents can strike fear into the hearts of the most powerful military in the world with improvised homemade explosive devices
if possible id like to keep the preplanning component of the stargate capture part confined to forming a gang of sufficient size and consisting of members of an alliance  as i think that does serve as a light barrier for entry without adding in a whole new module or resource but ill put it as a parenthetical suggestion just to keep the idea in playone thing i do think would be interesting would be to allow hacking to play a role in stargates  perhaps hacking would allow a ship or ships to use the stargate without being recorded in the activation logs or allow someone to see what the failsafe timer is set to before they contest it
good job wasting csm time which could be spent on true improvements and fun trying to fulfill your corps and ceos shortcomings3 dispersion of forces yields better results than concentrated forces  include a mechanic that contains incentives to fight simultaneous battles on different grids or even different systems to reduce the needincentive for blobbing and encourage small scale pvpkelsin you have no clue what or how many ships are needed in current 00 warfare do you
lets return to the now altered opone single time zone alliance attacks another single but different time zone alliance during their prime time sending in small gangs to capture 510 of their stargates the gates come out of their reinforced mode in the defenders prime all at the same time there ensues a desperate rush to make something happen in a single 5 minute window because if you think people wont use whatever is necessary to do this  as quickly as possible youre wrong now this is the defenders prime he can probably fight off the entirety of the attackers available fleet without too much hassle at this point its quite possible that the total amount of ships his enemy can field now will be smaller than the amount he could send out to claim gates earlier they wont be stealing them all assuming at least one side actually wants to keep these gates one of two things happensthe defenders choose to split their fleet and try to reclaim all the gates the attackers dont in the knowledge their combined fleet in this time will mash any of the splinters they annihilate a small group and claim a stargate the rest are reclaimed but this is of no real consequence this entire affair has only taken about 30 minutes out of the day option two the defenders bunch a majority of their fleet definitely saving one or two specific stargates but potentially losing the rest the attackers either bunch and claim a single gate or spread to try and claim more than one if the attackers bunch they better hope the defenders dont know where theyre going if they spread the defenders not in the main fleet can form suicide or sniping teams who try and keep these gangs to under 10 people while the fleet moves around mopping up whatever happens once this is all over the gates have been claimed and the attackers have buggered off again the defenders in their prime reclaim those gates they lost and probably a few of the attackers for good measure the whole cycle then repeats in the attackers prime and each side trades a few stargates every day with no real gains or losses if the two alliance primes match youre doing nothing but adding a buffer to how pos warfare currently works the attacker finds out the timing of the enemy gates they arrive in system in force just before this time and lock it down they capture the gates wait a few minutes for the timer to kick in capture the gates again and then nuke the jammer if there is one its just a cynojammer attack with a 15 minute warning for the defendersif two big alliances fight theyll probably just stalemate cynojammer attacks will come with an extended warning gate capture gangs in unjammed systems can be easily countered by cynoscouts watching the gates as they come out and a titan online to bridge in a defence fleet the same method can be used to get capturers on any gate thats not being defended when youre invading then youll get claim spamming send out a few hundred pilots to claim every single gate in an enemys space that they can get at announce to the universe that you have done this and when the gates come out laugh as your enemy struggles to defend 50 gates simultaneously while you invade along with whoever else can find 9 friends and feels like travelling down from empire to stick the boot in to those terrible people in their big alliances of course if you try and avoid this by letting them time every stargate individually its insanely in the defenders favour just give yourself 10 minutes at each gate and you can rotate the fleet between them set four hours a day as prime and thats a good 25 gates you can defend without any major problemthis idea will do nothing other than make the already drawn out process of pos warfare take even longer

right and as the attackers knock out single stargates here and there they open the door for attacks on cynojammer arrays because the array invulnerability is lost when one of the stargates in that system is captured by the attacker and this moves the battle to fleets within individual systems which in turn opens the door for attacks on pos within systems that have their jammer arrays knocked outthat seems to work pretty well what are the flaws
idea was rejected in the csm meeting
oh dear that means star fraction will remain as irrelevant empirehugging wannabes
sanity prevailed
not gonna learn about 00 in crielere star fraction
no guys i participated in faction warfare i think i know a enough about 00 and these changes were neccesary
that was always going to happen even if this change had been voted in
the flaw is that the cynojammer would be better protected than it is now
all i see in this thread is the star fraction and empire corp wanting to get into 00 without having to do any work these ideas are awful and no one with any sanity or understanding of 00 should support it if you want to get into 00 then work for it like everyone else out here had to dont just change the game around to fit what you want and screw everyone else over
purest strain ownage
was rejected at the csm meeting there were some calls for a generalized change to sovereignty issue to be resubmitted but since we already did that first time round for the iceland agenda its probably time to drop the aspiration for formal csm submission i think its unlikely well see any significant proposed change to 00 warfare pass through the current composition of the csm i would encourage kelsin and other commentators to keep working on the proposal though and consider submitting it to ccp directly since it is a very good proposal and definitely deserves to be seen by the teams looking at 00 sovereignty sorry it failed chaps hopefully well have better luck in the future
first we need to come up with an agreement on what the problems with 00 even are if you actually lived in 00 you would understand that its not that simple and writing up even a list of problems that arent going to cause a ton of debate is a huge undertaking then we need the proposition to come from people who actually live in 00 incase you didnt notice this whole thing was shot down by a lot of people because i mean an empire corp telling us whats wrong with 00 youve got to be kidding
well thats an awfully negative way of looking at it youd think ccp would set up some method of receiving proposals such as this a council perhaps
ah well thanks for the input toman and to all who gave constructive criticism
it didnt fail because of the composition of the csm it failed because you couldnt get your coalition to show up for the meeting or alternatively because you put the issue on the agenda without making sure that your coalition would be present to support it if dierdra lavista and serenity had been present it probably would have passed hell dierdra voted to support on the first page of the thread basically it failed because you are inept and clumsy and do not know how to use your chairman powers to your advantageim glad that youve given up on putting forward proposals to revamp the system though because its a complete waste of time for anyone involved for the people who actually live in 00 to even reach a consensus on what the problems are would take weeks of work then weeks of additional work reaching a consensus on the solution and then the issue would have to be discussed with ccp then theyd have to discuss it internally and then the solutions would actually have to be developed tested and deployed all in all no results from the effort would probably be seen for over a year because ccp has plenty else going on besides this issue and by that time a new csm would have handed off an entirely different proposal and god only knows what else would happen in the game over that time lag could be solved for all we knowissues this big are nothing more than opportunities for fun theorycrafting and to build castles in the air by the time any visionary proposal issued by the csm can become reality there will be a better game out there to play anyway
np gave me something to do while waiting on my  to compile coming up with the proposal was more fun than playing the results of it would have been
to be honest the current csm is good at some things i think weve had some excellent small issues and such but i do get the sense we wont be able to come to consensus on any significant change to 00 sovereignty because it simply treads on too many toes and too many entrenched interests i didnt feel we had a very fruitful discussion today over these sovereignty changes because it was too much dogma and too little actual flexibility or objectivity i guess 00 sovereignty is one of those areas that ccp will need to look at independently of organized player feedback in the future and until then we can concentrate on smaller issues we can find common ground on end of the day the csm wasnt introduced to be the be all and end all of playerccp communication and if we find areas where we cannot function correctly then we should just be wise enough to leave well alone and get on with the stuff we can do well my 2cents anyways
can we impeach you
thats one of those things you werent very good at
the idea was bad it was a horrible horrible idea someone not agreeing with you or yours doesnt always insinuate dogmatic response or some grand conspiracy sometimes youre just wrong happens to the best of us simply because a discussion doesnt go your way does not mean its not fruitful i believe that there are ways we can look at the 00 issue holistically i just dont think the proposed solution was a good one a majority agreedthe solutions to the issues of 00 are not to change 00 into factional warfare or make it so that 15 dudes can take down the sov of thousands these solutions and the responses from some in the meeting greatly underestimate the amount of work and effort required to hold space today its been quite trivialized to be frank its no fault of the people doing so its just ignoranceill repeat it again because it bears worth repeating there is no entitlement to 00 it is not anyones right it takes a great deal of work and effort to take and hold space and most are simply not up to the task that is not a bad thing you already have factional warfare with control points in the game if that excites you nothing is stopping you from playing thereto be honest in the meetings weve had a lot of the talk about solutions to blobbing and multiple objectives exist today in many cases its simply  envy small gang work exists today and believe it or not gasp it happens every day in 00 eve is a sandbox and it is you who are limiting yourself not the mechanics theres a lot that could be changed but i think what bears looking into is what makes the barrier of entry into 00 so high hint its not stargate tag its logistics its management its leadership its will and effort two of those can be made easier and less painful via mechanics the other 3 are nobodys fault but your own
have you considered the possibility that the reason this was rejected was that the idea itself was horribleadding a layer of boredom on top of another layer of boredom isnt an improvement if your corpie is so brilliant why dont you have him think up something thatll encourage pvp instead of pve which is all structure shooting really is
thats one of those things that wasnt an option
on the silent majority part most players dont post and dont fly carrierswe cant know their opinions without them offering them up but we can analyze what is advantageous to their ingame experiencedeemphasizing the role of carriers as carrier support is advantageous to most players as it puts more emphasis on subcapital supporta lot of extremely loud players posted many many many times making it seem like most of eve was against itto achieve this you must make carriers less effective by themselvesthere are many many ideas about how to make carriers dependent on support but ccps original proposition is superior to all of them drone delegation dependence is the right idea and i think they should review their original ideai support the original fighter delegation idea for the following reasonsfighter delegation would be the sufficient weakness that carriers deserve if you take out the ships that the fighters are delegated to then the carrier is not as effective anymore but if you ignore the ships that the fighters are delegated to then the carrier is very effectivesimple elegant effective and makes perfect sense they should have done it but didntpeople will be unhappy about it after all there are thousands of carrier pilots but it is the right decision those players may throw a hissy fit about it but after they are done with that they might reexamine what they choose to fly into combat and choose an amount of carriers that is proportional to the size of the support fleet in which they must delegate drones tothe worst thing that they could happen is that these players go back to flying subcapital support which is a good thinghowever delegation should be made much easier and convenient than it currently isthe biggest complaint about that dev blog was that delegation is a logistical nightmare organizing who is delegating what to who when there are hundreds of people in gang i can see what they mean drone delegation should feel easy and naturalcarriers should be able to flag drones as being available for delegation to their fleet much like a sell order on the flip side fleet support should have easy access to requesting drone support much like a buy orderthis would allow a carrier to open up a window to view drone support requestsbuy orders and delegate dronessell to whoever requested themit would also allow a support ship to open up a window to view drone support offerssell orders and accept support of those drones from whoever offered themi believe it would be ideal if both the nerf and similar functionality to what i propose went in at the same timefinally ccp dont let players bully you into not making a decision that is good for the game while more and more characters get more and more sp eve will have more and more capital ship pilotsif you do not make the right decision now the situation will only get worse to where absolutely everyone opts to bring a carrier to a fleet as support rather than all of the other smaller support shipsif you delay making the right decision youll just  off more and more people that start to think of eve as capital ships online you had the balls to admit the mistake that you made with carriers now just find the balls to correct the mistake it is the right decision make it
i like banes ideas as a new player looking at carriers as a potential career in the longrun i felt they were just too bland and a bit boring more thought out mechanics and options available like he suggested would generally make them more fun and appealing i think
 bane glorious  goonswarm relies on new players  banes post 8 in this thread hardly anyone trains advanced drone interfacing to v let alone level iv banes post 10 in this threadplease consider removing some skill prerequisites such as jump drive operation v advanced spaceship command v and so onthe skill training time is boring and causes harmful stratification between newbies and veteranthe above quotes indicate banes impressions derived from goonswarm membership apparently he disagrees with you on the the number of new players goonswarm has he himself cant fly capitals and hes been in the game for over 2 years he feels hardly anybody in his alliance has maxed the skills and wants those skills eliminated and finally he wants to reduce the difference in ability between newbies and veteransthat can be added up to show a pretty clear picture of what bane hopes to gain and what he believes it will mean to goonswarmas an example of other alliances bob simply does not have the same demographic in point of fact one of the critcisms of bob was that they take only people with 34 million spclearly clearly an alliance such as bob would suffer disproportionately compared to goonswarm if banes wishes were to be granted goonswarms numbers would then have a greater effect than they do now against bob and similar allianceswindjammer
bane making leading statements in your first sentence means i stopped reading at the first sentencetry again without logical fallacies straight off okay
look above to post 98 for the bulk of my replybanes proposed nerfs would not affect other alliances in the same way it would goonswarm it quite simply has to do with goonswarms primary asset over 5000 members thats well over twice what anybody else has to pretend it has no bearing on issues is to ask everyone to stick their heads in the sand and pay no attention to that 600 pound gorilla behind the curtain look to 2 and 2a of what youve quoted me on to see one way in which this worksits not paranoia its paying attention to the situation and comparing that to what goonswarms representatives in the csm ask for and apparently ask for again when denied the first timewindjammer
damn straightregardswindjammer
goons suggesting people read threads before making terrible replys what is this world coming to
so tell us how many players should someone who subscribed in 03 be able to defeat on their own
because you have over twice as many members as bob and bring twice as many pilots to any given fight as bob banes proposed changes would enhance your advantage due to your numbers against the fewer and more skilled veterans of bobwindjammer
thank you you precisely underline make bold and italicize the summary of my posts as well as a considerable number of specific points in those posts your cooperation is most appreciatedbest regardswindjammer
i dont know almost seems like hypocrisywindjammer
very big of you to go out of your way to do so ive bothered to actually ask a number of the silent majority what they think about the proposed carrier nerfs the response that sucks runs into the 90th percentile try it yourself ohbut then i suppose they arent intelligent enough to make their own decisions and we require you to tell us all whats best for usyou cant have read the response threads to the original ccp zulupark dev blog because you got this exactly wrong the biggest complaint was about the proposal to force carrier pilots to delegate their fighters carrier pilots overwhelmingly desire to retain control of their fighters in deployment and wish to delegate fighters as an option not as a requirementyeah ccp dont listen to the players theyre wrong listen to and be bullied by letsdothis hes right thank goodness heshe is here to straighten everyone outdisgustedwindjammer
give capital repair arrays automatic activation on locked friendlies switching the activation to serverside where lag isnt an issuehave two sizes of fighters to both force carrier pilots to decide on large damage against large targets or small damage against small targets just like everyone else in the gameallow anticapital carriers to be fitted but at the expense of repair capabilitymake reppers smaller faster and require more slots so that a focused repping carrier has to use more slotsallow a repair oriented carrier to assign fighters in lieu on controlling them directlymake triage mode allow a carrier to perform industrial scale repairs to dreads or allow the carrier to remain mobile during triageat current fighters are too versatile the repper omnifit takes too few slots and not enough focus the capital damage dealer also requires too few slots a carrier that triages becomes vulnerable to capital fire but cannot actually perform capital support on the caps that are receiving cap firetriage is badly broken the amount of repair you can do in triage can only be useful for another cap look at the dps numbers a bs requiring triage hps is almost surely going to be alphad down on the first shot making any dps vs hps relationship moot its supposed to enable a carrier to be much more effective in its subcap support role but this actually just places it in line with dreadnoughts in the damage tanking arenathus if you want to do something in triage you simply make yourself have to tank dreadnought damage while being unable to give your industrial repairs to dreadnoughts who can use it and only able to repair nontriage carriers who dont need it simply put if youre in triage and not primary youre enhanced capabilities go to waste
yes because alliance membership count is directly proportional to the number of pilots that show up to fights this is why ascn is still the games dominant 00 powersarcasm aside youve clearly stated that veteran players should have an advantage no one really disagrees with that except in degree how many frigs should it take to kill a cruiser how many cruisers to kill a bs bs to kill a dreadplayer knowledgeskill skillpoints and numbers should all be involved in determining which side wins a fight so tell us where does that line get drawn because right now all your statements amount to nothing more than rediculous antigoon propaganda that even worse is based on numerous faulty assumptions
every carriers ship bay has the same size 1000000 m3battleship sizes range from 414000 m3 typhoon to 517500 m3 apocalypsesame is true for any smaller ship class but battleship sizes display this issue best as it is for example not possible to put two megathrons into any carriers ship bay but it is possible to fit two abaddons yes i fly megathrons while i admit it adds a certain flavor to the game having different ship sizes it also overcomplicates logistics i am not saying it makes it impossible because of course if i team up with a minnie pilot i can put one mega for me and one tempest for himher into my carrier but still overcomplicating thingshence i propose either adjust size of carrier ship bays probably a difficult balancing issue however could also lead to new carrier mods like ship bay expanders with certain drawbacks or equal ship sizes eg battleships 500000 m3 cruisers 100000m3 etcgood idea bad idea only my problem and i should crosstrain to another race

in my opinion hacs going 35kms isnt broken at all as they are easily killable however 10kms hacs etc are broken so i propose adding a new formula instead of the current nerf that prevents ships from reaching these stupid speeds using the following equationnew speedold speedmassold speed2451mass10000000000861014yes it looks complicated and is probably horribly inefficient but thats what i came up with eventually it only really affects the stupidly fast ships leaving normal nano hacs as a viable pvp option still though slightly weaker i feel it would be much better to start with a change like this the nerf scalple instead of the current plan the nerf sledgehammer this also doesnt damage webs and blaster shipsnew ship speeds with this equation addedold speed  new speedvaga  dual poly single nano2k  2k4k  35k6k  5k8k  58k10k  63k  this is the ships terminal velocity so it cannot go any faster than this speed with its current mass even if you have full faction and hg snakessac  dual poly dual nano2k  19k4k  35k6k  47k8k  55kcrow  single nano  ceptors arent affected much due to their low mass making them better nano counters and keeping their role of being fast5k  5k10k  9k15k  135k20k  17kthis graph shows these changes in more detail moving from crow at the top vaga sac and raven at the bottom the peak of the graph is the terminal velocity so the ship stops increasing in speed at this point the y axis is the new speed and the x axis is the old speed
okay so here we are with the hotly debated upcoming patch and of course there is much moaning going on on both sides and i just want to take this opportunity to say at firstthis is out of hand and needs adjustmentboth sides seem to be taking it to the extremes in this conflict with few able or willing to think constructively or meet halfway and personally i grow tired of ithaving said that and satisfied both my own personal smugness and irateness in one stroke i will try and address and offer ideas on what to me seem to be the most hotly debated critical issueson the nano nerfit seems to me that while a good toning down of the speed element is necessary and the csm has caused many pilots to rejoice as they have taken up the nerf bat and waved it in the general direction of ships exceeding 3 kms in regular speed one might wonder if all their manhandling of the speed tanks is justified or will result in balancethat webifiers are to be reduced in effectiveness is perhaps warranted but to do it in the same stroke with adding more penalties to already disadvantaged minmatar ships and to cut down on the power of overdrives that much when its the poor noobs one choice to squeeze more speed out of his ship one can understand some of the severity for the implants gang bonuses should perhaps even be reduced more but only velocitywise generally though it seems to me that they should have begun by increasing the stacking penalties instead or by limiting ships to using only one module of a certain type for example why would you need and how would you be able to fit two engine housings and two nanofiber internal structures its far from just the power items that are to blame its the weightreducing modules cumulative bonuses that were and still are the issue in the first place remember its called nanoing for a reason and this stems from the very next issueon microwarpdrives and speedi cannot say that i was anything but shocked and appalled to see that for all their intent to solve these issues of extremes appearing in eve the csm had almost overlooked the microwarpdrive it more than any other module or augmentation or game element because it has become so dominant as to be considered one is the very key to this problem i can come to no other conclusion no matter how i twist and turn the issue and in face of this i have proposed an alternative solution but even disregarding that keeping the massive bonuses to speed and equally massive penalties that the mwd represents cannot reasonably be seen as anything but a bad choice simply because they are extreme and thus quite obviously become accordingly hard to balance if this upcoming nerf does not offset things completely making nanofitted speedtanking ships obsolete then it may very well keep them right at the top of the game nevertheless its like an illbalanced seesaw if the weight isnt perfectly distributed it will always weigh over completely to one side in the end its a knifes edgeissue that shouldnt even be there in the first placein short reduce the effectiveness and penalties both of microwarpdrives or preferably have the module replaced by some more reasonable alternative dont take away all we have worked or skilltrained toward so abruptly and add some higher skill requirements for the usage of mwds or the equivalent this will keep them from being used quite so easily by expendable pilots using expendable ships in rather notorious tactics that can only be described as metagaming ic
on the missile problemthen of course there is the unavoidable issue of a lowering in overall speed drastically increasing the power of missile ships against ships relying on outrunning missiles and their explosions this is beside blobs largely the achilles heel of any modification to reduce the power of mwds but i would not have mentioned that former subject had i not a solution and really the fact is that seeing as there are already ships that have problems against missile boats that the drake has long been the target of outrage among many pilots and that defender missiles are seen largely as a waste of slots and ammo i think that this solution becomes rather necessary after a while if it is not alreadythe answer is introduce missilecountering ecmand how without offsetting the balance once again and keeping missile ships useful without having to implement too many new modules or skills or bonuses or even shipsafter some thought the answer seemed obvious and i took my inspiration from the recent addition to heavy interdictors warpdisrupting capabilities against capital shipsthe answer is to use existing ecm but to use scripts and turn their functions around in a manner that almost mirrors the interdictors modules these function alterations would disable the chosen ecm modules from targeting specific ships and of course drain capacitor and induce penalties but help defend against missiles andor possibly dronescaldari ecm jammers when mounted with these scripts and activated would use the ecm and ship sensors to detect incoming missiles and their electronics and jam them one by one causing the missiles to believe their target lost and to deactivate andor selfdestruct the penalty would be a targeting speed reduction because of the defensive system using up part of the ships sensors and computing resourcesgallente sensor dampeners would turn their own function on end and create a signal dispersion field around the user ship confusing the missiles sensors and causing them to detonate prematurely or off toward the side of the ship however because of this field reducing signal accuracy and resolution to the user ship itself its targeting range and that of any ship within 45 km would be penalizedamarr tracking disruptors would disrupt the missiles targeting causing them to track slowly and on anomalous signals offsetting their detonation much like the gallente variant however this disrupting field would similarly slightly disrupt the tracking of anything within 45 km friend or foe and interfere with the ships engines slowing it downminmatar target painters would send out a steady lowenergy signal to detect incoming projectiles and once it detected any it would lock on them and send out a concentrated version of its painter beam blinding and frying their sensors and systems causing their destruction this detection signal though would have the disadvantage of causing the user ship to see an increase in signaturethe balance would come from the fact that even these systems would not be perfect one would have to apply enough ship bonuses and module augmentations to ignore other forms of protection for them to completely stop a missile attack or perhaps so much as bring it down to tankable levels because the caldari and minmatar systems would have to deal with one missile at a time making volleys or fastfired missiles difficult to counter and the gallente and amarr systems would only offset the explosion thereby reducing the damage but not negating itwell that about wraps these first analyses and suggestions up hopefully there will be some form of support or consideration or at least anything other than whine in response to thismy regards to you all
proper linkyou had 1 to many
facepalmi am lose
not if they haul significantly less per trip which  guess what  they would nice try though
wrong without some restriction a carrier could hold about 120000 m3 3 itty5s expanded and rigged to 35000 m3 each or whatever it is when they were nerfed the smb was increased in size so in fact without limiting the role of haulers in the smb they could now be very effective at moving cargo without some other way of preventing that
now you do realise that a rorqual has an identical smb plus the ability to hold an additional 126000m3 of cargo right jump freighters go further holding three times as much as a logistics carrier even without restrictions carriers are still vastly less efficientedit the other way of preventing carrier logistics was the compression nerf which was committed at about the same time as the original smb nerf you really do need a vast carrying capacity to efficiently move minerals and other goods today and carriers simply arent a viable option because of the significantly increased fuel cost that multiple trips necessitates
why because its disingenuous i can tell you right now that the alliances that abuse nano tactics are getting every alt of every pilot to try and vote this down look some of the people up ingame noob corp much its not so much the eve community speaking as a childish minority who dont want to learn how to do anything other than fly nano
the carrier nerf got canceled is there any reason it shouldnt be the same for nanos
how dare you
against
why yes forum whining alt there is a reason things should not play out the same way herecarriers didnt need that much of a nerf nano ships at least hacs and recons do its quite simple
while i think this topic is pretty pointless ill play alonganother difference between this nerf and the carrier nerf prettymuch no one supported the carrier nerf except for 1 or 2 fanbois who like to blow smoke up ccps yawhile on the flipside about 12 of eves population supports a nanonerf even most of the posters in the antinerf thread say they want nanos changed just not this change
poast
yes because a dev blog that specifically says player input will be considered should ignore player input
and most of the people on the for topic are in noob corps too so whats your point sore loser

simple proposal  micro 25m3 drones that are one use only good for pilots with no missile skills and for ships with tiny drone bays
proposal let your jeenous ideas get hashed out in fi a bit firstdrones dont have fuel and drones can be extended to about 200km rangewhat youre suggesting is a weapon that will continue to follow the target no matter how fast or how far they fly until it lands a hitif you want missiles then train missiles if you are upset about small drone bays then get a bigger shipthis message brought to you by a guy who loves using his drones but wont stand for half baked ideas floating about
i believe theyre called missiles if you want to use missiles without training missile skills well i really dont know what to say to you
voting yes faster bcscommands ftw
voting against considering what ships were dealing with here and the speeds of missiles come on you cant seriously think that ceptors completely outrunning anything even other ceptors and a battleship going that fast is reasonable
whats sad is that this guy has been around since february 2005 youd have thought that hed have gotten the message by nowim halftempted to get an alt corp together and have a standing war dec up on his corporation void engineers just to see what the reaction is
poasting in a can i have your stuff thread
sukio is no longer associated with voidsukio was a trial recruit and he refused to fleet up for pvp although the entirety of his corporation engaged the enemy due to numerous inconsistencies with his cover story he had been stripped of roles for almost a week and was kept in the dark on fleet operations to prevent espionage as far as enjoyment of the game is concerned he was well protected if war targets logged on they were announced with ample time to dock up sukio it is time to grow a pair man up or gtfo of eve onlinethanks for your timev
looking at sukios employment record is like looking at a a shopping list of corps who sukio must have had bad experences in pvp with this guygal needs to stay in the npc corps permanently eve does have an alternative to war decs npc corps stop complaining when people who have balls enough to push away from the npc corp umbrella have occasional encounters with war decs its part of the game you seem to want all the benefits that a memberrun corp provide but dont seem to have a clue that freedom isnt free cheers to void  great call in booting this peace activist
bullsht ccp will eventually see the light and serve the majority of its player base by requiring the decced corp to consent to the wardec then the majority of the eve subscribers can get back to the business of missioning mining and production which the game should have been centered around while the small minority of the mentally unstable players can just act like dks to each other
you guys are really pathetic really
710 your name sort of gives the game away though
why you violence boat
okay got heard at the csm and we voted it through will be on the agenda for formal discussion with ccp chatlog of the meeting  here

i know this isnt the angle the op was taking but heres the reason im supporting turning titans into mobile stationsa titan is the ship you graduate to when youve pretty much done everything else the players who pilot titans would probably like them to be something special and uniquenobody who started playing eve that long ago started because they wanted a way to be king of the mountain with everything else in eve you can only maintain what you continuously build erosion is constant the feeling of entropy is what makes eve seem very free you are free to do whatever you can accomplish and the game works very hard against the desire to maintain something without working very hard to keep itat current a titan is a tool for players most advanced in the game to seriously upset the essential entropy and dynamic of the eve universe its a tool that allows a group of the most advanced players in the game to escape what would be their fate at the hands of a much larger group of less advanced playerswhat if instead a titan were a tool for an advanced player to lead a group of 300 pilots from losec to try for their fortune in 00 what if titans were the central pillar of a nomadic lifestyle in space where your ability to be where you are depends on your ability to defend that pillar would you as an advanced player enjoy the experience of affording that opportunity
cringesand this thread was doing so well what with the death star references invoking images of darth vader and destroying planets and mon calamari cruisersand then you had to come along trying to incite the parental instincts of the pirates you do realize who youre talking to rightyou cant appeal to their sense of humanity you cant encourage mentorship or taking those less fortunate players under their wing and you most certainly cant expect them to provide a means for anyone to advance unless in doing so it should benefit the pirate as welli came to eve thinking it would be something open ended as well i thought that some players might entertain themselves with mining and production while others might venture out to the deepest reaches and battle one another for control of the galaxyand then i played a while and i discovered that those bloodthirsty and vindictive players who werent hugged enough as children amuse themselves by tormenting everyone within reach they flip the miners not realizing that they wouldnt have ships modules or ammo if it werent for the fruits of the miners labor they sacrifice the cheapest ships they can muster to destroy haulers who made the mistake of thinking high security means secure and about those deepest reaches well they just camp the entryway and loiter day and night waiting for a sucker to snipeso no i dont think youll encourage much compassion from titan pilots because they have come looking to be king of the mountain and they have done so in bringing as many titans to a fight as they can dont bring a knife to a gun fight has in very little time by comparison become dont bring a gun to a doomsday weapon fightwhat the supporters of this thread are asking for isnt a mechanic through which the far too wealthy alliances can help raise a new generation of pilotswhat were asking for is to set the record straight to put titans back in their rightful place as a support craft and perhaps with a devastating weapon but not one that is simply spammed repeatedly until one side is completely wiped from the mapwhether those players intended on being the cutthroat sanguineous sociopaths they have grown to be is irrelevant the matter at hand is the fact that a nuke in every household needs to be stopped titans have become too costly and too destructive and its only sensible that people would move to put a stop to them
if you want to make titans fleet support craft make it so that they dont do lethal damage to ships but make it easy to deploy a titan on grid with your support forcesif you nerfed the damage amount to 50k with max titan skills any bs with a dc ii and a lseplate could tank it as well as some bcs the dd would not become a weapon to kill ships but rather weaken many of them as well as kill off support and drones i think there is a 10 second delay on dd activation but it should be upped to 15 so all support have a good chance to warp out this would make it so that a dd would no longer eliminate a fleet but rather force support off grid and the remaining battleships retreat or get popped in short orderto allow the dd to be used with its fleet on grid make it a targetable weapon the titan would target a ship in the enemy fleet or a star gate and fire it causing the origin to be around the ship it targetedthe one downside of this system is that titans would always be protected by their support fleet in this fleet giving them ample time to warp out while support ships were being killed and would probably make titans even more unkillable
huge emphatic yes doomsdays deter so many real fights its just tragicxttzs suggestions are also worth strong consideration
1 titans were meant to be the flagship of the armada take a look at the empyrean age banner a single titan on each side but lately the tactic is to deploy a dozen at once i think theyre already easy to deploy2 nerfing the damage is one approach making the attack directional is another as for the delay i think its a bit closer to an hour between shots however when you bring 12 titans and chain one after another theres no more limitation3 one thought circulating was to make the dd a focused weapon while the titan is in ship mode and then allow the aoe once it went into station mode4 fleets should be protecting their titans and not the other way around titans should be a massive support craft not sent in droves to clear the fieldif one were so inclined as to take a few of the suggestions floating abouta titan jumps in and immediately the fleet starts receiving gang boosts the largest and most painful opposing ship is identified and a giant angry blast streaks across space to take it out picture the death star then the titan retreats a bit or not and starts to take up roots little doors blinking lights all sorts of pretty premium animation insert spaceballs movie reference and the ship has become a mobile stationnow the fleet is able to retreat within the shields of the titan thats not to say that it has billions worth of shields to protect them but they do have a moment to repair before the fleet overwhelms the protection once the shields go down then the fleet is open to attack once again before the last bit of shields fails the titan releases a giant wave of energy to assault the surrounding fleet not enough to kill everyone but those who survive still feel the stinghowever that also means that the titan is down to armor as wellthe opposing fleet sends in af and hac which use their tactical sensors to locate the soft spots on the underbelly of the titan and with a barrage of fire the titans high slot functions are disabled no more dd beam and no more gang boosts the fleet pressed their defense as the wounded titan jumps for safetyehh
i feel you i feel youbut just hear me out does  cheney perform more acts of evil as a shotgun wielding old man with bad aim or as vice president of the united statesin all honesty if you want to be a menace single handedly youre almost no more than a brat in a game with no rules brats just dont have to worry about insurance and security standingsim aware of the play style and sensibilities of the eve community but to really take it over the top you need an army of minions and you need them to be as effective as you can make themdarth vadar was cool but emperor palpatine was f unbelievable compared to his apprentice one wields a lightsaber the other wielded armies upon armies of stormtroopers and darth vadarso you see to be all you can be even as a pirate amongst pirates you need a tool for corralling and unleashing an army of pirates
i support changing stuff that sucks
ofc it will ffs the point is currently titans are not that big a problem what is worrying is they are being built a lot faster than killed and so its gonna be routine to see 20 titan fleets in the top 5 entities in eve you really want to see 5  10 capitals 1 shotted per 5 or 10 minutes a 100 man capital fleet would be decimated in under an hourthink
i personally think that the jump gate noise is the best part of eve please make jump gate noise appear randomly and louder and more ofteni am sure it would bring much joy to people and even some other whining would cease
yeah like that giant beam that fires off make it actually fly through space and randomly collide with ships and stations and stuff and they instantly get vaporized zap troz pew boom narf kerpowey
making it so in order to be good at the game you have to give up your daytime job sounds like a great ideahow about increasing the taxes when you change an order then you have to actually think about order placements instead of just blindly undercutting the next guy by 001 isk
while at times i have been frustrated by the 001isk game overall i think it should stay the way it is it is a harsh place we live in and this adds to the harshnessthe only thing that might make even a bit of sense is increasing the broker fees a bit when you modify an order and even that i am not so sure of
there is no such thing as market pvp there are 2 kind of players the i have a lot of spare time and i am doing the 001 isk game kind and the i have deep pockets and i am gonna mess up your market kind now like all the cool kids they needed an interesting cool name for those activities and they called it market pvp cause if it has pvp in it its uberliciousand yes i am one of the later kind
i believe such environments would be a meaningful addition to the game it might also be a tool that could limit blobs some
perhaps i did twist your words and i suppose it was a little immature i have no desire to waste energy on a pointless internet argument and marcus gideon is a big boy so ill just apologise hereim sorrymoving onwhile seeing all the jita alts squirm as huge numbers of ion storms come crashing down on them would be hugely entertaining when observed from a distance if you actually needed to go to jita theyd become a real painthe reason im concerned about this is that if a feature is introduced whose primary purpose is to annoy people or if it only seems that way then the forums will be swamped with people demanding its removal the devs end up wasting time that could have been spent more productivelyas before this topic has my tentative support
please yes
i support this
at least let the anchoring skill mean something other than requiring it at 5 before you can use starbase defense modules
agreed
whoops  ah yes there is an existing thread
so ive been thinking about all the things that i dislike about eve and have somethings to say lets starton titansso i was thinking about the advantage of titans in cynojammed systems guarding cynojammers if used properly the cynojammer should be basically unkillable so i came up with 4 ideas 2 of which is elegant the other 2 of which suck1 make a ship that suicides into supercapitals and does massive damage sucks2 make a ship that absorbs all damage delt from and to a specific area like a shield sucks3 give afs an ability that disables supercapital systemselegant4 make it so titans cant doomsday in cynojammed systems profoundon posesposes suck and are soul destroying there are already topics on thison sovright now the way sov is done is uniform and well the worst part of eve so ive thought of some ways to make it more interesting1 change sovereignty so it isnt always based off of poses for example make it so some systems you have to do something like attack a complex or find a beacon in a system through exploration hell or even play some sort of hard core capture the flag in order to get sovereignty to switch over not very well thought out2 make it so there are more resources that can be exploited in systems throughout 00 and lowsec that arent at moons that people can fight over not complexes or exploration complexes because those are inherently flawed due to server reset timesif sovereignty is changed and the focus moves a little further from poses it will make the pos problem betteron nanosno matter what i say itll make me sound like a troll which isnt my intention so ill say this i would have preferred ccp to have fixed lag and their physics engine than to fix nanos to work within their limited parametersdiscuss flame me whatever anymore ideas would be awesome or ideally disagree and come up with better alternatives
fantastic forum selection for your thread
there is no rp mechanic to support this proposition it makes sense that the guns shoot your drones it is the most efficient way for the sentry guns to neutralise threats and make sense that shooting drones is in the guns programming ig and irl
im not sure this should be the case all the time the only reason solo exploration is even possible at least in 00 is with alliancelevel infrastructure or a large time investment i dont think its been proven that that tradeoff is unreasonablethere really isnt a ship that provides all the roles that mining requires shotting rocks and hauling without again some level of infrastructure or a larger time investmentit took me like 3 minutes to come up with a way to cram a probe launcher on to all the ships i would even think of bringing into a 00 site ie raven and dominix although as this thread has taught me i have no idea what people consider to be a viable exploration combat ship seriously a pilgrim
this is where the misconceptions on exploration come in00 exploration is not at all the same as lowsec and high sec explorationive ratted 05 multibattlecruiser sites in a 100 t1 fit caracal before with 4 launchers and a codebreaker in a midslotive ratted triple angel bs spawn belts in a pilgrim with no guns and with a codebreaker and analyzer in the mids though this probably isnt possible in deadspacethe point is that its not just group content or solo content its both just like missions just like mining and missions didnt have it anywhere near as inconvenient as exploration but mission runners got their marauders so they dont even have to go pick up their salvage boats im happy for them i know how frustrating it can bebut share the love
i sympathize but thats a pretty tall orderdear internet spaceship guys please fix the human race they are jerksthanks
zylawy has my nod and tip of hatand since its somewhat of a good idea this thread deserves more attention so up you gopersonally id like to tone and add or remove lightswindows in places tone the engine exhausts somewhat though of course you should only be able to vary the colors within a range since they are of different tech and all that and simply vary paintjobs preferably through a tool and not just by importing textures make it a little friendlier for playersi really like the idea of a matte black and rustcolored and damagedlooking ship with filthy dark orange thrusters and just a few irate glaring red windows and lights prowling belts and lanes searching for prey
i want to discuss lag caused by missiles and dronesmissiles you can target them you can blow them up with defenders you can blow them up with smartbombs and they possibly have to recheck their math to determine if they hit or notwhat kind of lag does this cause in large battles what kind of effect do these things have on server performance and packet sizes do we need missiles to be this complicated do we even want missiles to be this complicateddrones most ships that use drones spit out 5 of them im wondering the same thing as with missiles but i believe i already know the answer ive witnessed fights with many carriers ive seen how much worse the lag is between normal fights and fights with carriers and moms spitting out ridiculous amounts of dronesso is it necessary to have 5 separate objects deployed for 1 weapon system if 1 drone were the equivalent of 5 in terms of hp and damage would this not be an acceptable compromise for the sake of performancein the special case of carriers and moms instead of additional drones to deploy youd have huge drone hp and damage bonusesi just dont see why its necessary to deploy 51015 drones i know they cause lag why not just simplify the damn things for the sake of performancethis has been posted before many times but sporadically in threads not focusing on performance mostly its been talked about in threads about nerfing carriers and suchso i just want to discuss the concerns about how drones and missiles effect performance for a change
i am not going to reiterate too much of the post that i made above so im just going to say that to me it seems that only the polycarbs need reining in and a few stacking penalties added or adjusted the implants should be left alone why because its not the fits or rigs that are the real problem the microwarps aretake away the mwds enormous speed factor andor try to sync up ship tracking and missile speeds and explosion velocities certain frigates and interceptors should be able to outrun standard missiles a few cruisers be able to outrun cruise missiles etcetera but the extremes of speed that are right now need to be cut clipped and balanced out
of course we read it its subject to change based on player input why do you think players are doing so much inputting
it would be really nice if you guys would bring up the problems with minmatar battleships capitals and the problems with projectiles in generalat least artillery in one of those open slots
i eat babies they are tastyno really check this  out i am really really really trying to be constructive here before you people go and start knocking the walls down
your link is extremely broken
i propose that the behavior of csm members be brought up at this meeting arrogance and outright personal attacks should not be acceptable from someone in the csm especially someone that chairs the program the csm has already lost the faith of many and something needs to be done to even remotely start building up a reputation as something useful and worth paying attention tothe first step would be to take action and swiftly kick the guilty parties rear out the doorevidence that there is a problem can be found here multiple pages of trash from jade constantine
years ago before parliament was televised live sometimes id tune into it live on radio the insults name calling stupid noises and the utter lack of respect to the speakers was unbelievable at times and im sorry to say it but it seems the csm is like this the majority of the time or it certainly comes across this waybasicly until the elected behave with more decorum and profesionalism the majority of the eve subscribers will have very little faith in the csm possibly this is why only a small percentage of the subscribers didnt vote in the first place because they didnt want to be bothered with all the pettiness they knew would follow unfortunately it looks as if they are right which is a big shame because i feel this wascould have been a step in the right direction
this is the thread where ruleofbone and the ex veto guys suggested that the current csm be disbanded and replaced with an unelected group of verone rells eddz and some guy with glasses from eve tv to ensure that ruleofbone would have the dark and dangerous eve he wanted then when some people called him on how stupid that idea was the veto guys started crying about the standards of elected officials actually having the poor taste to come and say that a stupid idea was a stupid ideashort answer is no if you want an issue on the csm agenda make an issue and get a csm to support it no support for rules shortcutting of democratic decisionmaking here
wow youre twisty mctwistingtonits nothing like that its a thread where you dismiss peoples opinions because theyre not players theyre whiners and therefore not worthy of your golden stare
and you start the personal insults here as wellif you happened to actually you know read anyones replies instead of just assuming things and making an ass out of yourself you would realize two things noone ever once insulted you until you started the ing match and even then the insults were nothing in comparison to the trash you were provoking others with and two nowhere did anyone once say that they themselves should be put in the place of the csm if i recall half the people in that thread believe the csm is a farce and wouldnt want to participate anyways nice try thoughbut the simple fact remains if you truly believe in the csm and what it stands for you should do the best thing for it and remove yourself you lose supporters every day with your pathetic behavior and you are driving the csm into the ground and considering how most people think the csm is a farce in the first place you shouldnt be treating what little supporters you have that way in the first place i cant speak for anyone else but after reading countless threads i can only assume i am not alone in saying i will never support the csm as anything until you are gone from it jade

while i appreciate you using your corp forums to host the chatlogs can we please go abck to serenity posting them on the evecsm site even a link to the jf threads so i can find them more easily would be appreciated as for the vote people care about i find it rather disappointing no decision was made if you dont say something now you really wont have a chance in two weeks let alone two months
serenity is on holiday at the moment so there wont be any evecsmcom updates for a bit sorry its inconvenient but its the only option i can think for posting them at the moment i know i was very disappointed as well i felt it was a big missed opportunity and a real shame
can you ask ccp where the missing items are and when they will be introduced stuff like codebreaker ii micro aux core ii etcalso when are pos towers and mods going to be upgraded to t2
i understand that the ideas out forward in this post are to bring the divide in cap ship balance closer for shield and armour tankinghowever introducing a new set of implants with shield amount is totally unfaesable given the prevalance of the passive shield tank on other shipsa drake already has no problems passively tanking 1000 dps imagine the strength of that passive tank with 50 shieldsso although this idea may be good for capitals thought needs to be put in to how the changes would affect other ship typesclasses
could we get a 2nd class of decryptor that decreases lab time for example to run a cruiser invention job takes 2 dayswhat i think the game needs is a decryptor that decreases lab time by 25 50 75 and 100 so u can run jobs faster
1 post this in features  ideas or assembly hall  jpsc is for discussions about csm processes not for specific ideas 2 thats a terrible idea
as many others before you your greed will get the best of you ccp rome has fallen
i agree they should be at least as fast as their tech 1 counterparts its stupid that they arent every single hac is faster than their tech 1 counterparts but afs are still all slower than tech 1 frigates it isnt right imo seriously if afs were nothing more than normal frigates with better resists a couple extra slots a little more gridcpushieldarmor and an extra damage bonus theyd be finethey dont need any silly roles just be a superior frigate
ill pretty much speak my opinion outright the ships are fine overall apart from the frequent whine it seems like the community would perhaps like a few more hulls or the ability to customize and individualize details decals or color schemes that is the feedback that i have gotten over the last few monthsit is when it comes to game elements that things need balancing most specifically speed the overwhelming emphasis on ship type the fantastic speeds attainable with the modifications present the sheer induction of redundancy to certain ship types or strategies as far as i have been able to deduce all have more or less to do with the abnormal levels of velocity attainable by ships in eve today its gone far enough that its past strategy it has made speed such an element that extreme emphasis is put on it and has removed a great many tactics and a great deal of thinking and cleverness from the game and there is a single certain something at the root of thisassault frigates are overlooked cruisers go at 45 kms past the level where the eve interface remains practical not to mention many ships turning radius many cruisers are seen as ineffectual missile ships are hotly debated and depending on the situation either helpless or your only salvation heavy assault ships other than those capable of clocking extreme velocities are disregarded as useless whymicrowarpdrivesthe nano issue is slowly being addressed but it will not be enough and yet it will be too much when you take minmatar and blaster ships into account one cannot ignore that for all the problems caused by that it is in spite of their penalties microwarpdrives that offer the last and largest factor of speed that has caused these extremes to arisecut the efficiency of microwarpdrives to just below twice as powerful as afterburners and much of the signature penalty with it but not the capacitor penalty and increase missile velocities until only frigates and interceptors can outrun standard missiles and few cruisers have a chance of outrunning cruise missiles or if this simply makes microwarpdrives themselves overlooked have them removed from the game entirelyspeed is the issue it has come to overshadow everything else eliminating or hamstringing vital game elements and it is time that it is toned down but it needs to be done the right way and with the right and real problem in mindin addition here is my proposed alternative solution
this is an awesome idea
full support here idea is awesomei think ccp need to look at restricting how the pos could be used and what for so as not to make outposts redundant but it looks awesome as a conceptid like to see more about it tbh
hot damn that was quite a presentation i hope to see all this implemented in the near future
oh yeah this get a thumbs up
fully supporting this let me have just extra space on the second screen not a span mode with the ship right in the middle between left and right monitor
supported
but meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehi dont have amazing shield skills if they make the nid shield tanker it will add a whole slew of skills i need to train i still support a boost but there has got to be a better way
bump
i can imagine the boredom that establishing a fully loaded and operational pos must inflict im toying with the notion of a simple research pos and it sounds like it might suckbut you do realize that youre erecting an entire space station and once it is placed then you are allowing the nuclear reactor at the core to power up and begin supplying the various factories and warehouses attachedi could possibly see a slight reduction but making an entire station spring to life in the same amount of time it takes to convince your secure trash can not to go anywhere is a bit rediculousperhaps if the whole dead horse or whatever it is idea were implemented where you could actually see the station slowly coming together piece by piece then you would understand the necessity for the lengthy build timelittle builder drones flitting back and forth slowly assembling the station rather than just pieces floating and eventually a light turns from green to red
i dont think ive seen this many consecutive supports in a thread before topic has my full support

this i am extremely disappointed in the csm reps who voted to put this off and are potentially going to do nothing about this issuethe entire point of the csm wasis to bring the ideasconcerns of the player base to the ccp devs there are now several thousand votes both for and against telling you to do just that you then turn around and vote directly to not do your job all i can say is wtfthe general consensus of the council was that it is too early to saydo anything about this absolute bullocksfact the against vote poll is winning by more than 2 to 1 at the time of this typing and has been ever since it was posteddoes this give the csm any sort of a clue as to the majority feelings of the player base concerned by this issuesome people claim that the vote has been scewed with alts towards the against but cant the for people use alts too or are they just more honest by nature than the against people fact read any 20 pages hell read any 10 pages of the against poll and the general consensus becomes so obvious that a preschooler could sort it out most people is both the for and against poll when considered as a whole agree that a change is needed to speed but specifically in the against poll many point out that the devs are going way to far and considering too many changes to very basic game play elementsam i totally insane or is this or is this not more than enough information to do your jobs and go to ccp with the idea that they need to at the very least severely reduce the scope of the changes they are consideringbottom line to those reps who voted for moving forward with this issue thank you for keeping the faith with your constituents to those reps who voted directly not to do your jobs shame on you and good luck getting my vote for reelection
against 1 perhaps a nerf to vessels going ludicrous speeds stacking penalties maybe 2 dont touch mwds and webs3 boost abs and afs4 leave masses of ships alone5 keep new scram module although it may need some tweakingthis patch kills tactics the game will be broken simply to address issues with ships that are a billion if not billions to fly and are not close to as common as these nuking changes suggest simply adding certain stacking penalties would prevent people from going ludicrously fast hit and run tactics should include other ships besides frigates there are already ships especially with the new scram mod that are effective at taking down ludicrous fast ships anyway and their cost is a mere fraction of the cost of the superfast ship you are also really killing the role of blasterboats that need the speed reconsespecially the huginnrapier as its role is a frig killer the vaga would be silly now as well i think if these changes are enacted we will see more nerfs to attempt to correct the imbalancesinadequacies spawned by these changes nerfing launchers next then people will gripe about sniping meanwhile the gangstactics you will see will be very one dimensional compared to what existed before tons of frigsome ecm ships with sniping bss or just simply mass blobs at the gates many hacs and recons are rendered broken a megathron blaster boat will be screwed also quite a slap in the face to someone that has invested a hell of a lot of training for mindlinks money given to you i might add only to have the speed bonus stack such that any ship that is fast wont get much of a benefit same can be said of snake implants and if you rely on both you are synergetically screwed there is nothing wrong with cruisers being able to go from 25  5 kms without spending a billion isk these speeds are very reasonable to be able to counter against if you feel you need to nerf webs so much you should give a web effectiveness bonus to those ships in which webbing was its role not just a maurader are you kidding

very dissapointed in the csm  you are considering your own opinions on the subject over the input generated by the procon the votepoll i tought your mission was to voice the feeling of the community not your own against  pro nerf  21 i think its clear you seem to think that we all just vote procon without trying it out on sisi well you are wrong i think there are plenty of posts with concrete evidence that this nerf is bad and will eliminate a certain type of warfare as it is no longer a viable option with the proposed changesccp seems to think that all nano pilots use hg snakes and use t2 polys on i think they can find out if they wanted to on how many pilots acutally use this types of mods and implants in actual combat but im convinced it will be a minorty the typical nano pilot is using t1 polys t2 nanos and overdrives and maybe a low cost speed mod implant this is what should be looked into that the typical setup by most nano pilots remains a viable option not nerf everything that the ridicilous stuff that most cant offord remains a half baked solutiongo do your job csm  the vote tells you exactly what you should do 
againstmwd being switched off when scrambled  this will kill all nanoships because when you want to kill the target you put your warp disruptor on him this means he can put warp disruptor back on you so this nerf will affect every engagement where the target is not jammed why mwd was created in the first placedecrease in web strength  you want to nerf nanoships so you want to nerf ships that counter them my logic is lost there you do that and then well see how you will let nanohac going full speed under mwd stop and still be within your web range you might think about rapiers being overpowered  then think about falcon isnt it overpowered as well then why not nerf all the ships to the point of where all the ships in game will have the same characteristics because its somehow fairby making overdrives and nanofibers stack youll do no harm to vagas and rapiers they usually fit only overdrives but youll nerf ships like curse zealot and ishtar which usually fit mixture of overdrives and nanofibers 3 overdrives 2 nanofibers for ishtar so that the minmatar ships will be even more superior in speed and this will create even more disballancealmost every single patch ccp nerfs something  why not improve something that counters the stuff that you want to nerfps arazu used to be a great ship ask how many people fly them now please dont make the same to the rest of the ships in eve where an uber ship will be something like navy issue osprey

against current proposal for  i dont get why just one or two of these changes couldnt rebalance everything make scrams shut off mwds which gives gallente recons a role and nerf the polycarbs back in to line with every other rig out therewhoah suddenly fixes the nano and does wonders for the speed problemorjust nerf the stacking penalties but leave everything else as it isbut doing that on top of nerfing the hell out of pretty much everything that gives speed is just over the topas a fix

i didnt read the whole thread so it may be posted alreadybesides a skill queue and dual training id rather like to see a mechanism such as train skill from level 1 till level 5 nonstopalso i dont think forcing players to log in after each level of a skill is completed encourages players to actually play the game more often
this please skills should be stackable up to 24 hours is passed imo this way if you log in at a similar time each day you have the best chance of being available to switchyou should be able to stack as many skills and with a total duration of forever with the proviso that when 24 hours has been passed you can no longer add to the queue so the last one you add could be a really long one but the ones before it on the queue are all small
i agree on the dual training thing2 skills training at half speeds
hell yes how hard can it be to code
i vote yes please put them back please 30s atleast
i like the ideas increasingly larger hull classes should be about increasing dps and physical tank capabilities let the newer pilots in smaller ships have some viability in a fightand having a use for those damnable afterburners would be greatsupport

i would like to see local go its gamey its out of character and it is generally abused in a way it was not designed forhowever you do understand that players are also humans real life humans most of the time one just wants to jump through 5 systems to go from station to station to pick something up it doesnt necessarily mean heshe undocks in order to have the adventure of their lives and generally people most of the time dont have the time to have the time of their liveslocal should be replaced by something that is more in character and that gives certain concrete advantages when flying through your alliances space i do agree it cant be completely safe but owning space does lose some of its meaning when there is no way of flying through it in relative safety maybe a pos module you can anchor with sov 1 and provides a number doesnt have to be names of friendlies hostiles and neutrals in the system to your overview it wont be out of character since the module supposedly could scan the system every 30 seconds to get ship signatures or something if one is flying in uncontested space well thats always something of an adventure anywaylocal could be kept as a chat where only the name of someone talking shows but there is no list with portraits on the right side of itit also has to be an automatic warning system its no fun loosing a warpin because you had to roll a cigarette
well that would make mining a dead profession atleast ratters jump from belt to belt to kill new spawns
you have to read the whole thing replacing current local you would have an alarm functionality on scanner almost assured there will be specialized ships or modules for this when you really need it sitting in one spot mining you can always put people on the gates always scan a system you enter to mine

make it so that when corp a wardecs corp b 1 random player from corp b has a navigational systems malfunction and overload and his ship and pod blow up right away
whats wrong with paytogrief this is eve for christs sakeits all about bullying the weak beating them up taking their stuff and making them movenoah and matt need to go to another game if they think socalled griefing isnt an intrisic and essential part of eve if there is a genuine issue about harassment of new players thats for the gms to deal with otherwise anything goesbreaking your opponents spirit is more important than blowing up their ships the existing war mechanics serve admirably in doing so thats how its supposed to bei am now concerned about eves future if this is what we have to look forward to dont go down this road ccp
corp a wardecs corp b the 24 hour waiting period begins immediately corp b can advertise their war responsibility in a manner similar to the current contract system globally searchable once advertised any other corp can make an offer to take on the war responsibility of corp b in the form of isk required and timeframe in which their offer must be accepted corp b then reviews the offers from the third party corporations and chooses the most attractive offer in this case corp c and pays the fee required by corp c once corp cs offer has been accepted by corp b the war is flagged as mutual and a 24 hour notification period commences at the end of that 24 hour period concord shifts the war from being between corp a and corp b to being between corp a and corp c the war can then be terminated as a mutual war might normally be terminated from that point onto deter corporations from creating shell corporations to sink all their wardecs corp b has to pay a filing fee to concord equal to the fee corp a initially paid for the wardec simply to post their war responsibility in the first place before any offers can be made by potential corp cs furthermore the costs of filing a wardec would be changed as follows the current base price for wardecs would be multipled by the ratio of members in the attacking corporation to the defending corporation with that sum added to an arbitrary bribe fee corp a can choose to pay to make the possible filing fee for corp b more expensive this fee would then be paid weekly adjusted for the fluctuation in corp members over that period plus the variable bribe fee paid by corp amutual wars would not be subject to cost multiplication according to the ratio of corporation members but would still be subject to bribe fees  potentially from both sidesany corporation belonging to an alliance would be immune to war dec individually though the alliance could obviously have war declared against them under this system the base cost for declaring war against an alliance would be equivalent to declaring war against a corporation the current system of higher war dec costs would not be needed as in declaring war against an alliance youre declaring war against all of its members  with the larger multiplier already making it a less attractive war dec targetunder this system large corps declaring on small corps would pay a larger fee to declare war and the smaller corp would have to pay a similarly large fee to put their war responsibility up for sale and make it go away smaller corps declaring war on larger corps pay smaller fees in general but are more inexpensive to auction off to mercenaries willing to take on the wardec this makes sense as between two companies the one with the larger resources should realistically have an easier time getting their way within the bureaucracy the corporation declaring war is given a means of making the war unattractive to sell off but at a cost similarly the defending corporation is given a means to avoid the war but also at a cost
well yes this is eve which is why they generally try to prevent pure griefing eve is a game of industry war conquest politics piracy griefing is what ruins a game not builds it up though much of this discussion is going over ways to be able to strike back at griefers stopping them from hiding from their own war which increases pvp and ccp really wants to go down that roadthe existing war mechanic is broken or at least it is not used for its intended purpose very much thus it should probably be fixedthe control tower idea sounds really great gives a nice juicy target to the defenders and it drops griefing while makes real wars more interesting
wth happened to eve not looking like a cold hard place but being one there is a way of grouping together without forming a cooperation its called a chat channel i hate the idea of npc corps as it is and now your going to extend itmany many players will remember the first corp they were in that was war decced for many its the first taste of pvp that they ever had it gives a corp scope direction and pulls a unit together sometimes it breaks them thats evei wholeheartedly disagree with the idea that a corp should be able to organize and build without becoming a target there are plenty of ways to avoid war decs all of them well knowni am honestly very angry about this
the trouble with this is you could never fight outnumbered how would a 15 man hit and run corp designed to take down logistics and disrupt operations stop the 1500 man alliance they just war decced rolling a fleet in and shutting them down
any game with infinite lives and magical infinite farmable resources is not a cold hard placetrue some of these ideas fall into the category of pointlessly safe but others give some real consequences to the aggressor which is something eve tends to lackoutside that the system has needed rebalancing for years 2mweek that used to be a big number but just isnt anymore
true but it still gives them more of a chance to fight back then they have now at the moment there is little risk in starting a war esp if you dont really have an incorp logistics wingthough i think the place this would really help would be things like small pirate corps deccing industrial heavy corps since a few pirates in cruisers can cripple industrial ops for weeks with very little risk since the can just fly in disrupt then dock with the control tower that industrial corp could hire mercs or go fit themselves and go after an actual targeti guess a better way of putting it right now the aggressors have a target but the defenders do not a tower evens that out a bit
1 alliances can have more than 1 commander center2 you can upgrade the idea with this rule the corporation that lost the command center have 72 hours to pay and make another command center this will make very difficult to actually shut down a very big corporation but hit hard the griefers that make corp just for griefalso an alliance do not need to declare war to fight in 00 so i personally do not see the problemi have put down the general idea i know for first that if oyu look for anyd etail it have to be changed but the general idea is clearly the only one that will solve the problem here
fully support this idea in my view local is completely unrealistic and the games single most used exploit it has the effect of strongly favoring some playstyles while making others unplayable that would otherwise be perfectly viable it goes against eves very nature as a realistic combat and economy simulatorthat said i also think local could be retained in its current form in high sec like others have pointed out that would be way more realistic while allowing for even more playstyle diversity than eliminating local altogether wouldhow abouthigh sec local works like it does today everywherelow sec local has no autodiscovery however constellation channel doesdeep space neither local nor constellation have autodiscovery

didnt read through all the replys but i belive a stock market is not a possibility unless ccp is ready to punish people for fraud without that a stock market will always be some half assed attempt just to look nice and wont really produce any good tbhmaby you could make some special rules around corporations that list their corp into the stock market to prevent people from scamming stock market needs investors and they wont come unless they can not only trust the corp but also know that if he trys to run off with the isk he will be dealt withi know ccp wont punish people for scamming and i support that however a stock market cant work without a little bit of law
until eve can handle a rights issue with shares then going any further is rather pointless
this is much more in line with what i believe a stock market in eve should look like i would support something along these lines
the difference from eve and enron is that the goverment deals with companys that go bankrupt and puts the people responsible behind barsunless theres something to prevent people from walking away with isk that they got for shares i dont belive there can be a succesful stock exchange however if ccp would be willing to monitor this and deal with stock fraud differently than the regular scammers there might be a chance
i posted that in another thread and tough it would be better here maybe ong time lurker 1st time poster casual gamer yada yada here s for the backgroundnow i was reading one of the numerous minmatar tread and as usualalways the arty subject then i had an epiphany a mental sound picture of what i d like arty to beblam blam blam blamthen the sound of silence  rince repeat how about keeping the clip size the same and increase the rof and by increase i mean like faster than acthat would make some kind of huge salvo giving back some alpha strikelike capacity i don t mean real alpha strike but if the 10 round clip is emptied in something like 20 sec it s almost an alpha nothe small clip keeping the dps in check because of reloadwouln t that give some potential for hit and run to the matari andjust think of the beautifull sound razzthat said i plaid guilty of not having run any numbersso am i the only nutter that would like the idea edited for clarity and to better explain myself and yes maybe i should have posted in the other threadsthe length of it scared me
we dont need to revise or boost the space artillery because its pretty ridiculous to start withi propose switching artillery for an alternative more plausible weapons system useful for hitandrun strikes basically one where the bullets are coated with compressed waste slag from the ships reactor upon impact and explosion superheated nuclear slag is scattered across the enemy ships hull causing a great load of residual damage over timethis sort of slag cannon weapon would still retain the powerful single strike of artillery but introduce a strong plausible reason for executing single strikes and then drawing back to keep from taking damage

rigs are great the concept of permanent ship implants to specialise your vessel as well as introducing a new market in salvage and doing away with the daft old loot can system is very good but rigs have had their problems where they stacked up with functions that were already modified by skills modules gang bonuses and boosters they had a tendency to go too far and doubly so where the stat in question is not stacking penalised for example trimarks armor hp core defence field purgers shield hp and inevitably polycarbons mass the passive tanking and nano crazes were directly related to the introduction of rigs note for the hard of thinking this thread isnt about nano not pro not anti not relatedanother problem is that people tend to gravitate towards the same rigs cccs polycarbons trimarks core purgers these probably account for the vast majority of rigs fit today thats not specialisation people thats more identikitcookiecutter ship fitting which isnt true to the original concept or funby contrast loads of rigs go unused  weep for the hyperspatial velocity optimiser 20 warp speed the powergrid subroutine maximiser i think this reduces rcu cpu need super helpful the targeting systems stabiliser  decloaking sensor recalibration time and the engine thermal shielding mwdab cycle time oh and every single drone rig this is doubly sad because these do things that no module gang bonus booster and either 1 or 0 skills do and thus are cool and different how do we solve this its as easy as 12345 i know this is two harder than 123 and also doesnt rhyme sorry1 balance rigs with similar function so that specialised is better than generalisedso what is a good rig and what is a bad rig a bad rig surely is anything that stacks up too much of a main statistic such that its infinitely more useful than most other rigs a good rig is one that specialises your ship into a niche making it win versus the same ship with no rigs or even the same ship with bad rigs in that same situation example capacitorbad rigs ccc raw cap rechargesmc cap amountgood rigsremote repair augmentor  remote armor rep cap usedynamic fuel valve  mwdab cap usewarp core optimiser  warping cap needsignal disruption amplifier  ecmburst cap needegress port maximiser  neutraliser and energy transfer cap needenergyhybrid discharge elutriation hybridlaser cap needcore defence capacitor safeguard  shield booster cap needwhy would i fit the vast majority of the second list when i could fit a ccc and have the best cap for all purposes thats not specialisation folks incidentally i do use one of those rigs the amazing remote repair augmentor this is because it gives enough of a bonus on a 23xrr bs that it by far eclipses the use of a ccc in comparison that is cool specialised and useful of course im not saying we should delete cccsmc  after all some ships need cap for lots of things and there would be unholy whining if they were removed but they should be among the worst choices for cap because theyre the most generalised the opposite of the aim of rigs instead boost the bonus on all the underused rigs above possibly with the exception of rr aug and egress port maximiser as they do get used the less useful a statistic and thus underused the rig the more it should get theres no reason why all rigs should be 1520 for example the warp core optimiser  you can never have so little cap you cant warp just not very far why not have the wco remove ie 100 bonus the warp cap need thus its not massively useful in all pvp but on a specialised ship eg a passive drake that only needs cap to warp or a bomber that has crap warp cap need adds a unique ability
a great example in the original design of this is cpu there is no cpu rig but there are several that reduce cpu need for certain modules if only they didnt suck then theyd actually be quite used boost them overall number 1 would brings rigs closer towards their original design spec and promote many of the rarer rigs it also goes a step towards preventing rigs making ship setups unbalanced  because the rigs that have caused the problems are the general ones trimarks polys cccs2 boost the underused rigs that do cool and unusual functionsseveral rigs do things that is almost nothing to do with the others but is cool nonetheless they also tend to be totally useless i again bring up the hyperspatial velocity optimiser and the targeting systems stabiliser these would be awesome if only anyone who wasnt mad ever fit one on a combat setup ever the hvo is useless because the vast majority of all but the longest warps is accelerating up and down from max warp speed and that is not a rate but a flat time the same on all ships its boring and makes increasing your top warp speed a little useless i suggest that the hvo be either 80150 warp speed or that it gives 40 to warp speed and acceleration time maybe thatd be worth it on any ship you intend to travel in or to promote guerilla warfare now that polys arent  all the tss gives a weeny 1s recalibration on a bs with an improved cloak a pathetic 05s on your recalibration in a recon or covops and of course a massive zero seconds on black ops and bombers you know the cloaking ships that are meant to actually decloak and combat stuffif it was either 8090 recalibration or it affected both recal and the cloaks scan res penalty say 40 to both then it would be very useful but only situationally in a niche and couldnt really be overpowered number 2 is overall obvious make the crap rigs cool theres no reason to be 1525 on all just because thats not balance3 drone rigs penalty has to changewhile  base cpu sounds nice for rp after all drones are robots and you could bog down your computer with programs controlling them its actually making them utterly unused because the bonuses are all minor balanced nice but overall just not worth breaking very nice fits especially on cpu tight boats like the ishtar or ishkur even the mighty dominix with excellent cpu rarely fits anything other than maybe a sentry damage augmentor on those moderately rare sentry ii fits seeing as there is no all drone damage rig and quite rightly so too generalist theres no reason to have such a tough penalty i suggest either  hull hp would affect gallente but not drastically or  agility4 add new rigs that follow the rules weve already established niche specialised dont stack up with existing stuff to huge modifiers and are cool and unusual in function an example of a good rig here is the projectile ambit extension  it was the first time we could modify falloff on a ships guns lets do more of that here is a list of ingame statistics that could without causing huge balance issues be made into rigs none of them have an associated module or nonship skill bonusdrone capacity no longer a dps increase now we have bandwidthturretlauncher ammunition capacitycloak velocity modifierturret signature resolutionmining laser rangemining laser cap usebomb launcher cycle timebomb hptractor beam rangespeedmax locked targetsew module falloffoh and for the love of god add a rig that increases damptd optimal why not specialise your curse to td snipers

that wont be enough im afraid theyll need more changes to make them a viable optionhonestly whats the point of a tech ii ship that will always die to its tech i counterpart the iskusability ratio is completely out of balance here the prenerfed status ccp released this ships its one of the worst jokes in this game so far sadly not the worst one but coming closei support more changes to the black ops from the list proposed by the community
i know i am in the extreme minority in my opinion perhaps the sole person with my opinion but i see no reason why the black ops class should not be able to use the covert ops cloaking device when the two ships below it in class cantalk about being so paranoid about a class that you prenerf it to hellit makes no realistic sense in roleplayingit makes no sense in practicality either they are far weaker and with lower damage potential than most of their tech 1 counterpats so whats the problemi know i know everyone wants each and every ship to have its own roll and ccp will blindly and moronically nerf its way to this goal even if the servers themselves were on fire whatever i just think its beyond stupid that a covert ops and a recon can use a covert ops cloak but the black ops cantjust drop all of this jumping nonsense from the class make their damage potential a tad weaker and give them covert ops cloak oh and make them not cost 650900m a pop meh no one is going to do anything about this anywayat the very least black ops need lots of loveflame suit on
yes please boost them im training up the covert line of ships at the moment currently training for force recons andid like for black ops to be useful by the time i get one
ccp like introducing prenerfed ships into the game unfortunatly they forget to unnerf them for years the speed nerf hardly helps with theyre bonus to cloaked speed plz take a second look at these ships
back ops are missing 2 arms and 2 legs these fixs is like giving them a single thighbone upto the kneenone of them make much difference in pvp because the whole black ops concept is flawed yes its better than nother but please for goodness sake actualyl try to fly these things in pvppeople logoffcloakwarp toa aligned spot when they see a hostile in local so you wont have time to warp a black ops in to the belt and lock the damm target unless the target is a noob that would die to a carcarel
i would be simply ecstatic if they could use covert ops cloaks or if they would split them into combat black ops and force black ops maybe the force black ops are can use covert ops cloaks and are immune to cyno jammers and combat black ops are a more viable pvp ship with more offense but without the ability to use covert op cloaks meh even if they give it a little love it would have to be something special to get me into it and i love my reconfj
i agree with the op 00 cloaking ravens are the scourge of eve they can rat all day with next to 0 risk local in 00 should be removed at all times unless you are next to a jump gate after all jump gates should know how many people are in system and who they are
always support these in principle
let me think about it no
you are incredibly delusional if you think this is true effective blindness gives a huge advantage to whoever is the most mobile this is almost never going to be someone doing pve you can negate some of that advantage by seeing them on scan soon enough but in that situation the pve guy has to be scanning constantly whereas the hac gang that just jumped in system has to scan maybe twiceyoud need to replace local with some other passive detection method or buff 00 money making enough that its worth either bringing a gang or losing ships a lot to keep ratting or mining viable
i strongly support this most especially in low sec00 realism should be paramount in eve as it is basically an advanced combateconomy simulator the free systemwide errorfree and instantaneous scanner that is local is completely unrealistic and eliminates a number of strategy and career options that would otherwise be viableas a reasonable compromise maybe local should be retained in its current form only in high sec it would make sense for concord and the sovereign empires to keep tabs on everyone entering and exiting their high sec system and making this information publicly availablelocal is the games biggest and most used exploit as any covert ops pilot knows
local needs to be moved to region should also only display personnel who talk in region chat which after a while they disappear much like aliance chat
1 minute delay entry into local chatproblem solved if you cant find someone in that time you shouldnt be afforded the luxury you also shouldnt be afforded free intelcouple this with an auto updating scanner as many cycles as server can process
yes indeed
there should be limitations to the ability to detect incoming targets to remove the local channel completely may be rather drastic but if thats what it takes id rather make it so that the communicationdetection range is limited cloaked ships shouldnt show up on either scanners or in channel of coursethe idea has my support though
local needs to be replaced with some kind of alternative intelligence tool but then im in favour in general termspersonally i like to see the local member list removed and instead give everyone a scanner window showing ships in system detectedevery n seconds each player gets an x chance of detecting any active hull in system once detected the hull appears as unknown on the scanner listevery n seconds you also have a y chance to identify the hull size frigatecrusierbscap and a z chance to identify the pilot namex y and z are affected by your sensor strength and the other ships sig size any pilot can hail the system at any time doing so reveals your name and ship size to everyone in systemany ship coming onto the same grid as you or the same grid as a scan probe you own would also immeadiately reveal ship size and pilot namewith a tool like this in its place id support removal of local member lists
agree to the need to remove local channel the way it works make ppl there seen only if they chatv
ing crazy but it might actually work i like it
an interesting idea it would see more use of ships that are rarely used now and increase the variety of strategies that would need to be developed to use and counter these new faction oriented fleets players with cross training in multiple factions would still be more versatile and able to better participate in different types of fleets though what happens if you have one of each factions fleets working together each fleet effectively a wing of a larger fleet commanded by one fc over an a channel specifically set up for that fleet everything becomes unbalanced once againi support further dicussion of this very interesting idea
why the hell not if we can have musical instruments in eve dont see why we cant see bonuses for single race fleets support
hell this isnt nearly as insane as the speedagility nerf in its current form on sisisure go for it ill support itof course i am one to bring back racial bonuses anyway waaaaaay back when when my characters were still barely flying tier 1 battleships at best each character got some form of bonus to that characters races ships andor weapon systems this got dropped in early 2005 i never really understood why but that is kinda along the lines you are talking about kindabut yeah support heck its way better than what ccp has come up with and its better than the csm who voted to dosay nothing about the speed nerf at this time
i could perhaps see this being implemented but youd need to be really careful how you did it my first inclination is to add racial warfare links or racial flagships or something of the sort all of these bonuses would be prorated to how much of the fleet is of the appropriate race  so the amarrian ships in a 50 amarr fleet will get half the bonuses that the amarrian ships in a 100 amarr fleet do the problem i see is that youd just force people to start 4 fleets and coordinate on ventrilo instead of forming 1 fleet but theyll still all be in the same spot im not at all convinced theres a way around that as such i dont think i can support this proposal interesting though it may be
agreed you would have to do it via a command module meaning a fleet with four races would need four command ships for the full bonus perhaps this could be used as a way of making the titan a more balanced shipprovisos aside i am for this idea simply because visually storyline wise and logistically it all makes sensethere is a risk howeverwithout great balancing one of the races may be far better than the others and this could lead to eve becoming very centered around a race
the idea of racial bonuses benefiting racial ships i like i think it would be cool if this worked for command ships that specialize in their races navy doctrineamarr  armored  skirmishminmatar  skirmish  seigecaldari  seige  informationgallente  information  armoredpossible mechanic op agree1 nerf general effectiveness of warfare links status quo not much but a little maybe 1020 to encourage specialization just a little bit dont freak out2 all ships get 50 to links when flying a ship that gets warfare link bonuses that are in accordance with navy doctrine2 command ships and capitals get 100 to the effectiveness of their racialspecific links maybe bc as well according to navy doctrinescenariosmixed fleet  100 of the bonusracial ships  150 of the bonusracial fc  200 of the bonusracial fleet  300 of the bonusimportant  leave the regular skills untouched modules should be effected by racial engineering superiority but bonuses based upon ig fleet commander leadership dexterity should not be
see my post and check if it fixes that problem you would have to have 4 pilots that all have the leadership skills to fit the warfare links and whatnot maybe make the fc bonus only on command ships and supercaps to force the players to have an awesome leader or maybe actually introduce the skill race navy doctrine that enables these bonuses on certain ships instead of making it a ship role bonus examplecaldari navy doctrine 20 effectivness of siege and information warfare links fitted on caldari commandships motherships and titansbesides this would still work in a fleet with racial wings and why shouldnt it it still needs very high leadership roles and only benefits the appropriate shipsedit can the op rename this thread to something more relevant and on topic
good stuff ill look forward to it
i made a proposal for this a while agothe basics are simple every activity in a system or constellation i would move to constellation based sovereignty instead of system based to spread fights out more gives you points per type of activity there is a max number of points per day lets go with the following activitiespos mining moonmining ratting pvp for each of these 5 activities you set a max amount of points that can be gained per day say 10 points per actvity so 50 points in totalthen you have to determine the amount of points a specific part of that gains say a large pos gains you 2 points a day a medium pos 1 point a small pos 05 points mining x amount of ore 1 point collecting x amount of bounty also 1 point destroying ships also say 01 per battleship 05 per carrierdread etc etcthen of course other alliances doing these kinds of things to you means losing points if they blow up your carrier you lose 05 points that day if they setup a large pos you lose 2 points of sovereignty a daynow what you finally need is a natural attrition rate say 1 per day that means that if an alliance collects 50 points of sov a day they lose 1 of their total so a new alliance occupies a systemconstellation day 1 they gain 50 points day two they lose 05 points due to natural attrition and gain 50 more points total 995 points day 3 they lose 095 points and gain another 50 etc etc over the longterm that means that an alliance using these figures as an example can build up 5000 sovereignty points because at that point natural attrition of 1 equals the max buildup of 50 points 10 per activity per daythis proposal would seriously shrink the size of alliance space and also restrict the use of jumpportals to areas actually used by said alliance balancing them a bit in my opinion it would also allow for small gangs to start affecting sovereignty in the long run if they keep harassing an areafinally it makes it much less attractive for an alliance to go to war at the other end of the galaxy with everything they have because that would immediately start to eat away at their sovereignty if they stopped mining and ratting enough to keep up the 10 points per day max for those activities might help a tad to reduce the size of blobs
this was my previous post on the issue otellus is me a bit more elaborated
key pointwhatever solution you think is best you need a system to force the defenders to well defendjust now its too easy to pos spam since a single dyso reaction moon brings in enough isk to put up a new pos almost every day people are defending by having hardner pos in the past before cynojammers people attacked by using hardner possso most imporant thing  find a way to force defenders to defend insted of useing npc structures to delay attackers
me coughcough points at hamstersthe barrier of entry into 00 is not the problem it is the 00 warfare itself it is slow it is static everyone is bored if it comes to poswarfare i didnt like most of the ops proposals because it slows down evecombat even more we dont need more forced on mechanics to capture space we need tools in our sandbox to spice up 00 warfare again stuff which adds more tactical depths than lagnolag
do you have an example stuff is a bit hard to quantify
windjammer if you cant be respectful to people that disagree with you dont expect any in return
that depends how many noob ships can fit on grid and still leave room for a cyno and a titanfrom a corpless alt by the name of letsdothis i dont think he did before
as you well know there are no firm numbers to this situation it is dependent upon more than the relative age of the veteran and new player different players train skills differently ships are set up differently racial ships have different upsides and downsides etc however all things being equal i believe that the current situation is satisfactoryas things are now set up eve rewards those who have put years into character developement while at the same time providing a future for those willing put in the same dedication only when two sides have approximately the same skill level and tactical expertise should the number of pilots be the deciding factor in a conflictthank you this gave me a smile it never ceases to amaze me that the single greatest concentration of outrageous propaganda in eve goonswarm still has the unmitigated temerity to accuse others of what they themselves do in such volume best defense is an offense ehi suppose in the strictest technical sense what i say about goonswarm could be construed as propaganda propaganda is the dispensing of ideas to an audience or community as such propaganda may be true or it may be false the ideas i forward are not based upon false assumptions they are based upon observations and i report them accurately worse for goonswarm these observations can easily be duplicated and verified by anyone who cares to look at them i often post the means by which this can be done but anyone can figure it out for themselves if they wish this can be done even more easily by a member of goonswarm but then corporate pride and comraderie get in the way of that process so perhaps it isnt surprising when a goonswarmer responds as they dowindjammer

based on what youre posting with a character that is less than a year old and which has never left the noobcorp i strongly doubt the windjammer character has ever flown in or next to a capital ship much less fought one why should anyone take your opinion on balancing capships into account incidently bane should be largely disqualified from making any suggestions about capships on these grounds as well and many of us have told him as much privately alreadyif you have actual experiences with capship fights than by all means post with your main but until then youre nothing but an antigoon troll with no constuctive input to provide
without anything concrete i think you should abstain from doing anything with this at all
the windjammer character was created for the sole purpose of posting in these forums it has never trained a skill or flown anything other than a shuttle or been in more than three stations this was done to protect my anonymity and that of those i associate with my posts are my own and do not represent the desires of any corporation in eve were i to show my affiliations i would be restricted in what i could say in that anyone who posts showing their corp is giving a representation of that corp regardless of any disclaimers they may issueall this is unlikely to change and certainly not because you or anyone else regardless of their corp affiliation attempt to bait me in your case you simply dont have the skill set to do so effectively dont feel bad very few people in this world doironically bane is one of the few in goonswarm whom i respect hes by far your best choice in representation on any issue though sometimes i get the feeling he reads a thesaurus on a regular basis to come up with some of the words he uses he has an excellent vocabulary is obviously intelligent and is not easily reduced to vulgarity insults and name calling i often wonder how he was mislead into being a part of goonswarm seriously instead of critcizing bane you should get down on your knees in gratitude he bothers to represent you i know he has a lot better things to doagain i refer you to the above regarding the windjammer character providing you with details of my capital ship experience would lead to discovery of my identity and serve no purpose if you cant read what i post and see the experience it hardly matters if you know what the specific experience isi note the elanmorin characters are only two years old one year isnt enough to post but two years makes you an expert your assessment of my reasons for posting is self serving and transparent in intent suffice it to say im not trollingwindjammer
why would i beleive someone who cant even figure out how to tank a hulk against a mindless suicide attack has the expereience you claim
windjammer if you cant be respectful to people that disagree with you dont expect any in return
1 i have not listed my experience in capital ships for the reasons i gave in post 116 of this thread take another look at the second paragraph from the bottom the statement also assumes an adequate level of competency on the part of the suicide ganker2 i dont really care if you believe anything i say its just not that important to me3 apparently you do care what i sayenough to remember something from another thread just as apparently youve misquoted me from that thread in point of fact what i said in that thread was there was no practical way for a solo miner to tank a hulk in high sec 07 and below against a suicide ganker in such a way that the hulk would survive thats paraphrasing what i said to incorporate the context of the discussion rather than an exact quote of what i saidthe key word there was practical if youd care to prove me wrong with the vast knowledge youve accumulated in your two years of play do so i stand ready to acknowledge your achievementassuming you meet the criteria inherent in the term practicalwindjammer
an exact duplicate of your post 110 in this thread i dont think ive ever reduced anyone to this particular level of incoherency beforewindjammer
youve already declined my offer to do so and are clearly still incapable of figuring it out on your ownwhich brings me back to why should anyone put any stock in your experience when you seem more interested in trolling goons than in addressing game balance issues
no really
this might seem like a silly idea but i figured i might as well share it and see if anyone else thinks it could workas i was reading the igs and seeing peoples in character replies to the fictional news story about the two teens in rens who blinded themselves i noticed that several people have offered to make donations of isknow realistically those donations will never be collected on but it got me thinking back to another fictional event the disaster that laid the framework for the second caldari and gallente war when that nyx crashed into the ishukone headquaters when that took place a lot of people in character talked about contributing isk alsoso why cant their be an actual way to donate isk for that matter why not a way to donate isk that could go toward charity in the real world so here is the basic plan i thought of 1 players contract isk contributions to a ccp controlled npc it would have to be done by ccp just way to much temptation here to do a memorable scam in eve history 2 at the end of every month if the contribution is enough one or more gtcs are bought through the normal exchange means with this isk but instead of being given to or used by a player the us dollar value of the gtc is donated to an actual charity on ccp and the eve player bases behalf i dont ever think it will be a whole lot but it be something and worth while in my view
use ingame roleplaying events to eventually benefit out of game causes no programming required either way people will feel good about participating eve could do this for sure also huge press coverage ccpeasy 90 in the csm that can take less than 5 minutes with absolutely no discussion
ah what the hell cant hurt mentioning can it
you can already smartbomb them just like scan probes
could we please make it so that contract auctions end times are shown and incorporate a 15 minute sniper tool this benefits the seller and the buyer and would help me tremendouslyi find it irritating to come across a commodity i want an be told less than a day which could be anywhere from an hour and 1 minute to 23 hours and 59 minutes not very helpfulalso it would be nice to make a maximum bid and that would allow you to bid the minimum needed to beat the other guy up to the maximum you set sort of an ebay systemthanks
shamelessly supporting this with my alt lol
mining isnt a real profession anymore 1 you almost need 2 characters to mine haul and mine  mining bonusthe exumers cant hold not much so it needs to eject the ore into larger cans which need to be picked up if you dont have a second account the can will be flipped and if it isnt the miner cant pick it up with a normal industrial because the rats will kill it need to skill for transporters2 exumers have a hard time to tank beltsthe hulk hasnt got a very large shield buffer so it depends on its small sig radius about cruiser size while this works against bs rats it does a very poor job on frigs cruiser and battlecruiser spawns3 other sources bring too much minerals on the marketratting brings too much minerals on the market this is most apparent in the drone regions4 riskreward is out of balanceratters have a much lower risk of being destroyed by rats or enemies then miners exumers are very slow and cant warp off fast and have no other defense options
1 i agree with the mining bonus but no pvepvper gets bonuses solo however there are no rigs for miners at this time this means that you can put on 2 cargohold optimization rigs with 2 rigs only you can haul just over 10k with 2 rigs and a t2 expander you get about 13k ive never run 2 rigs and 2 t2 expanders however i imiagine youd get about 15k this means that with 3 minute cycles a basic miner will get 34 cycles of their lasers in this is 912 minutes you dont need a hauler you dont have a jet can so cant get can flipped2 you have a drone bay quit tanking small ships and pop them a miner with t2 mediumslights will pop any frigatedestroyer spawn before it does much damage they can pop cruisers with a bit of work they can also pop bc with some work you just have to train to defend yourself3 the drone regions dont drop loot they drop alloys alloys refine into minerals by design drone npcs dont have bounties these alloys are the bounties loot drops pick a better argument for this point or realize that you are incorrect4 you have drones you have a defence option you have turret slots you have a defense option if you want better options go mine in a battleship the yield can be close to a regular barge and is safer for youim a pure industrialist so yes i do know what im talking about i mine high sec low sec null sec learn your trade better id support your initial statement sadly on the basis of there are no rigs for miners or pirate implants however compared to other pve optionspvp those are the only two lacking items for miners
well being a miner for a year now in a 00 corp i do know what i talk about1 well the mining bonus is a plus no real big issue but the hauling is a hulk fitted with 2 cargorigs has one medium slot less because it needs a cap recharger for the shield booster if you would use both lows for cargo expanders you got 10k this may look a nice ammount but it isnt often miners need to go out to other systems where there isnt a station flying a hulk up and down is very slow and not really worth it a ratter has the option to drop a secure cargo can somewhere in the system where it can dump its loot a miner has not this option secure cargo container is a bit small for ore2 i need t2 medium drones to pop the rats that leaves no space for mining drones also it is very common that 6x bcs spawn if a hulk does not warp out quick its dead mind you i got max shield skills and have fitted a phitib small shield booster and a domi shield amp problem in drone region is that the rats do more then 2 dmg types which will force a hulk to fit 2x invuls which arent enough to tank those spawns3 while alloys as drops sound good it isnt if they are refined they give out even the rarest minerals where a normal miner has to go out in special belts and has to skill in order to mine even those ores thats a bad design no ratter cant be allowed to bring back more minerals then a miner can mine that kills the mining profession4 often a miner will leave one rat alive so it is assured he wont get a spawn it cant handle if an enemy warps in the hulk cant never tank the rat and the enemy the slow speed and the short targetingrange makes things even worse an enemy can easily kill you from 40k distance oh and about the turret slots you cant fit guns and missile launchers no need to get personal every miner thats within a real 00 corp knows what i am talking about
is your argument that mining isnt a profession anymoreor that solomining in 00 isnt a viable professionwhy arent if you want to solomine do it in highlow sec or fleet up with corpmates to mine in 00 good responses to your post ive never actually tried 00 mining before but i never really assumed it was a solo task to begin with had it been a viable profession for you before
well good question i compare the mining profession to the other major income for players ratting questing for highsec what do ratters get while rattingdrones alloys which refine in all types of ore salvaged parts which can be used for the production of rigsnon drones bounty faction gain modules which can be sold or refined for minerals salvaged parts which can be used for the production of rigsratters get rare spawns sometimes which give out better loot or a nice ammount of minerals in case of a transport spawni dont have very much info on the rewards for questing because i always was in 00 where questing is non existantwhat do miners get ore which can be refined for minerals true they can be selective in the ore they want to mine but the ore isnt an endless supply and only spawns once every weekbut to answer your question direct miners should not be forced into fleets to make some money in the end every profession should have about the same risktimeisk ratio and right now it isnt
ofc there is a rig for miners drone ones wich bring in more mining amountmining is not meant to be solo operation so as such cant be compared to rating
you think is should not be a solo operation
says who show me and ill shutupalso level 4s werent supposed to be solo operations either that was said
miners have to mine jet can and then get a hauler to move their ore right well as a mission runner i have to get the mission which also exist in 00 go to the area for the mission spend the time to finish the mission book mark the areas go turn in the mission come back with a salvage boat im not wasting spots on my bs for salvagers tractor beams and salvaging rigs salvage all the wrecks and then go back for another mission pardon me if i think it is completely fair that a miner would have to haul his own minerals back to station if he wants to solo if i as a mission runner want to salvage while doing the missions i either invite a friend to tag along and salvage while we go also reaping the reward of the leadership bonuses or i gimp my setup the way you would have to in the same way minus mining drones and using cargo rigsthis is fair and balanced as far as i can tell pvpers dont get a solo iwin button so either should miners  pveers or anyone in an mmothis is just my 2 iskfj
well first of all you got an option if you want to fit the salvager or not furthermore the loot that drops during rattingquesting is small enough to fit in one or 2 secure containers which can be anchored within the system thats saves the trouble to fly to the station last thing is ever flew in a hulk those are very slow boats which take ages to warp a ratting boat is much faster and can back and forth much faster then a miningshipand last thing pvp isnt a profession its where we spend our money on which we make with ratminetrade
actually i do also fly a hulk and my bs with 3x trimark and 2x 1600mm plates aligns just about as slow if not as slow and i do have the option to fit a salvager you have the option to fit combat drones i can keep some of the loot but i still have to make trips back for all of the loot along with bringing in another ship for salvage since i wont waste my high slots to fit a salvagerwhich is precisely what i was telling you you also have the options just like i do you just want to make it faster and easier for you to not have to use these options i too would like these but then it makes game play too no brainer which if i wanted i would cancel my account and start playing wow no thank youfj
i dont think the professions are intended to be compared directly like that im not suggesting that mining doesnt need a buff of some sort likely through reducing dropped modules in missions but just because theyre different doesnt mean they have to be equalized mmo sexiness arises out of the differencesspecifically doesnt mining scale with fleets better than mission running or ratting my understanding of ratting admittedly limited is that most of the challenge is in finding the rats and avoiding the gank numbers give you more security from the gank but dont particularly make finding rats easier as such youre splitting a reasonably fixed reward between increased numberswith missioning the reward is even more rigidly fixed true a second salvaginghauling alt contributes significantly to your mission running speed but beyond that you quickly run into a mission running overhead picking up the mission turning it in getting to and from the mission salvaging hauling slowboating to gates etc ultimately it doesnt scale well in larger groups level 5 missions may be an exception to this i dont knowwith mining you have to know where the asteroids are to mine but in most cases adding more players significantly increasing the amount mined its less than a linear increase to be certain but five people mininghaulingguarding in a mining op sees much more benefit from the larger gang than 5 people missioning or ratting i would thinkis this not true
as a mostly missionrunner who has helped on mining ops before yes it is truei take a single battleship into a lvl 4 and lets say i finish it in 30 minutes now ill take a friend of similar skill levels in and we get it down to 20 minutes a third friend might get it down to 15 minutes depending upon the mission any more than that however and its really just splitting the reward too many ways to be worthwhileas for ratting in the drone regions have you ever ratted in the drone regions i have its painful it sucks you get through one belt spawn and then you have to go back to station to drop off loot and then you have to sell it to make money this is compared to being able to go out kill rats for a few hours and have the money automatically in your wallet you can do it in smaller ships and you dont have to worry about having a hauler behind you just to grab the loot when ratting though there is also the problem as mentioned of finding rats a single person in a system with say 8 belts can get a fairly decent amount ratting add a second person in though and suddenly there is now only four belts per person 4 belts does not great income makenow for mining a single person mining in a hulk has to make some sacrifices to be able to tank the rats and to be able to gtfo if a player comes in to kill them theyll have to have a hauler to move the ore or constantly be warping back and forth with their hulk now lets make that a two people they still have the problem but only one person has to go move the ore every once in a while  a significant improvement as the other person can continue mining now lets make that 5 people 4 hulks and a hauler suddenly all your problems have gone away except the random pvper who anyone would have to worry about anyways and your monetary income is increased dramatically as well as you keep adding more people to the mining fleet you start getting more and more money per playerno other profession scales up as well as mining does yes mining solo sucks but because of the ease at which it scales up i believe that its perfectly balanced with the other professionsarazel
guys i aint talking about more isk read my posts again oh and yes i live in drone regions well my main does  so i know about ratting therejust curious how many ships are out there to rat with compare that with mining shipshow many setups do you know you can use to rat with compare that with mining shipssee where i am getting at it isnt about the isk its about some attention from the devs all the loot that drops during ratting destroys mining profession not because you get more isk but because mining isnt needed anymore ratting should be about bounties rep gainslosses saving the universe not about getting stuff you can refine for ore thats just plain stupid
you cant really use this argument irl how many ways can you mine coal you use the shovel or a bigger shovel or maybe a shovel on a tractor and then you need a way to move it  a shovel cant really carry muchthis should be addressed by changing ratting mechanics and not mining mechanics the scaling argument remains the strongest because a mining buff would make mining fleet ridiculous
i completely agree with the other folksmining isnt meant to be entertaining and it isnt meant to be exciting its meant to bring in resources to fuel the economy1 take a look at real life mining either surface or underground equipment works day and night chewing through dirt and rock to find whatever then that gets hauled by other people to be processed it was only in the beginnings of mining when a single guy has a mine shaft and a cart that he chipped away ingots and then rolled them out himself2 now take a look at some other video games like starcraft for instance you build a group of the smallest and most lowly workers and point them at a gas processing plant or a group of crystals they walk out chip at the rocks and walk back looks terribly exciting right now realize that thats you chipping at rocks and bringing them backi too fly a hulk and i solo all the time difference being i have expanders and optimizers fitted i can fit 6x gsc inside giving me over 24k m3 worth of ore with each trip so dont tell me that it cant be done in that ship maybe you cant make it happen but thats on youmining isnt a glorious job and no amount of whining and btching to ccp will ever make it more than a chore a single rung on the ladder a link in the chain
well mining isnt fueling the economy thats been replaced by other meansi do have 2 cargo rigs fitted in my hulk and 2 cccs in my other hulk you know why because you need the 2x ccc in order to have enough cap to tank a belt and dont bring me the a mining vessel should not be able to tank a belt because you should read the description on the hulk but maybe you should come to our space for a while and try to tank the spawns there with that setupand about the 6 gsc well that aint possible because that would mean every cycle would dump some ore into space because it will not fit in the room thats left in your hold
what other means are you referring to because im pretty sure that building anything requires minerals first off and even recycling every bit of loot you find wont allow you to fuel a production career as well as mining wouldyoure right its impossible and im just doing the impossible every time i go outyou jettison a can or two right on top of yourself and let the ore fall into the hold then you shunt it into a can to free up the space again if someone threatening should show up you cut off the lasers and scoop the cans back inside taa daa 6x gsc inside the ship 24k m3 of ore every trip
this idea is pathetic
if there is spare time to develop this then why not
what on earth has this got to do with a dark and ruthless empty space universe simulatorof all the horrible ideas
only if you can punch someone in the face for playing scatman or some other vile creation
im sorry you rather play the rusty trombone than look into issues which should have higher priorityvote of no confidence impeachment wtf gtfo all of you
leave it to a goon to make a mockery of the csm
w00t
apparently you dont get 80
if it wasnt because i was on an airplane at the time of the meeting it would have been an 81
itd be cool if you can play chess or a battleship type game with other players while in stations waiting for ops the music thing seems a bit gay but sometimes gay is good right
pretty much sums up my sentiment this is an attempt by a goons to pretty much show how ineffectual csm is since they posted the idea to ccp and if ccp should the developers be all high on acid and x decide to implement it would be a great waste of resources
this is an elaborate fakepost by a goon no other explanation for it otherwise the op would already be kicked out of gfedit as previous posters have implied this reeks of goonery and an attempt to implement a feature awkwardly at odds with the current eve theme just for lulz
what i dont get is all but the other goons not choosing to abstain its not a bad idea to have fluff in the game its just not anywhere near the top of issues you should be voting on and putting forth to ccpso whereas not a completely moronic idea it had no place on the table and the other nonhive minds on the csm shouldve opted to abstain or vote it down to demonstrate its low level priorityyouve put forth suggested solutions and reports on how many of the repeatedly addressed issues yet
it will not take much time from ccp it took all of 5 minutes im assuming from the csm and they all liked it as well as a lot of posters here why is this a failure i cant wait to hold my benefit concert for the slaves and everyones gonna be doing blue pill and xinstinct wont eve look great on your lsd screen
id answer your question but it makes absolutely no sense being that youre asserting yourself some form of authority on the subject i hate to burst your bubble but the prioritization of items comes after all of the issues have made it onto the agenda an issue being voted into the dialog or not has no bearing on its prioritizationim sure you know that though being expert on what the csm doesdoesnt or shouldshouldnt be doing
anybody who doesnt see the genius of this idea clearly lacks the imagination to realize its potential these same people probably would have poopooed steamboats trains and telephones were they alive centuries ago
sUFFFD por favor
surprise surprise it made it on the agendayet they shelved discussion on the scramblerweb changes to some point in the future when its too late to do squat after 25 minutes of mostly meaningless discussion i puked a little in my mouth when i read the minutes
i puked a little in my mouth when i read this post please visit your user settings to reenable images
no i think the idea is more like the privacy shield for urinating in your car like the japanese have nice way to waste valuable csm time with utterly trivial exercises in lets show how pathetic the system safequards are when i can introduce and get passed ideas that should never have made it past first readiing obviously the csm issue system needs additional ways to block other monumentally idiotic ideas in the futurethanks for palpably pointing that outedit any more cute little graphics youd like to add so you dont need to have an argument

err what is it i cant steal it if i dont know how to use it
were capsuleers not street musicians
ill explain my reason musical instruments in ambulation wont break the game for anybody and some people might enjoy it  hoped that by supporting one of their ideas it might make them more responsive to some of the 00 sovereignty suggestions that would improve the game for people currently looking at the minddeadening horror of lagfest pos dogpiles and perhaps get us a chance to promote a visionary idea of the kind that ccp did ask for to the next formal meeting part of committee work is horsetrading and barter  but on this occassion the compromise was all onesided  still you have to try right
so what youre saying is that in true democratic fashion you choose to ignore all the relevant issues and pass the fluff to apeace the masses
but how would you prioritize this idea on a low to high scale
i guess that depends on how you vote on it
not really a vote is an either or not a sliding scale
man what is wrong with you guys why do you all hate music
can the csm please concentrate on more important issues like the nano nerf etc first please
it depends on if they vote high or low it depends on how they prioritize it so far all thats decided is if its on the list not where on the list
exactlywhat is the point of bringing up and issue if you already know its a lowpriority issue i personally think that is the case here
because we dont already know this if im not mistaken this gets a lot more positive support than other issues so it may yet be determined by the csm that this is important to the player base which is why there will be a votethere are 9 csm delegates there are thousands of players you are one opinion dont damage your pretty decent imo reputation by trying to block this pretty decent imo idea
because its cool and theres no way to tell if ccp would implement something like this on their own or if theyd notice it without the csm
a splendid idea in principle diminishing returns combined with a de facto hardcap or rather saturation which is more precise i guess is a very good option to prevent ludicrous speeds as opposed to nerfing an entire form of pvp combat into extinctionhowever imho the actual formula would need some tweaking the sacri is going too fast in comparison to the vaga and same would be true for the ishtar i suppose the problem is if you have ships with de facto trackingless weapons drones and missiles going too fast they can deliver their full dps while being unhittable themselves which is a central part of the whole nano problematic the vagabond on the other hand as a turret ship does not have this luxury imho it should go considerably faster then any other hac with nanos how you actually manage that be it by tweaking the formula or tweaking the vagas stats doesnt matter really thoughespecially
yea the formula has quite a lot of scope for change but i dont think there is too much of a problem as atm sacs go 4kms on average which will be nerfed to 35kms and vagas go just over 6kms which will be nerfed to 5kms so the speed difference between the two only decreases by 500msbut like i said before this formula is just a rough sketch atm 
i support there is no need to nerf mwd class and speed spree in general
very good post and idea redfor the proplem for other hacs ceptors they are going to fast for you maybe ccp can add extra fromula for the mwd speed  like the warp speedso they can leave the moduls untoucht and can tweak the ship it self and they are not needet to change the mass of the shipmaybe this is a option too
i didnt like nano for sure but after looking at the test server i think ccp hit it to hard i feel that nano ships as a game play should be an option regarding my personal feelings i think nano ships need to reasonably killable i do not agree with the current nano nerf however its too broad and ccp will need to change many models and ships that will be effected and god knows when we will see balance this idea right here is viable let intys do there job
sorryyour vaga is as fast as a interceptor also why would someone use a abccps idea makes abs viable your idea does not ccps idea makes nanoships commiting to a fight viable your idea does not
i support this in principal however i think that this could do with a littlbe bit of tweaking for example rather than beingnewspeed  oldspeedit should instead simply take this into account when calculating the speed initially so that ships are still able to be bumped beyond normal speeds edited for support
yea i wanted to do that initially but i have no idea what equations ccp uses atm so i had to make do with this the equation itself can change its the idea that slower ships dont get nerfed too hard and stupid speed ships get nerfed badly thats important
ccps idea kill nanoships fullstop so there will be no commiting to a fight also ccps idea actually nerfs afterburners from a 150 boost to only 100 and they are only useful in rare circumstancesalso i dont see how the vaga is as fast as an interceptor even with full faction and snakes you cannot push it much past the 6k area which a ceptor can beat easily most the pvp vagas you will see will be 5kms or lower
ab stats can and probably will be tweaked further ccps idea removes mwd as mandatory item when fitting a ship yours does not afs are also still useless and close range combat  not moving at all due to 90 webs
point 1 damn straightpoint 2 hes talking about how fast he thinks interceptors should go well either that or the 7 kms vagabonds against the slower interceptors something that only holds up when you take implants out of the equationpersonally though id tweak the factors in that equation heavily but even then it doesnt quite hold to my idea because of the mass jump between ship classes in short though i want to say that i think that any ship but a ceptor clocking 25 kms is broken and that we should implement some other sort of defense alternatives especially against missiles that work together with speed instead of trying to find a middle ground when it comes to speeds which we wont at this point because it has to be set too high and factor in mwds which have been both hit with the nerf bat cause implausible ship characteristics and still give a 500 speed bonus placing pvp combat on two different levels of speed slow boating or holywtfbbq1one
whats better having assault ships slightly better at shooting big targets or completely removing a very large chunk of pvp and rendering a lot of ships useless
interesting idea but something still needs to be done about frigates in general thenthey should be considerably faster than hacs
i guess you mean interceptors and i dont see a problem all hacs except the vaga go 4kms normally and a standard t2 fitted ares can do 8kms so whats the problem
you obviously have no clue what your talking about shuuush as my ceptor goes much faster than my vaga and abs will still suck and will not be viable at allps this is great idea red thunder and you obviously did your homework great job
well frigs arent ment to be fast at anyhting but tackling really i mean tbh how long did you stay in a frig hac take alot of training not only that but minm specifically are ment to be faster than the rest i think that this idea the red thunder has come up with is a great idea and well thought out not a huge nerf but enough to reign in the stupid ones then again if your moving at 35ms you arent stopping anytime soon beside theres nuthin better than watching them bounce off the gate when your in a rapier  although after this nerf they are gonna be crap too this nerf just isnt very well thought out it will effect the industial side as well as the pvp side as they may as well be nerfing minm invention too
outstanding idea ccp take note
i like the above suggestion but in effect ccp have all ready done the above with their rebalancing of the speed curves for the relative ship classes basied upon the game mechanic equations the balancing of astrautic rigs incomparison to their parent modules is again another good soultion to the issue and comforms to the balancing of the speed curves lowering web effectiveness supports these changes aswell by not eliminating speed altogether its the rest of the nerph that is the major issue1scrams completed turning off mwds effectively removes mwds from any close combat engagement fits there is no other module in the game that has a 100 neutralizing effect on another for example ecms used to have that effect now they are chance baised even as a middle ground making the suggested effect of a scram chanced baised would be more preferable to completely invalidating a module2missiles  i dont know how many times i see people mention missiles and defender missiles at the current sisi speed those ships designed to speed tank intys vagabond frigs can avoid or tank minimal damage from any of the other weapon types some are more effective with the suggested changes and thats not necessarily a bad thing medium t2 drones should be able to catch most crusiers t1t2 thats why the drones fall into the same base tactics as the races valkeries are faster but have less armorshields infiltrators have more armor and are generally slower than other drones etc turrets can be out run at sub 1k speeds with the aid of tracking disruptors and the rebalanced webs frigs can now survive to a degree in web range can perform their jobs properly these are changes that will work however one weapon type remains un changed or negitively effected by the suggested nerph thats missilescurrently there is only one effective counter measure against missiles speed defender missiles are broken and dont perform their role well there have been plenty of suggested solutions to this from chance baised missile specific ecm systems to auto firing defender missiles or auto turret missile defense not one suggested solution or alternative soultion to the missile problem has been included in this nerph effectively missiles will now hit everything without any counter being availiable the cerberus is the extreme example of this as it currently stand a cerb can fire of light and heavy missiles at an approximate speed of 8kms with average skills with good skills 10kms add to the other bonuses this ship provides and no ship designed for speed is going to be able to touch the cerb as i said thats the extreme end of the spectrum3web drones  gives that nanoing is so popular i would have thought the first good balancing option apart from the above speed curve adjustment would be to include medium and light web drones if kept in balance with the other ewar drone specs these wouldnt be overpowered or excessive new web drone rigs have come out boosting web drone effectiveness making them a more viable option against nano boats combine that with the optimal range module and your web drones will have an effective range at maximum of 15km a viable soultionwall of text over nice one red o
this is a rediculously goooreaaaattt ideathey need to undo every single change from this nerf and start this nerf from scratch with this concept
yep technologically dx and mssql seems like a joke for a project like eveonline
i hope ccp will pay the crossover licence too
with ambulation on the horizon and sousaplaying abilities the dull grey bland colours of eve have turned into more vivid lively variants of their older gritty counterparts i am speaking metaphorically of course many features seems to have been made as to cater to the vox populi instead of providing at least the semblance of an unforgiving vacuum of space where bodies burn families are left to ruins and corporations become outmaneuvered and their work force starving to deathit seems the message of oveur from last years fanfest proclaiming love have overwhelmed the eveuniverse and in spite of war its a war with shades of pink and purple because those within that war are protected from the nasty alliances pve content is being expanded etc and so on now prepare yourselves because im going to contradict myself a little i accept that this type of content will make it into eve to a certain extent but i implore ccp to also make sure that there are pitfalls for every pink cloud that people catch without the punjitrap vietcong tm setup just nearby the pink bunny the morbid consistency will falter in essence what i want is to keep consequences a vital part of this game because the more we remove them the less of a hardcore game we have which made eve unique from the getgo theres a reason why theres a 100 world of warcraft out there and only one eveonline theres enough of i get to keep all my loottype pvp rules against scamming and all that please do not cater more to that audienceyouve removed several ways of scamming people already and i realize that in some of the cases these were a necessary change but alongside outlaws being marginalized noobaccessible pvp and red tape lining the good from the bad i see an eve which taste has been becoming more bland to the taste while this issue is not bringing up specifics i think this is a general theme in eve that we need to make it less shiny  colourful and pretty and more dark ominous  like a cold blade to the neck the moments before it sinks inside and draws blood its time to bring the cold into the dark cold space of eve
couldnt agree more in principle this would be the csm seeking reassurance from ccp that this is still the most important part of their grand vision
how do you suggest ccp improve on thisi fully agree but what kind of changes would you like to see being made to facilitate this feelingedit forgot to support
i started this january 8 months only now so i cant agree without more specifics explain to me how it isnt dark enough or how it is too shiny willing to change my mind here with enough argument
bumpeh for your viewing pleasure
i like your answer to the missile problem point defense sensors are a great antimissile tactic that should be implimented
bump i like it
mechwarrior 4 had a defense system on some of their mechs called laser antimissile system or lams for short if installed unto the mech the system would fire at and destroy 12 missile volley as soon as they got within 300 meters of the mech i think this would be a more efficient option compared to the clumsy defender systemthe range of this system should be 5km10km and it system could stop working when the missiles are fired off within its firing range 5km10km that way rockets arent completely useless also this system should be a high slot as it is effectively a weapons system it would also act as a damage control in the sense that you can only have one activated at all times and it uses no cap this also means that the system will only shoot missiles being shot at you that way a blob of ships is not able to effectively make a missile boat uselessim sure this would make some of the recon pilots with highslots to spare very happy if they could destroy one incoming heavycruise missiletorpedo out of a volley of 56just thought this idea was more interesting than making current ew modules do magic tricks
here is some more more cleverness i am unsure whether if i can lend this suggestion my full support though because of the lack of regard to bonuses check more on this mans thread in the ships and modules sectionalso i am still hoping that this thread will somehow attract some csm members attention
fill me in what kind of bonuses are you talking about
specific ecm bonuses the existing ones to the existing ships would make certain ships stronger and others weaker against missile assaultfor example it is generally known that if youre a pilgrim or falcon pilot you will not have very much of a chance read no chance at all against certain missilebased ships and passive tanks i propose to add some diversity and possibly turn this around by making these ships which receive bonuses to ewar capable of highly reducing the effectiveness of a missile salvo but at the cost of being able to target ships specifically with said ewarin short the missile ships will be able to fire on them but with the missiles effectiveness greatly reduced its another facet of reducing hit chance by speed reducing hit and damage by signature and reducing taken damage by resistancebasically regular ships which do not have ewar bonuses might be able to cut a missile salvos damage by 3060 but this does not become such a horrible weakness because these ships are combatfocused and should thus be able to tank or outrun the rest of the missiles with enough effectiveness ewar ships though which have long had no defense against fof missiles and suffered completely at the hands of missile tanks can by sacrificing some ability to torture the missilebearing ship approach levels of 90 or possibly even come close to the levels where they are able to stop all missiles and act as a screen for the rest of their gang thus giving them a whole new fleet dynamic but this at a rather severe cost of offensive abilitiesof course all this also has the intended effect of lending some new purpose and buff to tracking disruptors and target painters which largely seem to be seen as underpowered and without purpose at the moment
i like
another excellent idea was recently added to the forum and i feel that it is my responsibility to bring attention to it so that if that thread or this one drops past page 1 it still has a good chance of being noticed furthermore it could very well work together with the changes that i have proposedyou will find it right here
ewar is supposed to be specific tds for turrets ecm for locking rsd for targeting tp for sig radius if were gonna have an anti missile system it should be a new module unto itself not giving an already existing module an extra role
if theres anything that ive tried to get across then its that you shouldnt be so drastic when it comes to these changes because that will just lead to people exploiting things whether they be the ones being exploited now or the ones that will have the scales tilted in their favor in the future insteadas it is with the presence of fof missiles are able to override ecm and countermeasures completely and deal a substantial amount of damage while costing the user ship little to nothing in usage and thus enabling them to put up a tremendous active tank i propose that we deal with this problem directly instead of doing something silly like introducing cap costs to firing launchers or nerfing specific ships that are actually fineyour argument falls on three points firstly we want to balance what might potentially become missile dominance out and doing that by giving all ships an equal chance to counter missiles is not the way to go because some clearly dont deserve that level of protection as they already have enough speed or tank secondly it is almost specifically recon and ewar ships that have suffered and been left in the dust by missile ships and if they have not they will be by the speed patch since these two points coincide very neatly it would be recommendable giving the ewarcapable ships better options for matching missiles adding to their usefulness but only reasonably and introducing a whole new level of fleet dynamism to themthirdly adding an entire module and making it require a high slot in addition and making it so that it would probably require its own bonus is three levels of redundancy what youre talking about is precisely like defender missiles except not taking up a launcher point and without ammoand those points aside we need an excuse to use target painters at all we really really do
youre thinking way too much fleet here solo or smallgang battles are equally if not more important at this point and when it comes to the ecms we have ea ships and recons all of which are vulnerable to the damn missiles fofs knock out drones for a lot of cost or they just go straight for the ship or they divert between equally important targets so i dont know whether if youre being presumptious or selfconvenient probably both either way you dont have any right to declare my point null just like thatyeah this seems unbalanced and doesnt really help with the dynamism not to mention that the ships which need to escape missiles through other means than just taking the damage have precious few high slots to start withare you thinking id want to completely eliminate the other functions of the ewar if so you havent read what ive said and youre once again being presumptuous and selfconvenientthe gist is that youd have to choose you cant and shouldnt be able to make a ship strong against everythingyeah and hell still be able to put out enough to kill off a recon or a eas with ease unless they can outfly the missiles but recons werent really meant to fly that fast and eas ships dont have slots to spareits funny how you immediately choose a fleet battle as the first example as well by the wayyeah well its too indirect its not as significant a change as you seem to think the excluding preference for webifiers wont change among minmatar pilots and since missiles will be getting a buff and minmatar ships rather nerfed expect people to stop buying and train caldari instead
it is high time that our csm reps take on an issue that plagues thousands of eve subscribers we the members of goonfleet and goonfleetcom have been subjected to the inane rantings and general uselessness that is igne ds1 btls arsed etc posting for far to long we move that these terrible posters have their posting rights removed from goonfleetcomcsm members this is your chance to actually make a difference in eve and its community please help us rid ourselves of this menace
oh i also support what i wrote above

i posted these comments in the against the speed nerf poll thread which i am admittedly an active part but i felt they were noteworthy enough for their own thread first though what am i on about specifically my thoughts are a reaction to the csm meeting notes that were kindly posted by jade herei am extremely disappointed in the csm reps who voted to put this off and are potentially going to do nothing about this issue until its too latethe entire point of the csm wasis to bring the ideasconcerns of the player base to the ccp devs there are now several thousand votes both for and against telling you to do just that you then turn around and vote directly to not do your job all i can say is wtfthe general consensus of the council was that it is too early to saydo anything about this absolute bullocksfact the against vote poll is winning by more than 2 to 1 at the time of this typing and has been ever since it was posteddoes this give the csm any sort of a clue as to the majority feelings of the player base concerned by this issuesome people claim that the vote has been slanted with alts towards the against but cant the for people use alts too or are they just more honest by nature than the against people fact read any 20 pages hell read any 10 pages of the against poll and the general consensus of the majority vote becomes so obvious that a preschooler could sort it out most people in both the for and against poll when considered as a whole agree that a change is needed to speed but specifically in the against poll many point out that the devs are going way to far and considering too many changes to very basic game play elementsam i totally insane or is this or is this not more than enough information to do your jobs and go to ccp with the idea that they need to at the very least severely reduce the scope of the changes they are consideringbottom line to those reps who voted for moving forward with this issue thank you for keeping the faith with your constituents to those reps who voted directly not to do your jobs shame on you and good luck getting my vote for reelectionnow i know everyone is not going to feel as i do but i felt the need to post as i feel directly betrayed by the csm reps who voted to not do there jobs still something this potentially volitile requiresflamesuit on
theyre right as the csm they dont need to be a middleman in this particular case instead any player can with documented evidence of these changes based on test server experience put forward their case to ccp as to why these changes are too muchwhereas the csm is more there for getting ccp to put ideas forward for testing by the player base on sisias people will be quick to point out a large proportion of the player base dont even post on the forums as a result as there is only 1200 votes against the nerf out of a subscription base of 200000 does this mean that 99 of the player base is happy with the proposed nerf obviously not but then statistics can always be manipulated to show what the poster wantsagreed with this part hence why people need to be testing these proposed changes to their limits to show precicely why these changes are a step too far saying that the nerf is too much as itll kill x tactic isnt enough turning round and saying based on test server experience the changes to webs 50 effectiveness make blaster boats an unviable prospect due to unforseen effects on transversal velocity perhaps scaling web effectiveness based on hull mass instead of a fixed percentage would be a better idea lighter ships easier to slow down as theres less mass for the web to have to try to slow down would be more likely to get a positive response as its constructive in its critisism
it is never a good idea to let the inmates run the prison their interests are not in sync with the purpose of the prisonsimilar here all the vote proves is that there is a number of people incl their alts who are upset their iwin button is taken away from themit has been proven time and time again that players are the most unsuited to evaluate balance changes simply because the large majority are not able to see a bigger picture than their own little narrow worldie what broken game mechanics help them feel uber is obviously good for the game and if you think the csm not telling ccp that there is an issue here will mean ccp are not aware of it then seriously you should get a cluecsm could go all serious to ccp and say there is an issue here with a number of players wanting to keep their iwin button and ccp could just smack their forehead and reply thank you for pointing out the bloody obvious
i think you nailed it there the nanu nanu wants to keep on winning with a broken feature theyre a cheating breed that will stop at nothing to achieve an unfair advantagethat said i guess its time to bring out the alt brigade
its frustrating to have to flip back and forth between two show info windows to compare different module attributes can the ui be updated to support multiple windows so we can look at the attributes of modulesships etc side by side
next time you want another show info window hold down shift when you hit the blue info icon or select show info from a pull down it will open another window
or just turn the option to use only 1 window off in the general settings 
ok so im a noob i wasnt aware it was even possible thanks for the suggestions ill try them and now ill go edit my original subject line so this gets dropped or deleted
yep the graphic is ugly and made worse by the fact that in fleet fights they seem to slow your fps down considerably more than anything else on screen please changeim guessing you have an nvidia card i have exactly the same problem which for some reason only happens on the sensor booster rings and webs you can fix it by going to you nvidia control panal and 3d settings and disabling triliniar optimization least that seems to work on my pc
i like the construct of the idea heregets my supportthe rock fairy
even if i somewhat think that these hypertechnologic ships which in addition seem rather like solid blocks right now would most likely be able to tolerate a great deal of stress this whole idea very much appeals to me and i would like to see it implemented with or without the changes that i myself have proposed
rezaa check out this thread
theres a far wider assortment 1 day alts in the much smaller for nerf thread tbhit doesnt matter though voting on same account alts according to ccp is detectable and will be accounted foror more likely they just wont listen and push through whatever fits their fancy
nope ccp should not ignore input but they dont have to follow it either they should read the input think about it perhaps test a bit of the alternative suggestions and then react upon it the way they see fit and that can be to continue without changes
oh god this is hilarity introduce the beauracracy to stop what the bearuracracy started like killing yourself with a weapon you made brilliant
the votes here are to be used as a guide and not as a final say ccp has realized there is an obvious speed flaw and is attempting to find a cure those voting for or against are essentially voting on just how much of a nerf speed tanks get mark my word speed will change with or without support votes
oh come on dont tell me you guys dont ever use ecmperhaps thats exactly why we need higher meta modules its like there were only t2 gyrostabs and heat sinks supporting myself d
supported it should be doable because like he says your ships computer has to have the navigation info in order to warp to it theres no real reason i can see that it shouldnt be an option
likely it has something to do withi like your idea for exploration as ive lost a helios to npcs when i got uncloaked and stuck on an asteroid i couldnt see lol but in terms of pvp ccp tends to cast the dice in favour of the defenderyour change would almost always favor the attacker even in cases where its presumed the defender has a slight margin of safety or warning theyre about to be jumped like running a plexsite in a ship not suitable for pvp
even though this would make my job a lot easier i think it would unbalance pvp making it possible for cosmic signatures only would be fair though
maybe just limit this to a certain accuracy  if you get too close a result you can not bm it you have to warp there directly like 2x grid size would be fine i think
i think this is a good idea it also makes senseish from an ingame standpoint as well
supported at least for exploration sigs because cov ops have all the tank of a sodden tissue and gas clouds suck
supported
back to the top
the ui is pretty bad at smaller resolutions im not sure how that can be fixed but i would definitely support it being fixed if possible if nothing else fix it so my gui elements stop hopping about my screen when i close adjacent elements
more important than nanonerfsmuch more important than walkingmore important than fwthe fact it hasnt been seriously looked at is indicative of ccps preference for working on things that sound flashy over working on things that impact the customer base
currently we have the option to export some market information to a file i would like to see this functionality expanded outside of just the market interface some other things we should be able to directly export to a filewallet yes i know it can be done outofgame but ease of use is importanttransationssecure container access logscorp member list and rolestitlesscience and industrypersonnel asset listetcthe code is already present to allow exported information this should be a simple code that will make some peoples lives easier
how does what you are asking for differ from the existing mechanic for grouping drones in your drone bay
because you dont need to keep open the whole list of groups in order to be able to launch one hes asking for a rightclick menu option to launch a specific group of drones
big thumbs upwhat should be a simple thing for an annoying lack in the drone gui
permasustains 750dps while doing 600dps and has the ability to stay in range to deal that dps 1 small neut kills you you have no speed so you cant stay in range and youre dead without support id call that a useless sitting duck of a ship
not supporteddrake has already recived a nerf in the tank department and has the weakest firepower of all the bcpersonally i think the drake deserves a firepower increase that it did not revieve last time it was nerfed  8th launcher slot gets my vote
only ppl who do not fly drakes complaine about them simply because they dont know how it is to fly drake yes it awesome tanker if it fitted for killing npcs in belts you complaine about ships what you was after in belts probebly in your nano vaga and was not able to kill itnow i ask you somethingif it so powerfull ship was it able to kill youi guess i know the answere tbh
myrmidon can passivetank better than the drake and do more damage
do not agree drake currently well balanced
why god wont people just shut up drake is fine all its got is tank its useless otherwise they die just fine train up your freakin skillz and they go boom usuck cd
yes the drakes tank is far to goodwe demand the shield resist bonus be turn into a rof bonus this instant  yarr
drake is fine as is as others have mentioned
just make a bomber alt the training time is very short and they are a lot of fun to fly if training the missile skills is a problem then wait until later down the road how you think training drones would be any easier i have no idea because that skill tree is just as time consuming
because a caldari soldier starts out with a ton of missile skills while a gallente spec ops starts out with a ton of drone skills
make a caldari soldier then or train the skills on your gallentee spec ops character its not that hard and the amount of time it would take on your gallentee character isnt long at all vovi know you want multiple ways to do the samething but thats just pointless and can you imagine how overpowered it would be if someone did a ship with bombs and suicide drones
i think that was his point
in my mind anything doing something remotely to another ship is using some sort of nanobots already remote repping nosferatuwhat i think it is you want is mines
well waitthis idea has a few good extensions to ityou could make a specialized ejection module for these drones maybe with cylindrical tubes with acceleration guides in them so they exit at velocity already for faster time to target you can put the acceleration tubes on some sort of swivel mount with a pivot so when they start heading towards their target they dont have to spend time adjusting coursebonus since they can use more room for payloadi think we could call these systems robot aassisted impairment lead devices or railguns for shorti think i could get behind this
i want combat wasps like in the nights dawn books

you do realise that those are speed fitted battleships
im against mainly because you put the vaga among the frigs and interceptors vagabond is a hac and should not have speed agility or mass 8and hence speed like a frig or interceptor
15ks max cap on speedeverything else is called role play
one thing that has always bugged me about eve combat is the fact that weapons fire just passes straight through objects like asteroids stations etc as if they werent even there it detracts from realism and takes away a lot of potential highspeed tactical maneuvering fun in densely packed asteroid belts i think itd be really cool if one could shield ones self from weapons fire by ducking behind an asteroid or a jutting piece of station forcing your opponent to chace you and keep you literally in his sights i could see a case being made for certain weapons being made exempt  drones for instance obviously and maybe missiles since they are presumably smart enough to maneuver around asteroids to the target using sensors possibly warp disruptors and stasis webifiers as well since they act by warping space not simply through channeling energy in a certain direction but ordinary projectile hybrid and laser blasts should impact harmlessly on objects between you and the target leading to a more rich pvp experience in confined areas
i concur this would be a kickass ideasay i am in a pvp with a buddy and my buddies tank is failing i could move between him and said aggressor and take some of the work off of said persons hands i think this would definitely add to the uniqueness and complexity of pvpthe trick is making such a system functional
for a game of eves scale that would be impossible to implement
the problem is the piloting interface in this game simply isnt up to the challenge that works fine for wing commander but when your piloting consists of rotating the screen to doubleclick as the precise method of picking a direction trying to put yourself in the way just seems infeasible
in truth the game actually was this way a long time ago at least for missiles i remember the heady days when you could use asteroids and such for cover from missile fireunfortunately ccp in their infinate wisdom declared it a disaster for whatever reason and took it out a few four i think years back nowill support this because it would add to the realism and be cool but at the end of the day wont have nearly as huge of an impact on the game as the op thinksstill it would be nice to have this feature back
the game has enough issues with lag system load and desyncs with existing collision mechanics i dont think we need to make it worse neato as it would be to fly into an asteroid field to evade torpssorry but no
if performance is an issue maybe we should revisit the idea in a few years when everyone has better machines  technology does tend to improve
seriously spouting crap like that is pointless come back when you learn something about computers
look at how ignorant you arethose calculations are handled serverside then passed on to the client soits server lag not client lag in case you havent noticed eves server isnt up to the task as is adding more calculations isnt going to speed things up for anyonethink before you post
forgive me if im mistaken here but wouldnt this mean a whole lot of additional calculationslets say alice the apocalypse is trying to shoot at bob the brutix in an asteroid belt under the current system alice calculates hit chance based on bobs signature radius and velocity and her guns tracking speed and signature resolution i might have missed something else hereif hits are now colliding with things other than bob then we have some problems since alices guns arent installed on the same point on her hull although they could all be aimed at the same point on bobs hull we must run a target line from each hardpoint and check to see if anything is obstructing a particular line of fire to do that well need to call up the relative positions of every object in the area lets be generous and say a 250km radius from alice compare alices guns positions and bobs position or rather the point on bob that were aiming for to see if we have something in the way of course objects are point masses as far as i can tell  check whereabouts on your ship missiles detonate so wed need to give them volume  yet more calculation if there is an object in the way of some or all of the guns then those obstructed guns will miss hopefully we can then calculate remaining damage as beforeyes it would look cool and add tactical depth if ships are able to use objects as cover but it would make the all computers doing calculations scream for mercy especially if you have eight guns and a lot of nearby objects
this was stopped for a very good reason it was stopped in the first significant missile review the same patch that removed splash damage as all your corpwar enemy had to do was orbit a gate and eventually your missile would hit the gate or a passerby and boom  concord on your assit was also a significant disadvantage generally for missile usersthe reason this couldnt currently be done for turrets is that theres nothing travelling between you and the target as with missiles theres a shiny graphical effect but theres no code for a travelling projectile round etc you just get the flash and the tohitdamage calculations
you probebly not playing long enogh this game toknow that what you ask was actyaly before in game from the begining of this game missels did hit any objects what come in their way be it gates asteroids npc or even passing trough netral pilots not involved in your officel conflicts what it did result ofcourse concord responce and say goodbay to your shipbeleave me if ccp will get that back in game you will be the first who start complaine about that concord did toasted your ship or your ammomissels did hit completely difrent target  or even your corpallaince m8 while in big fleet instead of the target what you want to hitthis is what we got in the past and it is bad i speek out my own experiance and im not supporting this idea at all

where are the minmitar events there have already been big gallente caldari and amarr events im wondering why no minmatar events basically im asking for the council to convince ccp to make an event for the minmatar
i have a sayingno discrimination no special treatment
secondedhowever the use of the term nano annoys the hell out of me is is the use of gay as a derogatory term thats neither discrmination or special treatment but implied negativity  which whilst not directly bad keeps momentum going on the discrimination if you see what i mean i got a bit lost therehell eves oldest character player me is gayedit so that means if i find the use of the word gay or  as derogatory i can petition each use of itfantasticexcuse me whilst i lag the system

the last chatlog posted on evecsm was june 8th if it was one or two meetings i wouldnt mind so much but its been two months
not sure what i can say really its not my site ill keep a record of the chatlogs like i promised and post them somewhere but ultimately the evecsm stuff will have to wait for serenity
sorry if it seemed like im blaming you im not just general annoyance its just as much aimed at ccp of course  if not more serenitys not getting paid for this  but i dont expect as much out of their soontm as i do from a player
could the forum rules be amended so that semiofficial csm threads arent instantly inundated by yet more offtopic demands that jade be burned alive and his family butcheredif agonyveto is going to hijack every thread jade posts in regardless of the content of the original thread nothing is ever going to get doneguys if jade is the bane of your existence and you are determined to have him pulled down and hanged for his terrible crimes make a thread of your own that way i can choose not to click on itthanks
when i post its with my own opinion not that of my corporation if people in my corp happen to post its off their own backs i dont see me hijacking any threads simply putting my albeit harsh opinion forward to be met with a barrage of abuse and hostility from the csm chair because he cant handle the fact someone feels hes doing a bad jobanyway not to cause issues here ill get back on topici agree with how the csm have voted regarding the nano changes i think its a good idea to see how the patch develops since its still only in testing on sisi and is subject to change i think its also a good idea that the csm are waiting and not jumping the gun on the issue its good to see that some of the members can show some restraint and wait to see how the situation will develop theres been a lot of kneejerk reaction and it shows some stability in the ranks of the csm that people can sit back and wait for the patch to evolve in testing before they make any suggestions on how to change it im sure ideas and suggestions are already flooding in past the csm straight to ccp at least thats how it seems from the game development forumon a personal note in most respects i like the changes although it will make life difficult for myself and my corp at times its going to make the lives of a lowsec pirate corp a lot more difficult with the arrival of factional warfare and speed being our only real advantage against the militia blobs since we rely solely on belt pirating income and try to avoid static camping as much as possible the changes to how a bubble camp will work and how sucessful it will be dont really affect usi think that the changes are good for the game overall and in time people will grow accustomed to them im a bit dubious about the changes to the mwd and the addition of a scrambler being able to deactivate it but i think this is purely on personal preference since i have a fondness of blaster boats blaster boats dont seem too gimped by the state of play on sisi at the current build and theres always ways to adapt it just takes timeon a more general note i respect the fact that this is ccps game and we play for the privilege of being able to play it hence ill do what i always do and encourage my corporation to do the same  adapt

rule get over the csm as a corruption watchdog rubbish the idea behind that was thrown out as soon as the csm documents were published by ccp and the direction of the csm was outlined as having nothing to do with that original idea
i think the csms position visavis the nanonerf is a fair one to takefor now what people need to understand is that the csm by design is not something that can react quickly nor should it it is intended to help address the perceived grievances of the players at this stage there are no grievances to be had regarding the nanonerf since nothing is liveyes there is a large amount of change and testing going on over at sisibut its all still being tested and balanced and investigatedif and when the changes get finalized enough to make it into patch notes then and only then should the csm get involved the nano nerf is certainly on their radar to keep an eye on and the vote reflects that however it is entirely inappropriate for them to take a stance on something that isnt even in the damned game yet the csm is a petitioning body and an alternative way to get issues recognized by ccp ccp can and will also hear out player concerns directly if they feel like itand i believe they are closely watching the test server forum for just that feedback theyccp can and will also change anything they want about the game if they feel like it we play in their sandbox not the other way aroundnanos will be nerfed the devs are pretty damn clear on that aspectif for no other reason than they are straining the obsolete physics engine the game uses demanding the csm somehow prevent the inevitable is both useless and wasteful of your time in this world requesting them to have ccp examine or adjust a specific feature of the nerf once its been relatively finalized however is a different situation altogethernow the points against all the posturing and pointless arguing are quite validhowever i also have to agree that someone shouldnt hold their position as enlightened just because of a random survey i applaud the motivation behind seeking informed opinion but a large lump of sodium chloride needs to be taken with ituse something like that to provide some frame of reference but not the crux of a positiontldr theyre dong a decent job could be tighter thoughbut they are acting as a council and not as a rubber stamp
hilmar petursson ccps chief executive said in a telephone interview eve online is not a computer game it is an emerging nation and we have to address it like a nation being accused of corruptionwhere you announce your candidacy and if you win the election they come here to iceland and they can look at every nook and cranny and get to see that we are here to run this company on a professional basisthe ny times and ceo of ccp are incorrect interesting
but cant we do that im sure if we request it based on player feedback we can do exactly thatthough picture of the csm that was drawn by nyt is not how xhagenthe guy who created csm had intended it im sure we can shape the csm ourselves enough for it to be the case
again if you want to live in the past go do so with your triple mwd scorpion
are you familiar with the concept of opinion polling assuming theres no bias in the selection of the random people a poll of 50 has a margin of error of about  14 19 times out of 20 its hardly a tight error bound but it is at least indicative of how people think since im not familiar with the sampling method i cant judge its bias or lack thereof but 50 is a worthwhile starting point for a poll its not as big of a data set as darius would have of course but its a start
well here is the questiondo you go opinion polling a bunch of kids if they want to eat icecream for all 3 meals of the day we all know its not healthy for them but if they think they should hey why not
your analogy is off in this particular instance the better question would be do you ask a bunch of people whove ever eaten it what ice cream tastes likeif i have never tasted ice cream and go out and ask 50 people what it tastes like that isnt going to give me anywhere near the degree of knowledge actually eating a scoop will give thats if the people polled even give me good information or the issue were as black and white as what a flavor is in this case its notedit to add to this my analogy also sucks because were comparing something real life physical science can deal with and a video game there is no past experience to borrow from in a game youve either experienced a mechanic or you havent i hate to speak in absolutes but in this case im afraid it is indeed absolute
ruleofthebonethe csm is not primarily for acting as ccps internal affairs because that was what all the commotion was about a year to a year and a half ago now nobody is really worried about developer corruption and the commotion is about game balance and design accordingly ccp repurposed the csm as a way for players to express game design concerns with the developers hopefully separating the crappy ideas from the good ones in the process
be seriousnobody wandering about in 00 systems where you dont get shot on sight could possibly find a reasonably fair sample of 50 people to ask without extreme bias being driven in through the location of the tour the fact that busy people wont talk to you and the fact that a large number of 00 residents will shoot you on sight
i read over the speed nerf discussionam disappointed that many of the csm are trying to take a higherthanthou feedback role when ccp explicitly asked for sisi testers to provide feedback through a different meansattempting to secondguess developers decisions before those decisions are finalized is disgustingthat is not the csms role half of you recognized that the other half apparently want to be eve developersedit also about samples of 00 stuff i know most of you hate goons with an unhealthy passion but darius is really the only qualified among you to speak with any authority on 00 concernsyou may not like it cause you hate his corp but the rest of you are pretty much inexperienced empire dwellers
as above
just give us faction ammo for our citadel torp launchers and well call it even
role of the csm is to bring issues to the attention of ccp nothing moregame design by democracy no thanksthat would mean the real fights would end up here on the forums rather than out in space like they should be

signedchanges as on sisi are a sledgehammer to crack a nut why to combat ludicrous speed must normal t2 fits be made redundantwhat you should do  reduce the effectiveness of snakes put polycarbons inline with the other astronautic rigs ie worse than a t2 nanofibre but still worth fitting introduce the change to warp scramblers making them shut down mwds make webs signature radius dependant so that a battleship or cruiser running mwd can be webbed 90 by a t2 web but a frigate not running a mwd will be webbed by as little as 3340 boost the velocity and explosion velocity of precision missiles slightlywhat you should not do change the current stats or balance of t1 named t2 and faction speed mods and mwds introduce reactivation delay on mwds this encourages permamwd setups pulsing mwd is a valid and skillful tactic for maintaining range
im against the announced nerf because it goes too far for details read the feedback threadi would support a game balancing nerf of implants polycarbs and gang bonuses perhaps a general speed limit of 1215k to prevent the physics engine going crazy

rl has most scams falling under effects baised legislation insted of intent baised so someone who finds a loophole to scam can still get thrown in jail if they are working against the spirit of the law even if he did not break any rules thats all because of all the scams conrad black did in the past due to the loopholes he foundhow you going to add in effects baised legislation in eve you cannot so all you can do is gives the share trading tools to the players and keep out of the scam side even something simple as doing a rights issue would create problems is the company creating new shares to scam people or are they creating new shares with intent of giving their customers them for free and so the shares become more liquid i would like it to work but its just going to be a nestbed of scams

nice post praeanyways i agree and disagreetheres loads of us who prefer small scale pvp even if there werent lag i for one am one of those people but making large scale more appealing wouldnt hurt d
this is insane a tempest can fire as fire for as much dps as any of the other races fleet battleships at 250km there dps in practically the same if it must have a buff i think the only real argument is based upon clip size that imo tho is countered by the alpha
whatgot some numbers to support that champ because ive got some numbers that say otherwise for just a small sample see this thread and every other thread on the issue also as everybody is saying in this and many other threads alpha means damn near crap all post hpbuff and trimarkextender rigs
if you wanted it to be more like rl artilliary youd change the clip size to be equal to the amount of ammo in your hold and make the rof something like 20 seconds between shots this would reflect the guns being reloaded after every shotbut that idea is fairly stupid also as previously mentioned the dps is ok on the 1400mm but the alpha is lagging far far behind also there is the fact that the clip size is not fit for purpose when the laggy state of most fleet fights is taken into account
it helps to actually pilot the ship before making false statements like these artillery has the lowest dps of the fleet ships and the worst range a tempest needs 2 sensor booster iis with scripts to lock out about 190km whereas megathrons rokhs and apocs can all lock well above 200km some even with only 1 sensor booster artillery has the worst tracking of the bunch meaning the chances of all its rounds hitting are slim additionally artillery has the shortest range getting an optimal of about 160km with tremor and as most fleet fights are at about 180km the tempest is fighting in falloff reducing its dps even further and your comment about alpha amarr can outalpha minmatar easily with much more dps range and tracking
a variant of your ideamodern artillery systems actually fire their shells at different speeds so that all rounds from a single volly arrive at the same time why not make the arty do the same thingthe ingame behavior would looks something like your clip empties into space perhaps over 2030 seconds with no immediate effect however on the last round from the clip the damage is all calculated at once and appliedthis would have the same dps over time but would apply it in one big scary block which gives little time for shieldarmor regen
just get it so that the alpha can top 8k at least tachs will put out 6k no problem nobodys asking to be the best allaround weapongive a tempest an 8k alpha and suddenly mini bss will have a niche as best hitandrun fighters nanotempest ftw

dude you are just flat out wrongif my tempest gets 350 dps at 250 km then that means at 200km im getting 700 dps because optimal  falloff  50 hitsso my pest setup with 3 locus rigs and two tracking computers gets an optimal of 200km with 350 dps over ten shots there is no way in hell you can get 250km optimal with a tempest indeed dropping my 3 gyros for 3 tracking enhancers would only get me to 228km and give me 220 dps w00t way to fly the ship and saying that everybody performs the same at 250km so nobody should worry again shows that you are merely an eft warrior and dont know a damn thing you are talking about nobody warps a fleet to 250km and says start shooting even warping to 200km is rare most engagements are 160km  180kmok you provided tracking numbers do you know what it means bring up your eft and create a dps graph against a caracal put your tempest in there put your apoc in there and set the speed to 70 for the attackers why is the apoc insanely better in this graph it has superior range tracking and is slower meaning its aligned instawarp speed is slower than the tempests resulting even better tracking
not to mention that youre all pretty much tinkering with rather extreme ranges here and that while very much intended for fleet even battleships shouldnt be so singlepurposed or inflexible as to all fall into a universal big longrange paperweight category
artillery are a joke

non player characters that interact with poeple would be cool or even if they were controlled by ccp when they are bored or something
good ideas id love to see these implementedtoo many rig bposrig part just sit idly in my hangars because no one uses them
a great wellconsidered suggestion that would dramatically improve rigs past the old standbys of the ccc smc acr trimark purger optimization and polycarbon and a few others for specialists i dont think all the proposals you listed should be made into rigs but a lot of them are really good ideas definitely worth the thumbedit whoa i missed this part you sir are my hero
yeah its been almost 2 years now so some kind of rigs 20 patch is long overdue its boring only ever fitting like 4 different rigs most of the time to reiterate the op there are a lot that could be good but their bonus is just too marginal or theres another thats stupid not to fit instead plus it would be fun to have new rigs for things like heat jump drives nos ratio sig radius etc
i support a general revisiting of rigs by the developers with an eye towards both useless and trumpseverythingelse rigs not necessarily the specifics in the op but the concept is good
thanks for the support guys yes it is mainly the idea i am plugging not specifically any specific changes i have not put many raw numbers in and where they are only for example eg to show that you could make a warp speed rig give a ridiculously large  and it would still be balanced and might persuade someone to use one similarly with the list of proposed new rigs i split them into no balance changes might do balance changes and lol would unbalance all sorts of things for that reason  i dont think they all should be made into new rigs but i feel all of column a and most of column b at least would be super amazing hotness
awesome
bump
while i dont want to see any changes to existing useful rigs cccs anps etc i would love to see the useless rigs get improved
aka sarmaul is better than ccp as an alternate solution to the speed problem i ask that ccp considers the following solution proposed by sarmaul1 when an mwd is activated all weapon systems are deactivated and can only be reactivated once the mwd is turned off turrets drones launchers and smartbombs stop dealing damage completely while the mwd is active2 afterburner speeds are increasedthis achieves the following1 mwds are used for rapid positioning getting into a fight getting out of a fight or charging down enemies2 disengaging becomes more difficult for mwd users when you attempt to disengage by mwding away you cant kill the ceptor that is chasing you down anymore with low transversal if the tackling ship catches up to you you are in real trouble3 abs are used for fighting4 pure tackling ships can still use their mwd and tacklethis change along with some other tweaks such as nerfing polycarbons and nerfing snake implants can balance the speed problem entirely
for great justicealso 1st
mix that with reduced webs and youve got a deal
this is harsher than ccps ideaat least vagas kinda survived thenagainst
how how honestly explain this line of reasoning please under this new proposal the vagabond gets to keep its speed but loses its ability to solowtfpwn ratting ravens and the like which seems to be peoples primary beef with the shipnot to mention that this removes the need for all the other unfathomable changes like the increased mass for minmatar battleships the newfound utter uselessness of medium and large blaster ships and the forced obsolescence of interceptorsthis is the most sensible and elegant solution to a problem that was in all honesty quite limited and manageable to begin with
sign
i disagree and the vagabond is by far my favourite ship and has been for a very long timethis fixes the problems with ships such as the ishtar that were able to do more or less full damage even while running their mwdwill this make the vagabonds life harder than what it is on tq currently definitely this change especially with the web changes would be great
yes it hurts the escape prospects of a vaga facing a fleet with interceptors but if you think this plan is worse for the vaga then its obvious youve never flown one vagas already do virtually no damage orbiting with the mwd on due to tracking the ships that sarmauls proposal hurts the most are the nanoishtar and nanosac who were imbalanced due to their ability to orbit an opponent at mwd speeds while doing full damage
remember to click the support this topic checkbox if you agree 
okay i kinda like it definitely have something here
adsfsadfsadfasdasfasdwow check this outbut this idea has my support
fixes nanos without rendering ceptors and blasters useless gets my vote
sars idea is slightly more eloquent and would require less code  ship overhauling
this idea rocksand hes changing two moduleshow many ships  modules is ccp changing in this one patch oh yea all of themfire those responsible for the nano nerf and hire this guy
its balanced between reducing the uber speed yet still allowing ships that need ceptors blasterboats etc use speed good idea
i would like to see this idea tested out on sisiit still needs some tweaking me thinks but the rest of those little things will show up in testing
looks good tastes good too
supported it makes sense still leaves those who depend on their mwd to tackle to maintain their already low survivability in combat provides a strong bonus with fitting either module in 00 keeps the mwd bonus of certain gallente ships intact andandwell theres too much nifty stuff this idea handles supportedbenzy
i support this idea
one great aspect of this plan that i havent heard mentioned is that it maintains the balance of bubble camps in 00 allowing a prepared pilot to have a chance of reapproaching the gate under fire
so simple yet so effectiveshould scrams still turn off mwds
good idea only bad thing i can think of is that it would kill interceptor dog fightsmaybe interceptors get a ship bonus making them immune to the change cant really see any balance problems with that
i like ccp sarmaul imho
signed yeah yeah i know 
sounds much better than the current changes on sisi thats for sure
weirda support  this interesting and may just work would not like to lose other changes though cough assault frigate boost
pretty decent idea and much less of a sweeping change than what is currently on sisi id be willing to give it a try
its intelligent feedback like this that we all wish we could get
well it also has the advantage of obviating rather than making further adjustments to the changes currently on sisi since such sweeping changes have resulted in all sorts of unintended consequences it should be clear that the simpler the solution the better for all involvedin all fairness i do find it annoying that missiles currently have no second counter aside from ecm if defenders worked i might feel differently but point defense of some kind certainly would go a long way towards evening the odds against missile spammers in the new slower galaxy were all soon to be inhabiting
simple solution checkmakes rp sense checksolves major beefs with nano ships checkdoesnt break inties blasterships hacs fleetbubble maneuvring checkdoesnt make people regret zillions of sp or isk spent and whine for hours on forums check lets do this
lol if ccp had proposed this everyone would have been against also it would mean if you turn your mwd off in your blaster ship you need to wait till its cycle end before you can actually start firing
if mwd will become run awayget in combat module should be abit more effective
yesits a good place to start one simple change
yes yes yes yes yes gasp yes yes yesyou get the msg any but the current nano nerf
better than the sisi stuff atm p
i like the idea of making the mwd for maneuvering and the ab for combat speedi was gonna write some stuff about the other changes i like with this proposal by sarm but yeah why pollute this threadgogo maneuver drive
make mwds scripted so you can change between ab and mwd then maybe this would work thinking of intys and frigatesor just allow the max of one of each speed mod wow problem solved
i really like this solution this is an elegant fix for the speed problem and will have much fewer unintended consequences than the current sisi patch dear ccpfeel free to mix and match this proposal with specific element of the sisi patch af boost is great polycarbon nerf is appropriate snake set nerf is understandable the new warp disruptor mechanics in conjunction with the webifier nerf are great  if specific ships or modules are out of balance targeted stat changes are finejust please dont change all combat mechanics and ship stats at once fixing unintended imbalances created by the current sisi patch would keep your balance team busy for a year or more please give this alternative some thought
youre exactly right congratulations its a shame that blaster ships dont generally carry fat armorplated hp buffers because that would allow them to mistime their approach and still survive long enough to kill their tar owait not to mention that at the absolute worst thats a 10 second wait before your still highest raw dps weapons system in the game proceeds to chew through them it would require a tiny bit of finesse not quite so much as kiting at the bleeding edge of web range in an ac cruiser but stillmore seriously you might also be right that if ccp had proposed it the player base would have crapped on it as well however it still would have at least been a moderate limited change to one or two modules rather than a hamhanded sweeping overhaul of fundamental game mechanics
spaketh the truthiness has been
sarmaul is a genius cdc
against still dont really think speed is that much of a problem there is no need for this when they could just do a smaller nerf of polycarbons snakes and gang boni
sounds damn hot
this is true but it seems clear that ccp are not content with that but want to address the current overreliance on speed as well which is reasonable as is this suggestion
this is the thread for bonii seriously how many people actually think thats the proper pluralso if speed isnt that much of a problem why should polys snakes and gang bonuses get nerfed i happen to agree with you on this point its pretty clear that ccp is going to cave to the whiners in some form we might as well argue that theres a better way to do it and unfortunately smaller reasonable adjustments seem to be out of favour in iceland this idea is new enough that it might get their attention while being lowkey enough to not say render several entire classes of ships and combat tactics useless
it sucks a vaga that doesnt shoot with the mwd on is even more useless than a slow vaga tbh
oh wow wait till your corp mate dinique gets hold of you great idea though much more subtle than ccps mass nerfbat usage of reckless abandon
fixed your post heres a protip if youre orbiting a target in a vagabond and you actually want to hurt it you need to moderate your speed so that youre not orbiting at a radial velocity that exceeds the tracking ability of your gunsthis change would make it impossible to run away and shoot a tackling interceptor off you at the same time which would force you to make a tactical choice regarding the best way to extract yourself from your current situation but thats something decent nano pilots are familiar with already so it shouldnt be a problem
you mean that they know anything but how to line themselves up for the best trajectory so far i havent seen much else
this deserves to be tested with a poly and a snake nerf and nothing else to see how it holds itself upit makes more sense than a lot of stuff that makes it onto sisiccp if you have a shred of respect for players opinions regarding game mechanics you will lend serious thought to this change as an alternative to the potential overhaul you intend its simple it works it provides utility for both modules did i mention its simple and it wouldnt require the total database tweak you intendapolluon
your post proves that youve never flown a vaga or that youre just bad at it if you get in a fight the job of a vaga is often to get rid of support ships and you have to do it with the mwd on and believe me man you can track with the mwd on when flying a vaga if you do it right of coursesame discussion can be made with ships like zealots or curses you need to keep your speed up or missiles will just  you
looks good especially the bit about buffing abs also this way you dont need to screw with webs
oh but making it a useless ship is so much better amiritefully support this thread
hello i am the tracking guide i wish to inform you that after performing several calculations on a vagabond vs a 140m signature target using a 220mm aciithe best case scenario for being capable of orbiting said target outside of web range provided me with a whopping 1164 orbit at 2000msec using republic fleet emp that nets me an overall average chance to hit of only 11 with a single gun dps output of approximately 172 yes one point seven twoof course implants and overal skills were not taken into account with this and may account for the capability of actually being able to perform up to twice thats 2x that damage at twice 4000msec those speedsso to summarisefailapolluon
i love this idea
any interceptor that lets a vagabond get zero transversal on it deserves to die quite honestly your post didnt mention anything like clearing support a job that hacs in general excel at there are certainly circumstances where any ship might desire to continue shooting people with its mwd on not just the vagabond this change would entail an adjustment to current highspeed tactics yes but saying that the vagabond in particular would be useless because of it is just sillyif you really do have an indepth informed opinion something im not prepared to rule out completely then explain yourself more clearly next time so we can have a decent discussion one sentence this sux replies dont earn you much respect in this thread
flat out removing local  no
this i am open to better ideas but until i see one id say that people need to learn how to work their way around the local issue whether it be alts or just being smarter than your enemy it really isnt that hard except for the cloaking raven isk farmers but lets face it they will find another way
well boygenius how are you going to find targets if they dont show in local i dont know about you but when im roaming i dont want to have to drop scan probes in every bloody system i pass through to find something to shoot at
yeah because youll never be in 00 to use it
thats the point though there is no way to work around ityou appear in local a few seconds before you even try to load grid hence bacon and its overwhelming gayness by the time your in and scanning the ratters macro wtfever is already in warp to its ss or tower it then cloaks logs off or pos hugs for an eternity until you go awaythats completely balanced and fair isnt itoh wait its notif i needed to keep a cov ops on all roams i went on so be it whatever it takes to take the i win button everybody is so fond of using out of 00 as it stands right now you could have an army of 15 second scan cov ops with you and you will still rarely catch ratters or guys in 00 who have local open at allevery one in eve seems so up on the balance trip lately well wheres the balance there you can rat all day with 0 risk to your ship simply because you fit a cloak on a non cloaking bs or you have a tower in system what in that deserves immunity from pvpit should be work for roamers to catch you but it should be just as much work for you to avoid roamers and right now that simply is not even close to the case
it would be the biggest nerf to mining since the drone regions this lame idea benefits the agressor and the maneuverable mining is static and the vessels are achingly slow implement this idea if you want ships and mods to be 5 times more expensive
so what your saying is that just because your a miner you should automatically get a free ride and be safe from being attacked at little to no effort expended by yourself
not sure removing local and not introducing something else to the game is the best idea but in principle local needs a complete rework from the failsafe intel tool it is today
no what he is saying as a miner he doesnt want to see his risk triple and his rewards stay static make mining in 00 with the increased risk worth an increased reward so he can pay someone to watch a gate then he might give you a deal i also cannot support this issue without a substantial increase in reward to go along with the increase in risk
ya would be nice if i could move that one or two battleships with out having to pull out my freighter would be nice
anything that would make people fly amar ewar or use target painters without being the gangs laughing stock is good in my booksplease do not constraint yourselves to my original implementation i mean my real proposal is to try and make people fly in fleets of the same faction ships in order to get their bonii and penalties in line the rest was just an example of what could be so please brainstorm awaythe potential exploit where people would make four separate fleets is truly something i hadnt thought of to be honest no idea how to get around it either other than it would be pretty tough to command such a setupsure though i think it was catchy p
this is best idea ever ot how do i put in my vote for it
edit your post then tick support this topic right above your name
this sounds crazyit solves a problem that doesnt seem to existit involves a huge bonus stacking up which will inevitably lead to imbalance instead of one ship being overpowered or one tactic it would just be one entire race that entire corps or alliances would be forced to trainit screws over any small group that doesnt have universal skill training its antisandboxoh and wouldnt people just form 4 gangs with their mixedrace gang instead of oneno support this is mental
sometime you do need to put aside your analytical balance head and just go on what feels right and you got to admit those single race ships in the eve trailers do look pretty sweet look upon it as an aspiration for training that will add another factor to the equation of how to build the best fleet hell i could even design the rp tech justifications for this 
exactly a problem doesnt exist pr say but an important roleplay mechanic here does not exist if only warfare links are used then it simply makes racial command ships more efficient at giving certain bonuses that are appropriate to the storyline as well as racial ships better at receiving those bonusesmy version of the idea has nothing to do with multiple fleets  it could be in multiple wings and really bypass the mechanic but still requires organization change these to fleetonly increases and if someone can field 4 racial command ships more power to them tbqhthe idea gives an advantage to players who decide to field ships that were designed and engineered to work together ingame maybe make this mechanic only work in fw with the appropriate race so that ships with militia pilots benefited from the navy doctrine
well as analytical and numbercrunching and hardcorebalancing as i am this suggestion just appeals to me somehow not without stacking penalties for this and the command ships but with a bit of tweakrock on
yeah ccp im sure will figure out the numbers and we its not such a huge advantage just enough of a boost that it is an incentivejade youre taking this topic
yep im adding it to the august 17th meeting and will be advocating it there
hey allthough it looks interesting at first glance this is in fact worst game development idea i ever heard first of all it ignores all the things that make eve a great game freedom of choice freedom of asociation and the deliberate absence of standard god mode solutions this is an anti sand box approch and then you contradict yuorself you state at first that ppl tend to gravitate around the best solutions for the required job witch always creates a trend in the game ie nos fest nano bss damps nano t2 cruisers etc and then yuo say that the same ppl wouldnt mind chosing a bad ship that on your terms compliment a fleet why would anyone wanna be the tracking link provider in a fleet  would you fly logistics or a cov ops for 6 months on end for your corp alliance while you also have the choice of dps boats ewar etc who decides who flyies what and do you completly take the ability to chose from the individual then again you ignore the financial aspect of things for the vast majority of the eve player base making isk is a time consuming job so why would i fly for example an absolution over a geddon in a fleet when the first costs me 160 million to loose while the geddon only 40 even tho i may be the best absolution pilot in my corp skill wise  and lastly you ignor the most important aspect of all this witch is time basic specialization in a single race takes about 78 mil sps in spaceship command around 78 mil in gunnerymissilesdrones and around 56 mil in support like engineeringelectronicsmechanicscience etc so multiplying that by 4 takes you to a minimum of around 80 million sps to get all races how many characters in your corp have 80 million sps  and why would you chose over the board mediocrity over single race excellence  i could go on but i already made my point this is the worst way a game like eve could evolve zam
alternatively how cool it would be for a bunch of 4m skillpoint hurricane pilots to kick the heck out of a standard elite pvp mixed group with some good loadouts and a little minamatar single fleet leadership mojo bonus sometime you have to think cosmetic sex appeal and just how great that would look
but you supported it im actually confused but ill repeat my points just in case lolmain point  not a huge advantage just a minor incentive that makes the specialization worthwhile for mechanical and rp reasons the only argument is the following doesnt it make sense that for example minmatar ships should be better at distributing skirmish warfare linksand i love flying support ships and nobody forces me to do that if i could fly command ships thats probably going to be my main fleet ship
eat a  bob you old established people who think its all about your fun are really the only ones who stand to lose anything through a change like this and only if you refuse to adapt and reorganize oh and get a dictionaryi can agree with that but youd have to pitch the minnies something more in that caseoff topic i wonder jade have any csm members looked over any of my proposed changes to mwdsnanosmissiles vs ecmminmatar weaponsrecons etcetera i might sound selfish saying this but i honestly think that i try harder than most people on here to even things out and considering my current situation i sort of lack a lot of selfinterest in these issues while having a lot of enthusiasm for the game
if sex appeal is your main concern i can agree that single race fleets make for internet spaceship  but choice freedom ballance and the absence of standard winwin solutions are far more important for mezam
bitter muchps english is my 3rd languagepps you seem to lack a first
actually i think this would be way too powerful the stacking would have to come down hard ideally it would have the best effect on the fleet booster in a gang of racial subcapitals this restriction would make it true to the op so i propose the following addendum using minmatar as the examplecommand ship25 increase in skirmish warfare and siege warfare gang link bonus to minmatar ships when pilot is set as fleet booster4 hurricanes should be good but i dont think its the intended effect a well mixed pvp fleet with tacklers ewar and dps should be able to beat 4 bc however if two fleets have roughly the same makeup but one is all one race with a highly trained fc or booster flying a command ship it should lean in their favor

grudges aside zamol is only trying to make sure that the interests of the sandbox are protected i support the idea of making a nice incentive for single race fleets as i feel the same as some of you do that there is something inherently good about it however a compromise must be made of coursejust dont let the option of a mixed fleet become less effective by such a margin that it would cease to be a realistic choice because that would truly kill the sandbox

my bad for the double post
racial fleets in trailers do look pretty sweet agreedat the end of the day though isnt this an idea to try and promote a very specific playstyle for fleet composition now we all know from long experience that the only playstyle that will dominate gang pvp be it small or large is the one that works best it is that binary  either nobody will use it or everyone willthis gives us two situations a the proposed bonus is balanced after being d in the face by a mixed gang that can take advantage of damage types racial ecm and crossrace mixandmatching eg eos bonus on a falcon nobody will ever try to use a onerace fleet againor b the bonus given is so huge that it makes the game suck for anyone who isnt doing singlerace fleets you can say it makes a valid training goal but youre wrong what it actually means is you are forced to cross train to this corps race or abandon your longterm ingame and reallife friends this will go further until it gets to the point that you can only pick your 00 alliance if you are specced to the right place amarr spec you can pick bob or some drone region peice of  caldari spec goons or nothing etc etcit also means minor balance changes by ccp would obsolete entire alliances you wake up in the morning and youve lost three regions because today minmatar sucks if this idea is escalated i will be nearly as appalled as musical instruments
why turn this into caod  there is no reason to turn this into a forum war its just an ideai will try to answer a few of your arguments guys but please be civili have no idea how many fleet ops or roaming gangs youve been in but fcs do have a very big say on what people will bring and generally people bring what fc says at least the fleets and gangs ive been on we have people that will insist on flying recon or logistics or hac or bs they like that and they do it eve has quite a lot players to make sure that you will always have something of each class if you wishi dont understand that sorrytrue you will get 80mil sp in about 4 years of playtime i am pretty sure a lot of already 4 year old players have already crosstrained and almost all new players have a character which they intend to crosstrain in the next 4 years so what exactly is your argument  that people will have something to look for in the end game apart from the run of the mill doomsday device v character 
very legitimate worries all these i wont pretend i have answers but that doesnt mean we shouldnt work on it for a bit i mean we cant alway be afraid of how players might exploit changes or features because then we wouldnt change or introduce anything shouldnt poses or sovereignty have been introduced  because you see those have been abused to hell imhoedit as for the screwing of small corps i do have an answer i think that in fact it will easier for small low sp corps to adapt since they will have to work together on what to do next most corps have min requirements for joining if some of those turned into must fly gallente cruisers and minmatar battlecruisers it wouldnt be too bad i mean it does sound much better than just must have 5 mil sp at leastas for alliances turning all to one race i doubt it if the specs for this are released say 6 months prior to any actual changes any alliance will have time to formulate a skill plan for its members in order to be ready for it it might even give them bored cap pilots a new vision i agree it will inconvenience some players but honestly once you are past the 2030mil sp mark all you need to do is cruiser v for all races and maybe another med weapon specialization its not that bad i think and once it becomes mainstream any new player will prepare for it beforehand
push
continuation from opthis system would encourage more alliances to recruit the minersnpcers of eve into 00 these players would then feel like they can and are effecting 00 sovereignty encouraging them to come out to 00 also these players would also provide more targets to pvpers encouraging them to roam in small groups i believe this would give more purpose to smaller groups and encourage smaller gangs to roam around stopping people gaining points and reinforcing their sov the more smaller gangs roaming around also means more smaller gangs running into each other and causing smaller fights spread over many systems while this is all going on there would still be the same incentive to fight large battles over the best resourcesmoons as there is now and also if you had the ability to brute force your way in you could lock people from their assets by taking their stationsi believe this would make it a lot harder for alliances to control vast swathes of space and compress people more densely opening up a lot more space for people to exploit and find their own little niche
everytime my client crashes and my ship gets emergency warped away my drones stay where they are and getting happily killed by ratswhy cant they have some sort of ai that tells them to warp to my ship
they could either do that or make npcs immediately deagress when you get a discoloosing 5 mill in drones every time my client bugs up or some idiot in cable maintenance cuts the wrong wire is very very annoyingi never heard of drake or raven loosing 5 mill worth of launchers when they disconnected have you
agreed if you warp away by your own free will its all good and well but drones should be added to the emergency warp
nods i rarely use drones for just this reason and i never risk t2 drones anymore
drones dont have warp drives fighters do when you ewarp you go 1m km out then when you relogresync you turn around and warp 1m back the drones would have to follow you in warp out and back for this to workas much as id love ewarp retention of drones it wouldnt be supported by current mechanics theres a reason why fighters cost 15m a popthe best you can hope for is for drones to be reeled in or return to the dronebay i think
ill support this if only the drones instawarp away into nevernever land never to be seen again id just love to see someone losing a pvp battle pull a logoffski and then see their ship go one way and their drones anotherthat would be funny
instead of warping off upon disconnect the drones should make an attempt to return to the players ship before it warps offanyways i support this
if its possible to implement supported
be nice if drones at least tried to return to the ship or something
even if they just came back under my control when i relogged and came back that would help immensely but yes some solution so that a power flicker while playing doesnt cost me a rack of hammerhead iis would be much appreciated and i dont care too much what that solution is
id vote for two things in particular1 drones reestablish connections when you return to the area that way if you manually warp away and turn around you can recall them as soon as you arrive instead of scooping themone small and amusing imo exploit would be cloaking a ship deploys drones and then cloaks when someone approaches the drones to try and steal them the ship becomes visible and the drones immediately spring into action 2 drones are automatically recalled when your ship warps via dc if you happened to send them 200km out then they probably wont make it back in time but they would still try and get back before your ship aligns and warps it makes no sense that the game has a self preservation function that ignores your drones
info needs to be concentrated coz its dispersed over too many different sections now
whats the problem ccp
purpose to encourage active gameplay attempt to reduce lag and improve combat for sovereignty throughout 00 develop a solution which does not overly change current mechanics to minimize testing and implementation times problem current 00 game mechanics require large fleets to achieve goals for invading forces large fleets cause significant loads on clientserver rendering gameplay difficult due to lag logistics are required to maintain large pos networks to hold sovereignty in contested areas small corporationsalliances have little to no ability to affect 00 sovereignty outside of joining larger alliancespower blocks thus increasing the potential for unplayable server conditions proposal1 investigate significant decreases of hp for pos pos anchorables and station services purpose to mitigate large groups of pilots shooting stationary objects for excessive times excessive in this case being 20 minutes arbitrary advantage aggressor less hp requires less time to incapacitate less time required to repair advantage aggressor and defender multiple posoutpost installations could be engaged at the same time reducing the number of concentrated pilots possibly improving server conditions advantage aggressordefender if all the station services are incapacitated there is a 24 hour inactivity time for repair if all 5 are incapped more than once an additional 3 days of inanctivity time ensues before they can begin functioning up up to 7 days this would mean that outposts must be defended 1 because the hp has been drastically reduced from 80mil to  than 1 mil each and because there would be increased penalities for refusing to defend an outpost 2 investigate increasing pos fuel storage purpose decrease amount of logistic runs per tower advantage defender as with reducing the amount of time shooting stationary targets if you were to increase the amount of fuel stored for poss less time would be required to operate pos networks the ramification is that these towers would be holding more resources and their importance would increase again the goal is to increase and enhance combat not shoot stationary objects or excessively inundate pilots to haul resources3 move cynosural system jammer away from pos required anchoring location must be greater than 1 au from any outpost or anchored pos purpose decrease major fights at pos grids where lag and poor server conditions account for any percentage of destroyed ships balancing aggressor and defender capabilities 4 only 3 large towers are required for sov when anchored a check box is clicked to notate whether the tower is anchored for sov sov holder is notified when 3 contesting sov large towers are anchored and onlined this allieviates useless pos spamming and requires a straight fight for the system sov all offlined poss will unanchor themselves if not onlined after 3 days 1 full day of onliningrefueling resets the timers holding space should be primarily about profiency in combat to prevent hostiles within your area and stewardship of your facilities too long have ccp allowed massive hp buffers and ridiculous timegame mechanics to allow people to ballon space to where they would not normally be able to defend it with military prowess closing remarks these changes would allow small gangs to actively participate in 00 without overly skewing combat toward the aggressor sov holders would be less burdened by logistical runs but would be required to actively defend their possov installations affecting large nap power blocs these proposed changes would not significantly change the core gameplay mechanics potentially mitigating the possibility of bugs and other unforeseen consequences
definite steps in the right direction here  particular with cyno jammers moving away from pos and reduced hit points on attackable objects supported
the cynojammer suggestion in particular has my vote
1 supported  but only as long as pos warfare is tied to system sovereignty2 also agreed3 definitely agreed
i think if structures had a hp reduction ppl would still bring a blob to take them outmore ships  more dps  faster to take down the target  faster to finnish the jobmore ships  more targets for the enemy to defend against  more friendlies to shoot at enemies
whatever solution there is for the sovereignty problems it has nothing to do with more shootingrepping of structuresitll not encourage fights any more than current status as people will still bring a blobwhy because they dont risk loosing ships theninvent something that makes people want to shoot each other in small groups insteadnot supported
so kerfira where are you getting the idea that this is suggesting more shooting of structures wouldnt reducing the hps of them just mean less shooting off structuresid be interested to hear what you think a good way to get small ship combat into the sov equation would be but i dont think youre actually reading any of these proposals because your comments are consistently off the mark
good start
exactly tarminic keep all the old rules with large towers and the whole sov system intact just tweak it to see if a moar dynamic battle is better for everyone from small alliances to the megaalliances shift the emphasis away from time consuming shooting stationary target thus repping those targets and endless fueling runs and moar time shooting and strategic planning if you give people the ability to affect assets all over an alliances sov space that is doing something if there are no station services then you cant do anything sitting in station which provides you more incentive to go out and fightmore gunners at towers mean more people are doing more things with what we already have nobody has to invent new unusual or useless mechanics to drive combat the impetus for combat is to affect other people i would envision a wide range of new buisness oppertunities for mercenaries as small gangs can go around affecting pos installations in 00 and in empire of course people will still have the option to blob nothing short of strict traffic controls will prevent that but the catch here is that if moar can be done with less who is really going to sit around and wait 2 hours for people to show up when they can go out and get stuff done themselves
1 and 2 i can support but 3 is going overboard there are more conventional and technically feasible ways to nerf cynojammers than that which will be more balanced for both attacker and defender anyway
i can digest this one a bit easierhave no real input about 3 except maybe adding a bops role to possibly take it out
reading that wall of text was bad enough so having not read any other posts this idea is terrible all this talk about not requiring numbers to do stuff so that small corps can do stuff in 00 is dumb doing these things may not require many people but you will lose to the person who brings 2 or 3 times as many assets with cap supporttldr blobbing is impossible to fix unless you limit the number of people in an area someone else will always have more cannon fodder people
the war is not broken it does not require fixing the ways we wage the wars are not set in stone the give and take is all in the creativity and tactical planning of the corporations and alliances engaging in them these proposals to completely revamp 00 combat are unneeded were going backwards herethe gates idea is just wrong if anything else if people want to own a gate they have the ability already sit on it with a gang done if anything is to be discussed for revamping intergalactic warfare it should be streamlining the system that is in place before going in a completely different direction what youre talking about is like building a kit car for say an old muscle car and then half way through when its almost ready to run you decide youd rather have an exotic sportscar kit but instead of finishing what you had and then adding something else thats cool to the collection you just start throwing crap from the exotic car onto the muscle car in the end you end up with something ugly that barely works if it does when you could have had the most solid muscle on the blocklayers is the name okay we have layers of functioning material thats got a few wrinkles iron it outsmall gang pvp being compared to capital large scale engagements im not sure youre playing to much anymore if you want to get in a gang with a bunch of rifters and go have a good time you can if you want to get into a badger with smartbombs for kicks you can if you want to have 100 rifters fight 100 merlins this can be achieved as well the layers you were yapping about are in place only theyre more accurately called roles and each ship has one and each object in the space our ships roam in has one too frigates are designed for small gang operations logistics harassment and tackling the player has more than enough option to stay in a frigate for their entire stay in eve and enjoy it the roles of capital ships are to fight in large scale operations look at concord on a gate frigates ewar logistics battleships cruisers battlecruisers each ship has its rolefor every playerpilot there is a goal for every shipgame mechanic there is a role focus on making the system in place shine then see what accessories and remodles should be done because there are a lot more complaints about minor stuff then there is the entire system
since it seems this discussion is still going on ill reply in large scale combat it is true that most every ship can fulfill a role but thats not what ccp asked that the csm address ccp specifically called for a layered model of 00 sovereignty warfare that includes territorial objectives for small subcapital gangs in addition to capital and fleet objectives that is what the op providesthe assertions many of you are making about what this proposal entailed are flat out incorrect nothing in the op hands 00 sovereignty over to small empire alliances or nonsense like that it simply restructures how the existing sovereignty benefits are granted so that some remain governed by pos some are governed by nonpos structures designed to be assaulted by large fleets and some are governed by large numbers of distributed objectives in this case stargates designed to be conquered by many small groups acting in concerti appreciate that some feel the current system works fine but ccp didnt ask that question they said they want to change it and this has to be viewed in that context
all that needed to be done to revamp 00 sov was to lower hp across the board and increase fuel bay capacity and possibly move cynojammers away from pos towerslag is the death in all fleet fights lag comes from large gangs large gangs come from the necessity to shoot mindless objects for long periods of time everything must be done to limit lag and boredomif you reduce pos hpanchorablesstation services there is less to take down less time to rep it back up more targets can be hit at the same time requiring moar attention paid to your home systems and valuable pos installations moar time at home means failure alliances wont be able to napfailtrain all over the place because they might be hit next you increase the fuel bays to reduce logistic runs which are boring but providing moar assets and isk into each toweryou move the cynojammer away from teh tower and it becomes a becon of contesting this negates lag for being on the side of the defender as it is now with the pos getting free kills to desynched pilots with this no major changes to sov need to take place 00 becomes a constant battle ground all is good
please write up your proposal as an issue matrixcvd and ill support it and add it to the agenda once its stood for 7 days deadline for public discussion prior to august 17th meeting means youd need your issue post up on the assembly hall by sunday 10th 1600 hours at the latest
it seems to me that an alliance holding enough territory should be able to disallow any ships specified or generally out of their alliance not possessing the right signaturescodes from using stargates that are deep enough in their space or secured by some other means the only ability to circumvent this would be through either hacking a gate or by using covert jump bridgesor hell you could simply introduce passcodes yay for infiltrationspying opsgenerally though your original suggestion is excellent and i am all for this
i read 13bad idea after bad idea sounds like faction warfair on stargatesboring
done
support
no it becomes an even more constant shootrepairstructuregroundwhatever solution there is for the sovereignty problems it has nothing to do with more shootingrepping of structures itll not encourage fights any more than current status as people will still bring a blobwhy because they dont risk loosing ships theninvent something that makes people want to shoot each other in small groups instead
ok as far as i know this is somewhat dead unless jade and co decide to circumvent everyone and force it upon ccp anywaybut if ccp and everyone else wants to create layers putting layers of crap on a issue to compound the problem makes no sense when someone calls an op no one says oh we just need a few guys you get what you get and run with it and make it up as you go along there are already small gang stuff going on anyway enhance that we have already been addressing the bops issue put that in place with the layers stuff ccp want bops in it self if a layer incorporate that attacking ones infrastructure is not hitting gates and the like the true life blood is the pilots small gangs are designed to disrupt day to day null sec life you will do 100 times more damage killing a jump freighter or killing a few miners and ratters than you will ever do taking down a pos or assaulting a gatethat is a layer both tactical and rp it already exists this is contesting your targets military prowess and infrastructure not shooting a structure enhance what we have that works currently fix or minimize the boring  and then build upon that building a house on a pile of  just makes a bigger pile of 
im just pointing out what ccp asked for there may be plenty of small gang stuff to do in 00 but they wanted small gang stuff that affected sovereignty a lot of folks who had a problem with this didnt understand that contextas for the its always better to blob argument heres the element youre missingmore pilots is better except when the additional pilots could be more useful elsewhere thats how you break up the blob  you give them diminishing returns on their pilots beyond a certain point and give them a more efficient way to use those additional pilots on another gridin my proposal you need 10 pilots to capture a gate but after 10 you dont capture the gate any faster maybe you bring a few extras as backups but once you get into the 2530 pilot range you have to start asking yourself if its not better to run two gangs at the same time in order to capture twice as many gates in the same amount of time you have devoted to the op thats one way to disincentivize blobbing and its a sound principle but one that many didnt seem to get
here is the part you are ignoring or not getting players do not want to shoot structures shooting structures suck its boring players do not even think about those only if they have to and then its pretty muchmehand trying to enforce a set number of players to do anything is restricting game play and to think that we can sit here and theory craft tactics for any one group to follow is silly ccp should not dictate how tactics are played out we as player set that standard that is why we see so much failure amongst alliances because bob or someone else slams them with something they do not expect or using tactics on the field they came up with that allows players to be creative making someone do something by some set of number of players to contest an objective is pretty much 2 dimensional board game thinkingmake the bops proposal with he ability to bring in enough ships and dps to to attack the cyno jammers you have surprise tactics and contesting sovyou dont have to have an over complicated micro managed 3 layer system just keep it simple to allow the players to choose what they will and will not do do not put more structure warfare in the game make the current structures much more vulnerable requiring more player response to defendand you still missed the point of what the real infrastructure of any alliance or crop is its the pilots they are who you attack
i agree with that but theres no more shooting at structures in this proposal than there currently is in game  how is your complaint relevant to this proposali dont think this is a valid argument at all the nature of every module and mechanic in the game has an impact on tactics nothing ive laid out locks a group into a particular set of tactics in fact it provides the framework for a variety of methods the choice to make a freighter an easy target if unescorted prompts players to use scouts and escort ships  is it valid to complain that this is shoehorning players into a particular tactic of course not likewise with any other game mechanic currently in this game or any other  the basics are laid down and players adapt around themi agree but in territory warfare you also take over territory this model gets more pilots into the field where they can attack and be attacked by one another as opposed to just making single heavy excursions or incursions to construct or siege a pos this adds a broad pilot presence across the held territory in addition to that making held and contested territory more populous
by dictating the number of and the type of ships needed to take anyone objective is constrictive and unrealistic this is dictating tactics you are telling them you have 4 choices pick one ok this is whats going to happen some naivete pilot believing that this is what they have to do will form a gang just as you spelled out now the response force to agrees said attacking team trying to take that gate is going to get swarmed because they are going to cta and every body and their brother will show up boil into the system the attacking team has been given the high hard one with out a reach around the attacking team is going to say screw this i am either going to show with a fleet next time or just go harass the rattersyou might get ohh maybe 3 or 4 days of teams actually following that ship requirement before you have blob wars on gatesi see what you are doing you are creating a method to solve a problem but it has not solved it just created more hurdles and drawn out the game play you are trying to put your self in the place of alliance leaders as stating this is what i would do and this is what ccp wants by putting layers on something that is boring pos warfare just means that it is 3 layers of boring
i dont think saying you need 10 ships of any size to effect a gate capture is any more restrictive than needing dreadnoughts to take down a pos or a battleship fleet to eliminate a cynojammerif the attack can field enough ships to divide their forces one group can capture gates while another distracts the defending blob etc then the defender will have to respond by distributing their forces better to counter the multiple small gangs the attacker is fielding i could see an attacker counterblobbing if they felt they could destroy a defending force outright and gain increased freedom to continue contesting gates but a savvy commander might choose to evade the defending blob in order to contest more gates if he is outnumbered but the mechanics are there to give incentives to field multiple forces instead of a single blob

this was actually a pretty interesting thread until this pompous cockprat showed up with this goons ate my baby nonsense he ctrlvs into every thread he can its a shame this forum doesnt support discussion better there were some interesting ideas here that merited some debate
you refused my offer hereand still claim its not practical to tank a hulkyou dont have enough experience or skill to figure it out on your own seems like a pretty straightforward conclusion
lets be clear shall we i refused the terms of the offer you made if you can prove me wrong then do so please prove me wrong right here on these forums in front of everyone heres your big chance so do iti still say there is no practical way an active present and awake instead of afk solo miner can tank a hulk so that it will survive a competent solo suicide attack defined as a single aggressing ship which does not exclude the use of a second alt controled ship in the role of cov op andor bumper in 07 or below thats a little different than your twist on my words its not practical to tank a hulk see the difference thereit is impossible to prove something does not exist see proving a negative your task on the other hand is simple you claim something does exist and you say you have the means to prove it so do it seems pretty straightforward and simplein the interest of fair play ill even define what i mean by practical a tank fit which does not do one or both of two things1 fit a hulk with items that are absurdly expensive to do so is an unreasonable hardship on a miner as it compells himher to spend huge sums of isk to simply survive in high sec also it paints such an enormous kill me sign on hisher hull that the tank will fail to suicide attacks simply because those attacks will now come from multiple attackers instead of a solo attacker2 fit a hulk in such a way as to cripple its primary purpose which is to gather ore in an efficient manner if youre going to do that you may as well use another type of shipsay a battleship for mining you wont be getting what a hulk is designed for anyway and a battleship tanks easier and better of course then you wont be mining ice either but if youre mining ice in a hulk which has had its capacity for mining crippled youre promoting afk mining and thats not active miningso why should anyone listen to you if you wont prove something you say you can why should anyone believe you have the competence you claim if you wont prove it as you so easily should be able towindjammer
ive seen weirder things and some people just forget to sign even if their posts say they almost completely agree
i agree this area needs some attention
you only hear about the nerfers whine about the existence of local while you dont hear the people who like having local i believe these people make up the silent majority i aint talking about carebears wanting safety im talking about the vast majority of pvp guys who dont want yet another grindelongation before pvp to occurpvp is already unconsensual anywherewe already have to find the target by warping to stations asteroid belts moons planets probe missions sitesnow some people want us to not even know if the target is system you know who these losters are nanofreaks and carebears who are already used to grinding they dont mind pressing on the scanner continually and being aligned and all that wussy crapwe the ordinary decent criminals do not want a nerf on local in fact we want it boosted we want the list compressed so we dont have to scroll up and down as much remove the portrait icons use the color to highlight the entire nameshow you support dont let the 00 farmers get their wish
not signed at allhow often do the people in high sec rely on local compared to the ones in 00  i can garantee that 00 uses it 1001000 times more well this has all changed with fw i suppose but regardless i think every pvper in this game will agree this game would actually be fun again if there was no local the element of suprise not knowing the sneaking pastthrough hostile territory gawd this game would rule
if you dont consider yourself a carebear saying that then its obvious youre lost alreadyive pointedly not gotten with the nanogotry because i like to keep my balls a bit when it comes to combat i like strategy and tactics in equal amounts and i enjoy surprising people aggressively because i believe in the ability of interceptors and recon ships i believe in the cloak i believe that one shouldnt have to exploit this game to win and that easy kills are unsatisfying easy mining is unsatisfying having an unreasonably easy time making loads of cash and influence at all is unsatisfyinglocal is broken a communication channel that is used as a poor alternative for a detection device instead it needs to be removed both for game balancing and rp reasons
why dont ppl see alternative solutions introduce something else instead to chat with which doesnt need to show whos in system unless you chose tothe problem is that a chat channel is used to see whos in a system and thats not its intended use i breaks with immersion too its a chat channel not a scanning device
this might actually be quite successful its a convenient system that allows people without credit cards to contribute to a worthy cause vastly increasing the potential market for donors furthermore since this isnt real money were dealing with in practical terms at least people might just donate more than they would normallyone criticism i have of your idea dont make it a monthly thing only do the occasional oneoff donation drive for a particular cause for best results hold some kind of event like a mini tournament  incursus jousting 1v1 fights in incursus to give an example  and the charity gets the proceeds of the event plus any supplementary donations from players this should open the gates wide for corporate sponsorship just like in the real worldthis may be the first charity donation initiative brought about by ingame currency trading nb incursus is fourth declension so its plural is also incursus
signed
would be nice
how could this possibly be a bad idea it would allow people that dont have that much to give a way to givefictional worlds having an direct impact on the real world i love itsupport not that the csm or ccp will do anything with this but still
wow cause likes most charities its fake and used for money laundering
id be all for it1
now this is creative thinking unlike this nonsense
im sorry but i dont understand what you mean thanks but you didnt select the support this topic checkbox when you posted so it does not officially count in regards to sending it to the csm if you have a chance you can just go back and edit the post to add it
i definitely support this idea
that is a very clever idea and would be pretty amazing pr for eve
creative and simple the mark of a brilliant ideaif you add in things like the alliance tournament the possibilities to raise a good level of rl cash extremely credible
a sound idea that deserves the support of all well done uiliam
fantastic idea think of the positive publicity ccponly thing i would say is who gets to choose the charity
would love to see something like this implemented
i like the concept but some care would be needed when working out the details of exactly how to implement  especially when it comes to picking charities to supportdefinately should be looked into though i think
sure why not gives us all a good answer to cihys im donating it to charity
one thing i think i missed and could be altered to make it more of a community donation and less of a ccp direct donation is for the card to be resold by ccp for money rather than it impacting their profitsbut at the end of the day the strict detail isnt that important only that theres a way to convert isk into a charitable donation
i know what i hate and i dont hate thissure 1 everyone wins charity gets  ccp gets writeoffs and players well get to feel good about themselves or something i would imagine
this could be a very cool thing for ccp to do and it could be used to support this
yep good idea ill raise it at the next meeting consider it on going on the agenda once the 7 day public discussion is up
my concern is that this might fry the gtc market by creating a massive new demand with no new supply prices will certainly spike that said im still in favour of this  a good idea and good publicity besides but be aware that youre going to dramatically change gtc prices if you do this also instead of picking one charity ccp should set up a pile of them a pile of dummy characters with names like ccp charity childs play specifically with 3 word names if its possible to do that because players cant replicate those who each check their wallets every downtime and buy gtcs if they have the cash on hand to do so
i like iti got 7 bill with nohting to buy p
sir you are a genious wait a second wtf for a moment there i thought i had entered some other weird magical dimension i think it might have been yoursyoure really going to go with that huhfacepalm
like tards wow this is honestly the stupidest idea ive heard in a good few weeksfirst off they nerfed dictors  to the point where around 7080 of the dedicated pilots stopped flying themcheap not really i can tellin gyou right fing now my implants arent cheap either you expect me to constantly die while trying to tackle people for you or is it you kept dying by dictor bubbles cause you guys couldnt think of a productive counter against dictors which nowadays with their speed nerf is a nano thorax s  or you engaged in a drake blobyou have issues dictor have received the shortest end of the stick next to arazus latelygo back to high sec if you don twant to deal with themyou failnot supportedsorry that thread actually made me angry cause of its stupidity
agreed pilgrim should have the range bonusnot a drone bonus tho yesi can fly pilgrimp
i dont care what people say the pilgrim is and should be a sneak attacker meant to operate within 10 km range as it is today it has not only lost 200 armor hp recently for no evident reason and possesses unreasonably few slots compared to hacs but it also features an ewar ability that people are very conflicted and hesitant toward using it has not a single solo advantage except the cloak over its faster more wellarmored and superiorranged sibling the curse and that cloak only allows it to sneak up on t1 noob pilots miners or unlucky ratters like a scavenger because no sensible pilgrim pilot will ever engage hacs or battlecruisers or battleships up close in solo combat even though these ships could arguably be called its main prey making it a greatly frowned upon and despised ship and in fleet combat it lacks so much as an active role furthermore it has a pointed weakness against both smartbombs and missileswhatever can be done to strengthen the pilgrim which in my mind is preferably to give it more defense especially against missiles and more firepower though preferably not from having to resort to heavy drones should be done
welcome to the drone regions where the ratters produce more minerals than miners can ever mine about the gsc must say i find it inventive but no option for 00 mining for the reasons i posted before tanking spawns
dude you have my support though i did not mine now for years the risions exact what you have discribedand to ppl who are think miner is not solo profesion  you have no idea 
you have one person supporting you think about that
there is quite a bit of support in this area actually so only one in this thread doesnt mean squat mining could use some improvements doesnt mean it should make more isk per hour but it could use an overhaulwhile i might not subscribe to exactly what the op wants i do agree that mining is underdeveloped as a profession
so this is a small idea i have had bouncing around my head right now the only real reason to chose an particular race is to get the jump on a few skills that races use and minmaxing your traits why not give each race a bonus to use the ships of that race it would give you an added incentive when choosing one race or another some exampleswant a great armor tanker maybe if you chose amarr you get bonuses to your armor resists whenever flying amarr shipswant a flying scrap heap maybe if you chose minmatar as your race you get a bonus to your missile  projectile skills to make those split weapon ships a bit mroe viable this of course would only be in effect when flying minmatar ships of coursewant a fleet of angry drones maybe give gallente pilots added drones in flight when flying gallente styles ships ala guardian vexorwant the massive force of missiles on your side maybe give caldari bonuses to their missile systems they are already fairly strong given they dont really miss so possibly add to the shield tanking when in caldari ships or the hybrid guns so more caldari use guns of course only when in caldari shipsi think this would help with people who want to specialize it would also make newer players feel a bit more useful when flying the ships they chose a race for it would make minmaxing a bit less viable it would also add a bit more realism for faction warfarethis idea was brought to you in part by the letter sregardsstabby
s for sucks
so far there is nothing biotech about eve and even if there were all the races are humanso the only thing youre choosing between amarr and gallente is your characters upbringing they started out learning lasers or drones because thats what the society focused onbut a japanese man wont drive a toyota better than an american unless he knows how to drive better and those same two individuals wont trade places when they switch from that toyota to a chevyeves item usage has always been about equality based on training a gallente spec ops starts with a lot of drone training but that doesnt mean that a caldari miner couldnt still take those same skills and perform just as wellso sorry no vote from me ships dont work better just because of your blood or heritage
a majority of the csm doesnt support my horrible and transparent efforts to turn 00 into factional warfare so i can be a power im going to post in every thread about it like a big baby
when there is a nano nerf in game to address ill be happy to for now ccps asked for player input on what they have in testing if you want to have an impact id recommend testing and providing feedback rather than blaming the csm for something thats not its place to address ccps given you the outlet for this angst use it ing about the csm instead of following the proper course will get you nowhere and leave only yourself to blame
that does not compute there is no high or low votes stop trolling goon this is not sa
not a troll i think there is definitely a level of prioritization that will occur regardless if it is specifically outlined in the csm guidelines it has been mentioned numerous times by delegatesalso im not a member of sa figure that out before you make another assumption then shut up
that is completely correct ccp wants us to do a prioritization of all the issues thus theres the 2 factors to considershould the issue be escalatedyesnohow important is the issuelowmediummediumhighhigh
really when did goons abolish membership of something awful as a mandatory requirement for joining goonfleetas for bringing personal agendas to the table id have a lot more respect for any csm member if they brought up a cause theyve championed for a long time prior not some spur of the moment brainfart they concocted during their last bio break
since you could be sponsored entrapment is way more fun than trolling look how dumb you look
thats exactly what i thought when i read the title
sounds cool
thanks for the support guys
i support this idea but there is other aspects of the ccp idea that need to be considered like the boost to assault frigs viability i been on test server trying out the new assault frig stats and now assault frigs with scram and ab are actually viable in combat they are able to disable targets mwd with a scram and orbit them fast enough to reduced incoming dps even while webbed i actually want to spend the money on and assault frig now cause it wont die as soon as it is webbed understand with your idea in place and some of the ccps ideas in place it will make a good combination also boats that are designed to use any close range gunnery and mwd should have a resistance to the mwd disabling scram not sure how exactly but i think that nerfing blaster ships is a huge hit to gallente race so not sure how ccp thinks that they are evening things out in my opinion they should leave base stats of webifier alone and give certain ships bonus to web resistance as well as slow broken speed ships down no reason to have a battleship going over 35kms with hgsnake and deadspace mwd bumping capital ships with a battleship is rediculous considering the force of the impact would most like destroy both ships in reality i dont know if any of this makes sense i hope so good luck with this idea
yea assault ships pwn now  i just d a zealot in my jag using that tactic on test server i agree that other aspects of ccps idea need to be added too personally i would give afs a web resistance id give the pilgrim the same range as the curse and id increase the lachesis and arazus damp bonus from 5 to 10and also with this equation these stupid speed battleships arent useable a mach can only do around 25kms tops now
now youre talking at laststill i think that more of a general speed reduction for missiles too but not as much and introducing some alternatives for ecm to affect missiles would be good its more and less drastic measures all together that will balance the game out instead of tip the scales forth and back and forth and backalso machariel going at 25 kms is still wtfbbq
na i doubt anybody would fly one that went that slow lol too easy to catch and not exactly cheap 
well maybe but only for as long as everyone flies drakes and sacrileges fck thatcombatwise though its still way too dramatic a speed i personally want to see tactics that does not include everyone with an mwd being able to fly around and be everywhere in a fleet battle or mess things up in a 1v1 so damn easily you should have to think and plan
it was always unclear to me why jukebox in eve doesnt support playing music tracks from users own computer it shouldnt be that hard to implement it a simple add track and remove track buttons should be enough and some basic changes to the game client the only problem could be if ccp used some file type unkonown to the rest of the world to record their tracks in that case the jukebox change would require a slight change in the source code to support some of the most used file types mp3 would be great but i think its not entirely free for commercial use theres also the oggvorbis ogg format which is a good opensource solution with equal or even better quality than mp3 and there are many converters to and from ogg format maybe there are other things that does not allow this to be implemented that easily but on the other hand if it is simple why not implement it
we know thats why its awesome
hel ya i support thisthe base bonus to pitch is the defining factor for the naglfari would go so far as to suggest that they leave the current bonus and simply change the base attributes of the minmatar carriers so that they share this defining distinction with their dread
this huge boner has my attention
yes
well you wanted concrete  ill give you concrete i will start from the general and go down to the specific category by categoryappearanceas it is now since the implementation of the new engine eves colours have had a change for the less dark the rust green dominix has become flourecent blue the thanatos has turned from dark and green to blue and greenish etc  in general the ships have very polished surfaces particularly amarr and have an almost plastic toy sense to them compare the clean surfaces of the premium content to the classic in regards to minmatar ships for instance the designs that have developed over the years seem to be more and more average scifi than typical eve look at your average concept art from eve over the years look at the colours the dead lands the almost postapocalyptic feel to it the cyberpunkesque inspirations and compare it to what we have today a polygonal marvel im sure but not enough grit and too much look at this plastic toycombatit seems that war has little consequence when ships are easy replenished and battleships are as commonplace as cruisers were three years ago people talk a lot of gamebalance here and there and less about economics managing a vast empire should be very costly and having everyone flying around in battleships let alone dreadnoughts and carriers seems odd i think personally that its time to remove all insurance payouts on battleships and above losing your whole fleet in combat should sting a bit more especially if you brought capitals same thing in regard for pve whats the challenge of mission content if everything is predictible if you know exactly what to fit your ship with then whats the point you might as well give people continuous ticking isk because adapting to these predictible missions is nowhere near full of consequences personally i think there should be more of a significant impact you accept a mission your agent counts on you to complete the task without always being able to provide accurate intel how many movies have we seen where intel was shot to hell there should be more risk to the missions but even more so there should be complete random components in a mission warping in a passive drake to tank an entire level 4 mission while grinding away the rats is a pointless task and makes for dull unchallenging pve true the rewards are mostly pitiful  but i think there needs to be less predictability in these situationsi also think there needs to be more ways beyond the social to disrupt corporations that dont own pos in empire wardecs are very onesided ways of hurting corporations i wish to see more mechanisms in the game where you can target a corporation and use your influence and contacts to force them into bankrupcy i think there should be more bills more costs and also more profits involved with player corporations more reward to leading a corporation giving it more life but also more ways of disrupting it bribing agencies and sabotaging stocks naturally everything has consequences sabotaging it for someone has security hits etcdocking radiuses gonei think that undocking a ship from a station should be like jumping through an unscouted gate once youre finally in control and stations controls release you you are far away from the station and can either warp off or turn your ship and request redock no more hi im an invulnerable capital ship sitting on an undock you want that advantage youre going to have to take risks too same goes for haulers lone pvpers etcnew means of highsec dominanceclearly the police shouldnt be incorruptible but there should be more ways of telling the police to look the other way than just simple war declarations with 24 hour timers for instance being able to bribe your way to do something similar to that movie make a gate clear of police for a period of time naturally if its well populated areas its going
appearance  this is personal preference maybe switch back to classic for your old skins but this is less of an issueremoving insurance  i wouldnt mind this so much personally i wonder how much money the scc loses each monthpve  takes a lot of content and some players like the grind disrupt them by warping in their mission and it wouldnt be bad if the rewards decreased compared to more hostile iskmaking mechanicscorporations  in a free market economy with perfect competition in most basic items at trade hubs it is impossible to really destroy any corp through bribery or stock manipulation especially if they only manufacture and dont sell their stock most of this can be done but requires infiltrationdocking games  tough to solve and being able to look outside station is more realistic there really isnt a mechanic that can fix this considering the strict boundary between combat outsideno combat inside and the ability to sit on that boundaryhisec dominance  disagree here actually concord should be completely incorruptible for rp reasons otherwise the major factions would have tried to gain influence they have to be completely neutral otherwise major player alliances would be able to have their own police squad imo any change to this destroys the entire concept of high seccant support because too broad nullsec is the dark place but empire must at this point be safer for new players although i wouldnt be opposed to a new server with a completely 00 galaxy god thatd be amazing
do you honestly see the csm wasting their time with this much less agreeing on this
appearance  personal preference yes stations look fine as is but when it comes to ships we want to be able to customize appearances somewhat i know that i at least will be flying something looking like a rust hulk propelled by nuclear fireremoving insurance  not really but lessening it is a good idea to drive on the economy hopefully scale down the larger older alliances in comparison to the younger corps because they lose more money and regulate highsec ganking not that im entirely against the latter its just that there are reasons for highsec space and you shouldnt be able to fck someone over without a reason and that easily without paying for it pve  i havent ever liked anything but highlevel grind myself and that only occasionally to try and get angel missions so that i can hold on to them and salvage trit bars for starting capital the grind has its place but riskier stuff should be more profitable so we need to tone down mission money but not lp better mining options and definitely better pvp policing and ransom optionscorporations  it seems that the only way to really take corps out of the game is to either tire them out let them tire themselves out i mourn mc or infiltrate and ruin them istvaan shogaatsu you bastard you admirable marvelous prick should this really be the casedocking games  station windows are a necessity and come off as rather evident and natural even if this mechanic ought to be looked over of course and it should be even harder once you take ambulation into accounthisec dominance  it irritates me to say this but concord does need to be largely or completely incorruptible for the purpose of roleplay and even more for the sake of the economy there are war declarations and other mechanics to get to people in hisec and hisec exists for a reason faction police forces is another cool suggestion though  something with more organization and intelligence than the regular pilot force for territorial defense purposes this ties into making eve darker and colder having to organize things because of more gate routes less gatecamping potential and hopefully the removal of local channellocal channel  boot this ships should have a maximum detection range and chance depending on their sensor strength with the ability to warn their pilots of incoming ships for realism and balancing reasons but you certainly shouldnt have to reveal yourself when simply entering a system unless you announce yourself in local even nonhostile t1 ships should be able to slip through a system without some belting pilot noticing even without intending it
yes i do
you mean instead of actively voting to diminish the cold and dark ambience by implementing avatars playing musical instruments yeah youre probably right troll
re pvecurrent structure and mechanic of missions is such that if you made missions have random rat types damage types etc you would make using a cs or hac obligatory for l3s and a couple of bses for l4 with the mechanic of pve being use mission specific hardeners pray your tank holds as you are not always achura and not always in a drake  making damages and rats random would increase mission difficulty very very much and if missions remained current fly to 50 immensely stupid rats kill them all go back to agent you would just increase difficulty without making them truly 1 more interestingre undockonly only and only if you get to see whos on the grid outside station windows access to your ships scanners station bulitens but you would only be creating free isk for pirates if you removed current undock mechanics and not gave any new way of seeing is anyone waiting in ambushjumping trough a stargate into a different solar system is a bit different that undocking from a spacestation
well im not amarr but i like that they shine in gold it works with gallente i like most of the tristan color scheme but still i feel that their ships really dont match the design of gallente in the long run tristan has nothing in common with for example hyperion and the motherships look odd they look like completely different races vexor looks like a sheephead and single mass minnies look similar to style but just have different kinds of ships caldaris also have somethat same design but its sometimes a bit faultybut they are ugly
notice how the level headed delegates stated that they had no reason to say no to music in ambulationas apposed to these insane game breaking ideas
tzujeih you really are the worst poster get outalthough i may not agree with all the specific ideas in the ops second post a commitment to keep the ambience and ethos dark and dirty is by no means game breaking
mehsounds like another wahh i want more newbs to gank troll post to methe game should be fun to play not like being gang d in a back alleyno support thumbs down
obviously something like this need to be worked through and im not the person to do it however the bottom line is that the hardcore aspect of eve is on the verge of being compromised and i believe this needs to be addressed
and i think youre being a hypocrite for thinking only in 1v1 and small gang warfare and pretending youre not being selfconvenient yourself stuff that works in 1v1smallgangs might not work in 30v30 fleet fights and as it stands right now factional warfare is mostly fleet fightsand if a scorpionor any other long range missile boat is lobbing cruise missiles at you you wont have the time to warp out before the first volley hitsthe module is situational i know but so is every other electronic and ewar module but by giving other roles to ewar through the use of scripts you end up generalizing them more
i dont see the points youre trying to make anymore at all not everyone is into factional warfare and as far as i can tell this alternate use of ecms doesnt break anything but simply adds some more gameplay elementsare you trying to argue in favor of the missile boats or the missile defensesand this is not about generalizing ewar its about implementing something that exists in real life helps with the nano issue both on the nerf and nonnerf sides and diversifies the game by making ewar more useful without actually making it more powerful and adding more of a fleet role to eas and recons
is it topic about upcoming nano nerf or lets make nerf missels againseems more as second one to me
that you only seem to be thinking ofbe in favor of gangs of more than 5 ships we dont need more thinking like that than we already do with the huge alliances at presentwell then we should be on the same page cept you seem to be taking this pretty aggressively thing is though that missiles will be turning fearsome with the patch and have too few and ineffective counters when they have no cap cost and no chance of actually missingyes what are you trying to prove as ive already said youd have to specialize in order to defend against missiles stop ignoring me and start thinking damnitor are you saying that for example all interceptors are the same because they are all fast low on firepower and have bonuses to webs and scrams that force recons generalize and are all the same because theyre supposed to make points for covert cynos jumps that they are all the same because they all have a cloak cause thats how far you seem to go with this generalization talkcome on your missiles would still be effective cause anyone in their right sense of mind with a regular cruiser wouldnt bother mounting a system like this because itd be too weak because it would be better for them to rely only on armor shields or speed only a scant few cruisers eas and recon ships would even be able to specialize themselves at defending against missiles and even then at the cost of directly targetingdisablingtaking out specificsingle shipsbut then again why am i even arguing with you at this point judging from your comments and suggestions not to mention your race its more likely than not that youre just a bit conscious of and pssy about your upandcoming hamdrake losing its ability to take out any and all ships and thus you figure that suggesting a module that only takes away a fraction of the power of your missiles while having to be mounted in a highslot and cutting the oppositions potential firepower is the way to go greatits about nerfing nanos correctly cutting out the mwd cancer and keeping missiles effective but not teh UFFFDber once the speed nerf goes through since i see a lot of people training for drakesravens in the future
1 i dont use drakes2 i dont fly anything bigger than a cruiser the only times i did were when i was in fw3 using modules is a sacrifice if you want to defend against something you make a compromise of something else
do you want me to put it in moronspeak alright if you want the missiles not to hit you you would have to stop being able to jam scram or disrupt other things if you put these scripts in you cant change them while flying you will have to dock and change your loadout which means that using these things would give you penalties comprende fUFFFDrstUFFFDr du verstehen sie
then wouldnt it be better to make a new module instead of confusing everyone with your magic scripts that dont work like scripts or some suchi understand my comprehension skills are not perfect but maybe you should think your idea through so they make sense to someone else but yourself
right now if you want to buy a shuttle you have to plough through the market screen interface to find a seller at your station or work your way through the browse section if youre pinching pennies youll probably want to compare prices of other races shuttles though you need to be really poor to warrant thati suggest we get rid of all that with some kind of buy shuttle button which would appear in the station ui itll automatically peruse the market orders for the things and find the cheapest available at the station  or tell you if there arent any available ideally itll compare all four races to find the best price in practice i it could work similarly to the buy this type function when you rightclick a sellable objectnb for simplicitys sake shuttles would still be traded normally via the market this is intended merely as a shortcut
oh god yes
yes please
how about we just merge the four shuttle types into one theyre all identical anyways failing that ill reply with my standard response to a narrow ui request  yes it should be an option
umm whats wrong with1 set market filter for station2 search by keyword shuttle3 profit i mean purchaseor even1 search by keyword shuttle2 sort columns by jump distance3 purchase

well i tried at least i got a few people who feel the same way as me in the against vote poll threadas to you others i can honestly say that i am happy for you seriouslyyou are obviously pleased by the level of representation you are getting from the csmi on the other hand feel that the csm is completely without purpose at least as long as there are enough reps on it that can tie up the vote and do nothing about hounding the devs on behalf of their constituents with the most important subject to come along since their inceptioni guess the old saying is right if you want something not to get done give it to a committeeto the reps that voted to move forward with this you have my deepest thanks and my pity it will not be a barrel of laughs dealing with the lazy slackers you have on your hands for the rest of your termcheers allme goes back to yelling directly at the devs like i always have
i disagree with the csms position that they were not in a position to work with ccp on this issue or words to that effect the premise that they should wait until the issue hits tq was just laughable at bestthere is a role for the csm here though i do agree that within a few days of the changes hitting sisi was too early and would only lead to knee jerk over reactions and claims of the sky falling ini would move that the role of the csm here is to digest distil and present from the players perspective the balanced views in an intelligent and concise way to ccp 1000s of posts venting bile and whine is not conducive to helping the development process so the csms help is needed to extract the few gems from amongst the drivel  which raises another point about players do they really think theyre going to get their way if they flood the forums with dross thatll turn anyone off reading within a few posts
unfortunately the csm members has largely shown themselves incapable of considering the best interests of the game they as everyone else on these forums generally argue purely from what is best for themselves not what is good for the gameas such the csm has essentially failed completely the csm members do not represent the playerbase no matter how much they claim to but are simply trying to advance their own personal agendas under the guise of representing their voterswhile there may be some players whore capable of providing balanced input for the good of the game theyre not the ones wanting election for the csm nor would they get elected as their points of view would have to include unpopular nerfsimho if ccp wants a capable csm they should just flatout appoint players whove shown themselves to be levelheaded and capable of rising above their own interests and who play the game in different ways the election bs is the surest way of not getting the right people on the csm as has been proven
well ive added the speed nerf issue to the agenda again for the august 17th meeting and urged all the csm delegates to make the effort to get onto sisi for the two intervening weeks so we can hopefully have a more useful discussion at the next meeting fingers crossed we get something more useful from the next onefor the record jade omber zombie ben derider ank voted for a statement on the nano nerf last meeting bane glorious darius johnson inanna and tusko hopkins voted against if you feel that any of the csm delegates who would ordinarily be representing your interests on this issue have made a mistake then id advise you to evemail convo or otherwise engage them in discussion and let them know what you think
well tbh everyone is biased biased people stood for the elections biased people voted for them biased people want biased results the notion of what is good for the game is a bit of a difficult thing to pin down and based entirely on perspective lets face it  the speed nerf is great for some players its superb for gatecampers that want to catch prey easier its great for 00 territorial alliances that want to secure their space easier its excellent for missile boat pilots and pulse apoc aces anyone that got annoyed that people used to be able to disengage from combat will love this patchis terrible for others its a nightmare for small unit roving pvp it sucks for interceptors its rubbish for small ship experts and pretty poor all round for anyone that used to enjoy poking blobs in the eye and living to tell the taleso lets not underestimate the difficulty of defining a good for the game middle ground on this issue not sure anybody is entirely unbiased on the issue really we never did represent the whole player base individual csm represent the parts of the player base that elected them the idea is that the nine voting together then create a rough representation for the whole that is generally never going to please everyone on the current csm using the speed issue as an example youve got some big alliance players some small alliance players some industrialists some roleplayers all representing different interest groups im not convinced there are any actual players that could provide balanced input i think everyone can only provide personal opinions and insight into eve from their own perspective appointed council of special cronies is going down the road that led to the scandals that triggered the initial concept of the csm of course if these guys are nonelected just who chooses them what influence do they and their friends have are they going to fnd out about balancing decisions before other players can they wield power behind the scenes are they going to be corrupt etccsm was an attempt to put player oversight into the democratic arena and what we have at the moment is messy and imperfect and there are some serious problems with the csmccp interactivity and general implementation of the concept sure but tell you what its 1000x better than an unelected clique of special players making decisions in the interests of themselves and their mates without any kind of public accountability or feedback
heres a difficulty many players are able to do the math right away and only need to play on sisi to have their suspicions confirmed ccp however seem to need hardcore evidence and many who play and are not half as technically experienced as they would like to think and a quarter as skilled as they make themselves out to be will thus be rather hesitant to try and speak up for fear that they will need incontestable evidence logs videos or calculations to even be taken seriouslythe forum while supposed to exist for the purpose of sampling the community is most likely to contain more of the less technical people because they are posting here and not in game on the testing servers desperately trying to work out a way to make their ships effective again or trying to find the little cracks and slips in the game design and a forum like this of course also has the disadvantage of being manipulable by people posting with their alts not to mention that it seems that the csm members hardly take all that is being said here seriously because of the overwhelming amount of whinetrollingwhat happened to reasoning reasonable changes taking suggestions skepticism objectivity flexibility and being able to meet halfway and work things outi swear if more people had less masks to hide behind and felt that they could be held accountable for what they said
im agreeing with the op it is pretty disappointing im more disappointed in ccp for these illthought out changes though
i simply disagree ccp choosing a group of players they think would provide valuable input to game balance etc is much more likely to get them some valuable input than the current election egotripthey probably even shouldnt make it public who they are alternately they could hire a couple of people to analyse what is going on in the forum and make recommendations from thatits never a good idea to put inmates in charge of the prison
support votes or not its clear that ccp is going to do something about speed tanks sorry to say you can vote until your fingers bleed 3 votes for all 10 of your carebear accounts and its not going to matter speed will be rebalancedas for the csm it seems they still have their own personal agendas in mind i cant speak for all of them but every person on that panel should be wise enough to say speed is unbalanced
proposal part 1 defender missiles should be removed from the game they dont work additionally using the missile mechanic means each time a defender launches its another object for the game to trackpart 2 a new module called a point defense array is added it is a turret based system but can be used in any highslot it automatically targets incoming missiles and shoots once every 4 seconds it has a 20k optimal and skills will not increase its rate of fire or damage it does not use tracking as current turrets it always hits incoming missiles for the same damage an existing defender missile doeswhy do it having a module autofire at incoming missiles would be a viable counter and could possibly be a useful utility module in some fits speed not using tracking or the existing missile mechanics will reduce the impact on the server it fires missile disappears or takes damage if a torpcitadel this mechanic also allows future expansion into ships that can protect an entire squad from missiles
but it also encourages blobbing since two times more damage fired on you will result in far more than 2 times more damage received imo better change them more into npc defender system just a fixed chance of taking down an incoming missile with a max of one or two defender systems fitted to a ship make it a new module instead of using normal missile launchers
or make the defenders more useful and perhaps also add some other tools as wellid made a suggestion on fi a while back during the rant of the week missiles which amounted towhy would all the other races believe the best way to counter a missile is to throw another missile at itwhen each race has obviously developed their own technology for combat
part 1 i couldnt agree more with but part 2 shoots the whole thing downno skills factored in no ship bonuses this is backwards it would only make engineered noob ships and gangs able to gank battleships and battlecruisers even easier and then youd have to UFFFDber up the missiles againpoint is the ships that can already tank or outrun the missile damage and have plenty of highslots to spare shouldnt get more bonuses theyre strong enough as it is instead make it so that you can fit a scriptmodule to ecms in your loadout to have the ecm work to counter missiles instead of its primary function youll give the ships that are vulnerable against missiles as is  eas some frigatescruisers and recons  a viable alternative to shoot them down and a new fleet role but of course this comes at the cost of disabling them from ewaring specific ships and turning their vulnerability to turrets instead if they choose this option
id say theres a single skill that amounts to what module you can fit and either that same skill or another that amounts to fine tuningthen the defense systems are still automated and you dont have to actually activate them when a missile is fired the modules have a base score for tracking and damage depending on the size meta and tech you could get better performance and perhaps adding the fine tuning would get a little more out of them
i dont understand why we cant have better ratting and mission running out in 00 space specifically the south i dont know how it is in the north but it gets frustrating when i fly through 7  10 systems and run into nothing but frigatecruiser spawns with the occasional rare 500k  800k battleship spawn i understand that 00 should be harsh and i accept that i even see it as a benefit but there should be rewards to the individual player who wants to live out here and make the isk needed to afford the ships needed to live out here you can still make 00 challenging but rewarding and fun the challenge is already there but the rewards and fun are solely missing and lets not even get started on pvp thats for an entirely different topic this is about pve in 00 i dont understand why empire pubbies should be rewarded for playing it safe while 00 players get basically backhanded constantly in the next content patch empire is getting 150 new faction warfare missions and a huge buff to the rewards to level 4 and 5 agent missions any up coming changes to 00 period not that ive seen i dont know if ccp wants players to pve in empire or not if they do its the wrong course to take you cant possible expect everyone to come upto empire to make their isk thats what is going to happen though in the content patch that buffs mission running in empire it is basically going to make it more profitable to run missions there my suggestion is to first buff the rat spawns the majority of spawns i come across should be 1 million isk plus triple spawn battleships atleast plain and simple my biggest challenge within 3 hours of ratting should not be a bs spawn that i can take on as a one month old newbie in a drake the second suggestion is to add more agent missions to player owned space yes you heard right to player owned space there are a lot of ways you can go about doing this and keep it balanced the best solution i can think of is to just add various level 1  5 agents throughout 00 space the trick will be balancing delivery missions what happens when you have to deliver something to a station that is under an alliancecorp control and you cant dock at that station the game shouldnt just say well you are  out of luck mr you could do inspace agents for missions like this i suppose or just make all of the agents give kill missionsseriously ccp throw us a bone here i know you guys have expressed your disappointment in the player population not coming over to 00 in your last report on what the players are doing with their time you guys mentioned only something like 17 of total players live in 00 space and make it their main gameplay choice you know why that is its because it sucks out here buff it up a little and make it more enjoyable stop buffing empire up and making isk easier to make out there you are just going to make the problem of overpopulation worst help spread the population out by giving more incentives to live out here and show players that its worth the risks and throw a bone to the true hardcore players who choose to live out here and wont put up with the pubbie carebear environment that is empire
so you want the economical growthrate to increasei cant support that
a ratter in null can make more than a ratter in empire but cannot come close to a mission runner in empire thats the problem better rats meaning more frequent high quality rats are great for solving thisplayer owned space can have agents make beacon sites with inspace agents that represent the inhabitants of the system and its planets screw courier missions if they cant work but they probably can and dont need to involve stationsi like how in fw you could accept a mission and a complex is spawned right away somewhere in low sec those kind of missions would be great especially l4 and l5s might be interesting if you had to go find the plex  at least you know there is one close by and you can finally make some iskskip to here above is mostly repeated crapif your only concern is overall growth rate following a buff im guess you think its high already but i may be wrong the same effect can be achieved by nerfing empire missions accordingly or increasing some cost somewhere no matter what there is still the problem that its way more difficult to make money out here
i believe 00 income needs to be looked besides owning poses or finding that perfect system
i would disagree on increasing rat bounties more farmers yet missions same as empire rewards but no lp store at player outposts farmers cant touch because they cant dock is very promising
it could easily compensated for by removing lowrisk highincome opportunities from highsec ie the l4 q20 agents which are farmed 237 by dozens of ravens redistribution not inflation id like to see agents available in player owned space not by itself but as one part of a package of changes to the 00 sovereignty system
well i believe i made a topic in the ideas forum some time ago my idea was to introduce missions in 00 like in highsec it does not generate more income but it increase the choices players have on how to make isk i think a nice ammount of highsec people would come to 00 if they would introduce missions in 00 something ccp tries to do hence fw
npc 00 is always more profitable than nonnpc 00 i read on these forums that the more people ratting in a region the worse the rats get which makes sense since you mention you are hitting mostly frigcruiser spawns etc00 ratting is extreamly safe and its almost impossible to kill a cloaking ratter who fits a wcs and knows what he is doingcurrently the problem is 00 ratting is more safer than empire lowsec missions and if anything 00 ratting needs to get more dangerous
more dangerous but more profitable as well imo but i think it would require a serious revamp of a lot of stuff if i had to describe an ideal version of 00 it would contain many more exploration sites of various types and sizes but no asteroid belts where rats spawn wtf are rats doing patrolling asteroid belts why would they bother rats at gates i can understand but at beltsat the same time a complete revamp of the scanning system with much more information available from scanners longer range iff permanently on with signals to indicate new contacts on scanner etc and a removal of local and of course asteroid quality and ratspawns should not be dependent on truesec in such a revamp it makes it too easy to pinpointfarm stuffthen you can tweak exploration sites to be more profitable in terms of bounties etc to make it attractive to run with say 46 man gangs
lies froms someone who gets his revenu from moon minerals and not rats and wants to put other alliances in a disadvantage lol bob never change cheaters
what your mains ceo keeps all moon mins for himself insted of investing it in buiding up a kick ass corp moon minerals is a cheat now
ratting i easily made 3035milhour in the drones region as an example so whats the issuemining in 00 can be extremely profitable with gang bonuses etc its balanced and imo its enough to drag people from empire too 00
some 00 space is better than others but tbh you should be able to make 10 mil an hour in 00 np to do this is a hell of a lot easier than a lvl 4 also add to this the decent money to be found in exploration even by using your on board scanner and im missing the pointi would suggest the best thing to do is to allow player built stations to have agents how this would be implemented i have know idea but i think it would be for the good
dont boost 00 just nerf empire missions
10 mil is more for what a newbie pilot makes i personally can roll in about about 40  50 million isk an hour ratting if the conditions are right and i stumble upon the correct system this happens maybe once a week if even that though it also doesnt help that i dont have a lot of time to play which i cant blame on the game but my weekends are pretty free and thats when eve is the most populated making it even harder to find a good system this whole thing really made me research and look into how rat spawns work and im still confused about a few details here and therethe most important thing out of all of this is to provide more options that make the game more fun lets see a raise of hands from those that find ratting and mining fun i imagine theres not gonna be to many of you especially in the mining category i find ratting to an extent fun but i sure as hell would like something different to do with my time to mix things up a bitthe general opinion is that mining makes players want to shoot themselves in the head even if they do it with a group theres no point in adding something new to the game if it isnt enjoyable look at faction warfare as an example of something ccp clearly did right because a good majority of players doing it actually enjoy it i think the thing is stupid personally but im not gonna argue with the numbers
if you let missions follow the same rules of riskreward and primarily introduce some sort of competition for them you wont need to increase 00 rewards but with the hordes of whining mission runners its unlikely to happen so ill support a increase in low sec and 00 rewards
i personally believe that the danger factor of rats should increase by tenfold for every 1 in security you dropthe highest intensity being 00 requiring 10 battleships and 2 logistics to do
that seems a bit extreme but i would not mind grouped ratting at all thats what i had originally thought 00 would be like when i was just a mindless newbie and didnt know better
you can drastically increase the isk per hour you gain from ratting by simply chaining the spawns1 find a system with the lowest true security rating available to you using the ombey maps the lower it is the better spawns you can reach2 go to a belt2a if only frigate  cruiser trash present destroy the whole spawn2b if only low grade battleships  500k to 1 million bounties  present destroy the whole spawn2c if good battleship rats present  dual 125 million and above  only kill the big ships3 go to step 2you see all spawns go through a cycle from only frigates and cruisers up to triple battleships  were talking triple 3 million isk ones here  if you live in a good deep nullsec region the spawns pass all steps  sometimes skipping a few is usual  and once you destroy the highest step it degrades back to frigates and cruisers restarting the cyclethe whole point behing chaining is keeping the higher steps alive by only killing the battleship rats for isk the whole spawn returns after 10 minutes or so enabling you to farm cash from it until downtime do this in a system with over 10 belts and you can make some pretty mad isk only requiring a bit of time investment at first but paying off within an hourthat said i dont think nullsec needs any buffing some mission agents in player outposts would be schweet  dont do many missions myself but i know a loooot of people would love that feature  but ratting and mining still yields pretty good moneyand yes group mining on a quiet saturday evening after an exhausting week is something out of this world
this is false what type of spawn you get is completely random it does not build up to better spawns killing a spawn just means you have a random chance at getting any spawn from triple bs to frigate and cruiser randomly also there is no such thing as a 3 million isk a pop chainable battleship unless you ment multiple bs which bounties totaled more than 3mil isk for the chain usually a good ratting session will net 20mil from bounties and 15 mil from lootsalvage per hour assuming you dont get interrupted by passing hostiles which happens quite often in good truesec systems
you sure mate i use that tactic when ratting all the time simply destroy the spawns until they become good and then keep it all at that level never had an encounter where i got a battleship rat right after frigate trash we dont get over dual 125 million spawns where i live though that triple 3 million battleship rat stuff  yes 9 millions in one belt  is from my hiking trip to stain empire space  any npc pirate controlled area should classify afaik thats where the big fish live edit oh by the way rats sometimes warp from one belt to another that may give the impression you got a battleship spawn right after a frigate one
ive tested it in systems with 1 belt systems like these have a max of only 1 npc rat group destroying a spawn completely means that a completely random spawn will appear next time in no way related to the previous spawn ive seen a spawn get replaced by a similar spawn or worse spawn from elite cruisercruiser to frigatecruiser destroying the spawns till they become good is completely valid but im saying that they get incremently better part is false also the highest possible chainable bs spawn isnt worth more than 2 mil isk tyrant is worth 185000000 isk which is the highest chainable sansha spawn  you might have gotten a true sansha spawn which is why you have that 9 mil total
naturally none of those will be for the pirate factions no doubt about that in the last 10 hours ratting i have done an average of 60 millionshour faction loot includedmy normal average when not running a ratting spree like this is around 20 millionshour without the faction spawn even the cruiser spawn arent so bad as you will kill them in no time and some other ship would have spawned when you return there
yes no problem there remove all the 4 20 agents from high sec naturally you must find them first as they dont exists
hmm could have sworn spawns build up not that i have tested it to be 100 sure of course just got that general impression from the time i have spent in the belts will have to get back to you with that i also checked the npc database and it appears tyrant is indeed the highest bounty sansha battleship epic failure at my part  most likely i was still too much of a beginner to make a difference between normal and faction spawns back then  i rest my case
you could also try using the compare button located at the bottom of all module info pagesthis will open a window where you can compare different variations of the same module at least
i like the sb animation oh so much no
emptyquotin
turn your effects off there you go issue fixed stop being a  and spamming forums
210 character name makes this too obvious
support
i would support this suggestion but with 1 conditionccp would have to find away of coding modules so that if a pilots not in the ship then they dont change the base stats of a ship i would even support a ham fisted offlining all modules when placed in a carrier if only the restrictions were liftedthat way we could through what ever you want into ship cargo holds but not have the old issue of having 45 expandedrigged haulers in a carrier moving obscene amount of gearfuelresourcesof coarse you would have to provide warnings indicated cargo exceeding limit when you try to move a ship to a carrier maintenace bay
this is the only change youre suggesting the problem is that ccps been pretty lazy about the other half of what you said modules will often offline en masse when a ships placed into an sma mostly on my bloody falcon x  and neither the players skills nor any fitted modules will affect a ships cargo space when in an sma

poasting in a sunday thread even if it monday
the word youre so bothered by is a natural part of human character humans are by nature selfish animals and given a chance to escape consequences they will  murder lie steal cheat and sell their grandmothers and children into slavery theyll do all this for nothing more than a brief moment of happiness for the chance to be the monkey with the jawbone and the puddle of water or for a quick buckof course we have a system designed to superficially overcome our profoundly disgusting and horrid natures its called civilization civilization is a set of arbitrary and unnatural rules that overcome our monkey nature by training in us a sense of the existence of others and the idea that we might become something greater by thinking of others the result is an almost immeasurably small advance in cooperation and unselfish behaviourone of those unnatural rules is that you dont tell other people what they can and cant say unrestricted verbal discourse at all levels is required as it is the replacement for the jawbone threatening jade by asking for her removal is censorship pure and simple it is also worse than pointless the behaviour is natural and removing the word changes nothing about the intrinsic human urge it does however compromise the rules of civil behaviour that might one day control that urgethe fact that you have made frivolous accusations and violated these civilized standards because you couldnt make a sale goes beyond laughable right into absurd and puts you right back in paragraph one
wow just wow from dictionarycom some alternative definitions for using the word raep does not constitute misogyny ever

how dare you spy on me this is an outrage
maybe i was wrong
i confess it was me i who laughed at your joke at the table next to you in that place where you ate some time ago my humble apologies
by the way you really should see a doctor about that
see this this is childish this is why people dont want you in the csm jade not for something simple like the use of that word but because you take childish measures against percieved slights completely out of proportion to what is being discussed and the fact that you dont approach any discussion seriouslya serious answer would have been i was using the term in a lessserious colloquial context whereby i was intimating that they would not have a snowballs chance in hell of succeeding sorry you were offended see easy
whoa there soban slow yer roll youre going to give yourself a coronary
how exactly is calling out a mole with an axe to grind attempting payback in a  poor fashion at that childish
sorry but i preferred to burn the idiot instead ive played eve on hardcore mode for five years not about to start giving alt numpties of the benefit of doubt now
posting in a thread in which the term alt numpties is used
that would have been a stupid answer op got the reply he deserved
you are the first person ive ever seen refer to living in empire as hardcore mode
granted this was my first meeting as an acting alternate but i assure you i have spent plenty of time in 00 throughout the last 4 years and im sure at least some of the others could be considered more than just inexperienced empire dwellers as wellyou might have a case for suggesting that darius is perhaps more qualified on 00 matters than others but hes not the outright only oneben
oh yeah i have no idea who the alternates are just going by the original csm listing and their current involvement in 00 sov warfare none
probably the last too after UFEFF 20080803 173846  ben derindar  nay for this specific proposalwelcome to the 00 powerbloc buddy
thats a sort of fair enough statement sadly the sifting element is overshadowed by snr individual ego and amazing ignorance of existing game mechanics let the designers design if they seek sifted and accurate player feedback the csm in its current form is not the way to do it my alternate suggestion has been posted elsewhere
welp fail i guess you are just as useless as everyone said you would be oh well enjoy your ruined game
ive added the issue to the next agenda for the august 17th meeting and urged the csm delegates to put aside some time to go test the speed patch on sisi and speak to players testing these changes in the interim i consider what was voted against at the august 3rd meeting was my with input from omber specific motion that csm release a collective statement its the csms position that the best answer to the antispeednerf issue at this time is that people feeling strongly against this balancing patch should make time to test it on sisi and form realistic combat situations and provide detailed feedback to ccp developers lets raise the argument from the nerf sucks to this is the impact of these changes and why xyz element needs to be adjusted meanwhile lets ask ccp for a list of of what they are trying to accomplish and whether the changes do that or go overboardthis was refused by the csm 44 vote but it doesnt mean we have ruled out addressing the speed issue or have decided either way on the validitydesirability of changes at this point
oh my god you are so denseso guys what became of that idea for the revolving chairman
lavista darius of course opinion polling only tells you what a given group thinks theres no direct implication that the group is right but knowing what 00 dwellers think is a fairly good antidote to ignorance about 00 affairs and assuming that the poll was actually conducted semiproperly charges of outright ignorance are baseless for that matter assuming that people who experience something directly know it relatively well and that theres no bias in those resulting opinionswhich is true nowhere near as often as id like but work with me here a competent pollster is actually the besteducated person around statistically speaking the smartest guy in the world is dumber than the average of the next 10 who in turn are dumber than the average of the next 100 the bigger the group the smaller the standard deviation of the error this is the reason why democracy works  the average person can be astoundingly ignorant but you stick millions of them in a room and the resulting answer usually isnt too bad it certainly seems to work better than sticking 10 of the best brightest and backstabbiest onto a central committee and hoping for a paradise as long as youre doing it right  safe and cloak before you ask around in local  i imagine that you can ask around without undue risk youll get eaten by the occasional bubble of course but thats what alts that people think are the main are forespecially with a name like ankhesentapemkah who would notice a typo in that name and i didnt say that there wasnt systematic bias either just that it probably wasnt large enough to destroy the merits of the data i hope the 50 interviews were conducted across most of the 00 regions and alliances space because if say the only samples you took were of goons then your data would only reflect the opinion of goons a systematic bias of this sort  like the bias caused by most of the 00 dwellers you know being your goon corpmates  might well introduce a large bias into your data even if your sample size were larger but i should hope someone setting out specifically to run an opinion poll would specifically avoid any obvious sources of bias ankh care to comment on your research methods
welp fail i guess you are just as useless as everyone said you would be oh well enjoy your ruined gameive added the issue to the next agenda for the august 17th meeting and urged the csm delegates to put aside some time to go test the speed patch on sisi and speak to players testing these changes in the interim i consider what was voted against at the august 3rd meeting was my with input from omber specific motion that csm release a collective statement its the csms position that the best answer to the antispeednerf issue at this time is that people feeling strongly against this balancing patch should make time to test it on sisi and form realistic combat situations and provide detailed feedback to ccp developers lets raise the argument from the nerf sucks to this is the impact of these changes and why xyz element needs to be adjusted meanwhile lets ask ccp for a list of of what they are trying to accomplish and whether the changes do that or go overboardthis was refused by the csm 44 vote but it doesnt mean we have ruled out addressing the speed issue or have decided either way on the validitydesirability of changes at this point you can say youre raising the issue until youre blue in the face issues get raised once per session as per agreement youre attempting to waste our time to pander and its not within your purview to do so once again a vote doesnt go your way and you attempt to ignore the system you are with out a doubt one of the sorest losers i have ever come across on the internet thats saying a lot fyiin case you didnt learn from the last few times you dont get to change the rules midstream simply because you dont like the results grow the  upyou know for someone who griped repeatedly about taking these things public ignoring the emails from the rest of the council saying you shouldnt be doing this then posting here is a bit hypocritical id think
here is a linkminmatar combat issuesi have reviewed your blog releases and i concur that you have taken a lot upon yourselves please accept my gratitude for putting yourself in harms way as it were and know that you have my respect for doing soi therefore ask respectfully that each of the csms review the above link it has highlighted several base problems that needs to be addressed with higher end minmatar ships sadly it has grown to 37 pages with no recent developer response and now that there appears to be a speed adjustment change which even as a minmatar pilot myself i agree with i as well as a multitude of minmatar pilots find that this makes it even more critical that the issues listed in the above link be addressedconsidering the depth of the issue and the details several have gone into i also have put up a cliff notes version that gives just basic ideas of what is wrong as well as some thoughts for solutionssummary of minmatar issuesplease many of us and no doubt some of you as well have seen our beloved battleships go from being fearsome beasts to handicapped kittens through the processes of change as well as confusion regarding the concept surrounding our capital shipsthank you again for your time i do appreciate it

titans and cynojammers the combination supports blobbing on unprecedented scale in order to actually take out pos in a cynojammed system with titan support you do not just have to commit suicide battleship fleets but you have to commit absolutely everything in your disposal on the objective the fewer cynojammed systems you attempt at the same time the fewer battleship fleets you have to flush down the toiletpos timing this is why attempting many objectives at once isnt feasible you may reinforce many different objectives but the pos can be timed to come out one at a time so there isnt the option of splitting your force up and attempting different objectives cause the defenders will time them to come out of reinforced after the previous is fully repped to the point where there is only 1 available target at any given timeafter reading all of the specific 00 sov proposals that neglect to identify the cause of the observed problems i think the csm should support 00 sov change through a different meanshalf of you want to propose a specific solution the other half seem content to tell ccp that they are unhappy with current sov mechanicsso why dont you escalate something you can all agree on lag sucks blobbing 1 objective until the servers crash suckslets look at something that ccp doesnt like to focus on system caps they are real not a feature but they exist perhaps if ccp came to terms with the fact that their servers simply cant handle thousands on thousands without ty gameplay they might come to terms with a solutioninstead of having system caps as an embarrassing weakness since its never going to go away use it to an advantage acknowledge that it exists like the rest of us have and design around itwho knows maybe the system owner could reserve half of the bandwidth for whoever they choose and the primary reinforcer can reserve the other half v0v this is a 5min idea so nobody pledge to itsounds like an instance at that point but that is the reality of it anyways you cant pack the entire eve populace into jitaso those are 3 things that i think cause obscene amounts of focused blobbing and terrible server performancetitans  cynojammerspos timingnot recognizing and accepting system caps because its embarrasingim not gonna make any serious suggestions about how to make sov better i think it would be more productive to analyze what causes the bad parts instead of making specific suggestions otherwise the csm will just have more ideas that 12 love and 12 hate if you produce an issue that you all can agree upon then at least you can then create a dialog with ccp about 00 sov
what happend with this it made it into the minutes of the csm then seems to have died any news
the reason it should be like this is beacausethe person that is doing the killing is taking all the risk empire war or whatever hes risking his ship and pod when attacking his wartargets or whatever so why the hell should a 10 day npc corp alt have the right to take the loot with no risk or consequence
here we go
to opnot that i oppose your suggestion but would not your proposed changes just mean that the looters would adapt to work in pairs where the first pilot loots the wreck then jetcans the loot to the second pilot  instant concord protection for second pilot much like ore thiefs operateso that leaves you with the gratification of shooting one looter but it does not save your loot basically youre back to square oneor do i miss something
supporting itits a bloody stupid mechanic the way it is hand holding mission runners and ratters atm make wreck ownership dual at least
at least they can blast some pain into the first guy have him lock as he approches etcmake the sneaky little no risk s work for it
arse   is this profanity filter broken todayedit guess not carry on
qft  make loot in missions belong to the npc faction youre killing rather than the mission runners please
agreedheres how it needs to be fixedpeople not involved with the kill nor a part of the victims corporation should not be able to access the wreck periodthatll solve both lootsalvage thieves and suicide gangs because their scooping ship would have to be part of their corp and as such a target
thank god thats not what the pitboss has asked for because salvage isnt theft get past that and youll do fine in eve
agreestealing is fine but the thief should be flagged to those responsible for the kill
can thieves should be flagged too all for 5 minutes in my opinion he stole stuff in plain view hes a criminal
it is pretty strange this doesnt happen
supported good ideas and commentary some minmatar ships need a slight boost
its worth it to consider how a differentiation of capital missile launchers would change things up a bit if we had capital cruise launchers and capital torp launchers with the same fitting and damage behavior as regular cruise and torp launchers and if caldari get one more launcher highslot could see the following setupspheonixcan fit either four cruise launchers or three torp launchers maybe four if you go crazy on the grid but this loses damage modsnaglfarcan fit either two arty  two cruise or two torp launchers and two autocannonsassume that current citadel torps are in the middle ground as far as damage potential compared to new torps and capital cruise missilesyes short range guns are not valuable when you dont know what range you might end up shooting at but when you do know hotdropping on someone else the naglfar would have the highest short range dps in the game in exchange it still sucks as a sniper can still select damage type to an extent which is nothing to laugh at if youre an eft warrior and know what the enemys setup will probably becpu buff is necessary either way its horrid right now and two capital launcher types wont ease the pain
i stopped paying attention to this thread when some rl stuff came up and bane took it before the csm 3 but knowing ccp the earliest this will be is a month or two if theyve already noticed the terrible design of minmatar capsnidhoggur is a great carrier as long as you never take it into combat as a dread  carrier pilot my carrier only gets on kms when ive assigned fighters from 2m outside a pos im currently training for triage which just makes the nidhoggur that much more awesome 
forgot to support my own topic
yes this is a good idea would be nice to test something before committing a large amout of time to train something you find out you really dont want
dont see any downsides
i am sure i do not need to go into detail here 04 is lowsec make it so there is absolutely no reason why charters standings and anchoring activity should be any different than 03
dont forget you cant get moon poo in a 4i support thisi do remeber someone once telling me that the rp explanation was that 4s were a sort of no mans land between high sec and low sec so all the problems of both and non of the advantages not sure if that was the vision that ccp had but i find 04s differences from a 3 silly

thanks for your efforts jade its appreciated keep on pushing to the other csm members  i think the message given by the vote is pretty clear so i dont understand why you are reluctant on voicing the results of the voxpopuli  invoking the fact that the proposed changes are still subject to change is bst you know as well as i that if we dont act now the nerf is going to happen so get in the frontline and act based on the votesalso unsure what some of your csm members1 that voted against the csm putting something forward are going to test on sisi as they seem to have close to no kb stats  proven combat experience or display any relevant pre nerf pvp experience or does being in csm mean that you are defacto experts on small gang warfare and tactics  if they would have been preoccupied by the upcomming changes they would already have tested is on sisi the day it was released dont you think so

i like the idea in generalnice fiction story btwbut im afraid at the long scale this will only involve more that some part of pilots who curently living in outlaw space will return to more save space and thats probebly the last thing what our developers want to happence in gameatm they are still not managed get to the point where pilots out empire switch to to 00 securety space life and any posseble change what could bring whit in possebility that will result in discrasing population on the long run will be probebly avoidet by ccp in any meansso long ccp will not find out or get any good idea from citizens of eve what can replase local and still not do any impact on population in 00 space they will move that ideas in the corner and wait for better solutionjust my 2centsregard cyb
edited for contenttell you the truth i have never had such a rush in a non combat situation as a small scale roaming engagement with like minded and usualy bigger opponents lag is less and you get to realy fell the fighti usualy come out of those short of breath and swating profusely which is better than the fill my pants feeling i get when someone is trying to kill meof course its just a game and i do get paid to go get shot atif you dont stand behind the troops feel free to stand in front of them
right because graphical artists are going to do a wonderful job fixing lag and optimizing code some people even want it hell it surprised me when i found out you were always stuck in your ship when i first started eveand i would love to have no lag and massive battles but sadly i dont see it happening anytime soon
1 ccp fixes lag so that 400600 players in local can have a fight with 10s module delay everybody says awesome2 players start having 8001000 fights in local new threads like this start players praise the op and obviously blame ccp
didnt read it all but heres my opinionwe want huge fleet fights but not the kind eve offers eves are just lagfests no fun at all
10 second module delay would not be awesome it would be unacceptably slowid think of 23 second module delay as reasonable under extreme circumstances but id understand if others felt that was too much lag
well currently we can get up to 30 minute module lag in large fights so 10 seconds is pretty good in comparison
10 seconds might be better by comparison but that doesnt mean it counts as pretty good
for that youd have black ships unmarked vessels without bounty dropping no loot randomly appearing to hassle people

your posting either take it elsewhere or actually prove what you saying without resorting to vagueries
as a staunch blasterbs pilot  i have to say i fully support sarmauls idea retains the purpose of mwds and at the same time takes some of the edge off the nanoness of select shipsnot that ive ever been pwnd by a nanovaga no not at all im not bitter about it eithergrins seriously though as has been said way easier to implement so come on ccp let it loose on sisi for a few days and get some practical feedback ehavanineobvious alt is obvious
if this goes through you can grab my forum alts bewbies
i just forces every nanoship to fight like the vaga does by pulsing the mwd to do damage for vaga pilots itll be a return to the status quo except maybe they cant surpass 6k ms anymore if ccp tweaks implants and polycarbon rigs but it turns the sacrilege into a slower version of the vaga with less ehp and less dps it removes the ability of the sniperhacs to mwdkite while firing to try and keep their range to avoid incomming tacklers goodbye to interceptor dogfightsthis idea is basically i fly the vaga so make it immune to the nanonerf please and to hell with every other ship
im sorry what is the sacrilege now its not as fast as the vagabond no matter what you do to it so its a slower hac without the tracking or falloff issues turret ships contend with i fail to see why this is a bad thing as they are two different shipsyes it does in this scenario youre relying either on superior piloting skills or better support on your side to keep the enemy support fleet at bay and if the only defense you have against tackle frigates are sniper hacs congratulations you just failed evenow it has been suggested elsewhere that interceptors gain a role bonus that would allow them to use their guns while their mwd is active this bonus could go to the dogfighters aka crow claw sader ranis and while teamwork crow might have been obnoxious thats a very special case that doesnt break the game just the economy no this idea is a compromise between leaving things as they are which obviously isnt an option anymore and making poorly thoughtout and grandiose sweeping changes to almost every aspect of the game while alienating a large part of your player base
yes its true that after this change there will be some things that the vaga does better than the sac notably speed however the sac is still the best tanking hac as well as being workable as a fast attack ship using nanoseach ships should have varied strengths and weaknesses and the fact that after this change not every hac will work equally well as a nanoship isnt much of a criticism
comparing the tranq nanosac to the tranq vaga it goes much slower topping out at less than 6kms has less ehp and has lower peak dps but in exchange for those tradeoffs it has the ability to permamwd while firing missiles the point of the change outlined in the op is to break the sacs ability to perma mwd while firing missiles in addition to breaking the other things that i meantioned for eagles cerbs zealots munnins and all interceptorsthe core of the idea is to try and appease ccpthe masses by breaking every nanohac except the vaga even though the vaga is actually the nanoship that exhibits to the greatest degree the thing that ccp is trying to end  ludicrous speed the vaga will be as effective as ever after this change no one who pilots it will even have to change anything about their fighting methodology but every other hac will lose a considerable amount of combat effectiveness its pretty transparentim all for alternative solutions to the overthetop nanonerf thats on sisi but this isnt the answer1 mwds are used for rapid positioning getting into a fight getting out of a fight or charging down enemies3 abs are used for fightingif you want this to be the case then add in a big multiplier for ship inertia when the mwd is activated to make it impossible to hold orbit otherwise mwds are for all those things and also for speed tanking fighting of course since the idea is really just about preserving the effectiveness of the vaga in the face of this nerf i doubt that will get any consideration
the vaga fights at the edge of web range to do decent dps it has to slow down to do this dpsthe sac can orbit as far out as its warp disruptor allows going full speed spewing missiles that do their damage regardless of trackingyeah its the vaga that needs nerfed
this makes a hell of a lot more sense than what ccp has proposed
interesting i give it 2 thumbs up
supporting this simple and effective idea seeing as the impending changes are ridiculous to say the least
i like this
failure idea just delete the ishtar instead it would be easier or delete the curses drone bayfact is the only things that actually need to be changed are thesemake polycarbs inline with the t2 modules or even down to the same as aux thruster rigslower the cumulative speed boost given by snake implants by a quarter to a thirdlower the speed boost given by overheating mwdsif all that is not enough then look at lowering the boost given by skirmish warfare links slightly
uhm the point is that the ishtar and curse were never designed to zip about at stupid speed dealing full dps
the point is that you get a ging rapier on the field and you shut the hell up
me likes
why even nerf speed in that case if you need to get rapiers on the field all the time anyway theres no needfail itt
minnie recons are how you catch a nanoboat reliably there are tons of other ways to catch them a little less reliably or drive them offi dont really see the 3kms ishtar as a problem tbh not hard to grab
it also breaks the ishtars ability to run full speed while losing none of its dps which honestly is pretty unreasonable heres the issue i think were having  you measure a nanod hacs combat effectiveness in how much dps it can do at speed those of us who support this change measure it in terms of being able to engage and disengage on favourable terms a tactic that nanos are quite good at but that is by no means exclusive to their classyoure right that the vagabond already fights this way were not of the opinion that the vagabond is broken because unlike the majority of carebear mouthbreathers who postsisi are gleefully posting adapt or die lolololz since their ratting raven got ganked in a belt by a nano gang we understand what speed in this game really means however we also feel it is unreasonable to expect to be able to do full damage to a target while you are warping space around your ship to achieve critically high speeds that allow you to avoid the fire of most weapons systemsa speed tanking is not the same as fighting and b you almost had an idea but wrapped it up with an insult so close try again
neither do we but its become apparent that enough people at ccp do see it as a problem that were going to get speed nerfed somehow in the near futureive never seen excessive speed as a problem as ive killed and been killed in a number of these mythically invincible nano ships if i see a 12 kps machariel burn off a gate away from me i give that pilot a fking salute because hes got the balls to put stupid expensive modules on his ship and in his head that he will lose eventually for the sake of raw speed and in a sandbox universe theres no reason people shouldnt have the option to do thatthis change preserves such options while eliminating what makes it actually broken  the ability to do full damage to a single target while your speed makes you nearly invulnerable gang situations are obviously an entirely different affair but again the people gnashing their teeth and calling for nerfs display an obvious lack of experience with nonfail gangs if all youre going to do is object to this ideas necessity then go hit up one of the dozen other nano nerf threads preserve this one for discussing this particular ideas actual merits  demerits please
sounds better to me than what well likely end up withsarmaul 3
supporting this
even with its faults this is 1000 better than what ccp has proposed
i dont like this for two reasons1 mwds are required for battleships to get out of dictor bubbles losing weapon systems while at it would be terrible in laggy conditions2 more importantly it does nothing to address the problem of there being no possibility of catching superfast ships even with dedicated counters such as huginns and muninns and the physics engine in eve not coping with such speeds
will the proposal include a 8 sec mwd reactivation timeif not ships that can use instant damage weapons with rof close the mwd cycle time will have a huge advantagefor example a muninn could cycle its mwd fire a rack of 720 after 10 sec restart mwd and repeatit will lose some dps but hardly no speed use a scripted logitech g15 keyboard for this and the task will be trivial
this is a complete joke  cant find any logical reasondefenitely againts 
in all fairness what battleship class long range weapon can actually track while its moving at 10001400ms
against anyway why exactly
1 if you can activate your mwd you can reactivate your guns after using it tbh2 have you seen how many nano ships die every day there are plenty of counters and if used well they are effective and the whole physics engine cant handle it is a heap of crap people have gotten ships up to 70kms  and nothing broke
i approve and what wierda says lets still keep the mass reduction on afs and webscramturnsmwdoff for giving them roles too
regarding 2 if you mean 7kms by superfast then i agree well see the thing on sisi is that t2vanilla setups are nerfed too much while still not adressing certain problems eg an ishtar can try speedtanking while doing damage missiles hit a lot of ships need speed because they have nothing else range on falcons is even harder to counter because it takes longer to reach them etcppi dont want to invest billions to get an ishtar doing 6k and i dont mind if that vanishes but i dont want to invest billions to get an ishtar which might in the end reach 3k with luck in a straight line and therefore rendering a lot of hacs useless or at least questionable
well ok but i dont really know how you can leave its non necessity out of it ok so the main thing is where does this leave the ishtar and the sacrelidge etc their strength is that they can maybe fit a cap battery and use mwd for a long time while doing damage independent of tracking however they do not go particularly fast they cannot automatically burn out of any danger also s over the vaga that tries to kill a ceptor that is buzzing it and hell even battleships with long range weapons they need to use mwd to get in or out of a position and they cant use their guns at the same time its stupid

this leaves other nano hacs with fewer targets they can engage with impunity sure but if their only strength was the ability to run the mwd and still do full damage then that points to other balance issues that need to be addressedit would indeed mess up a vagabond being tackled by an interceptor which is arguably a direct nerf to the vagas combat ability however the same could be said of any hac and i still maintain that if youre relying on hacs to kill inties then your gang makeup needs to be adjustedlastly since long range guns on battleships are generally the providence of specialized sniper fleets and not closerange small gangs you should be relying more on your covops for warpins than on your mwd for positioning
sarmaul for dev
pulse lasers
supporting this by far one of the best ideas put out with regards to nerfing speed
supporting this 
i still need to think through all the possibilities but asking ccp to consider thisdefinitely its eloquent and simple
much more simple and effective i would love a blue bar on this at least some opinionsmy support
if you nerf snakes and polys almost universally recognized as needing balancing then those superfast ships are brought back in line with normal fast ships which are very catchable and do not break the physics system
shoulda seen that comming technically speaking though pulse shouldnt really be classed as long range weapons i know scorch apocs can be but thats a whole other different issue
against for sure i love the upcoming idea and ive been on the test servers checking it out and i love it even if i loose my crappy nanosac 
this idea has my full support its simpler than the currently proposed changes so will likely have fewer unintended issues emerging it solves the problems that ccp has set out to solve without messing with a lot of things that really are fine right now
what about a ship like the megathron or crusader so with that suggestion a megathron has to wait until mwd cycle is over before it can start shooting what if the other pilot starts to move how does the megathron control range without a mwd or do they have to stop shooting to get back into range
as always supportin sarmaulalso dineek is a hottie
better than the current idea where they simply cant use their mwd at allalso brilliant idea signed
yar far better than ccps mess
maybe increasing some of the lower end systems true sec a bit but tbh i always thought the guys crying about 00 not making enough money were full of shtyes farming lvl 4s will make you more money but it will also make your eyes bleed and your iq to drop sharply for each hour you persist at least 00 has a decent variety of things that all make decent money from plexing to mining to ratting hell if you live near npc 00 you can farm those bastards for missionsi call fowl

no i disagree strongly1 its not realistic that a spaceship doesnt have all other vessels present in the system on its scanner even though not the exact location2 it would totally  up the game as it stands now  the gamesystem is built for local etc  remove local without a different system and you seriously damage the game
no totally against this idea why should you the pirate get any more advantage over the minermissionrunner you work for your targetab
1 onboard scanner try using it once in a while its not realistic that you automatically enter a system knowing exactly who is there without having to put forth some effort to find out2 see 1
repeativly smashing the scanner button is going to make my eyes bleed and my hands get carpel tunnel i would much rather do level 4s with no risk for better rewards thanks ccp for the upcoming suicide ganking nerf sarcasm than rat in 00 without local
ok first lets address 1i could see all ships withing your natural ship scanner range being on scan but system wide cmon how broken is that your telling me that with active scan you can get 20au or so but with a natural passive scanner you should be able to see the entire system and know the pilots affiliation and namefor statement number 2 how is the system built for localto answer this guy we do work and the reward for the amount of work you get for actually trying while roaming is very small even more so when compared to the amount of work rattersminers have to put in for getting their reward you simply watch local warp and cloak or hide at a pos as soon as it adds any new people yea thats balanced and fair we have to scan you out of the belts usually with a directional scanner and warp hoping you were afk or talking or just plain dumb and didnt insta warp as soon as we jumped in system our chance of scoring a kill is about 5 or less where as your chance for avoidance is near 100 as long as your simply sitting at your computeryes something would need to be done to make the scan consant at range with the ability to narrow the scan down like now if you wanted but without the need to ping the system constantly i cant believe active radar would be that hard to come up with for these guys on a minimal lag level however its pretty immersion breaking to always know everything about the first thing that jumps in system with a simple click its also detrimental to small gang warfare and roaming in generaleverybody seems to be on the fair balance trip lately how many of you support the nano nerf and then come in here with the same breath and say that the current intel system is balancedso the miners charge more friggin sweet they finally have a reason to make more than the craptastic minimal amount making mining groups using scouts to cover gates in cov ops ect the result of that would likely be an increase in bs and other t1 ship prices which is also great in my opinion put some loss back into loosing a battleship believe it or not im actually all for you guys making more for what you do
dont remove local only set local on delayed if u talk u show up
i could be fine with some sort of active scanning system but i would still want an increase in rewards mining will probably balance itself out due to the increased risk of mining in 00 is going to bump up the price of high ends till its worthwhile agian however ratting you have a static rewardthe reason for this is if you were ratting in 00 doing it in a group significantly cuts your profits paying someone to watch a gate cuts them even more attackers will always have the advantage if there was no warning of a gate activation unless you had someone actually watching a gate group ratting in certain systems on top of having to split out isk to people to guard you you have a limited number of belts thus a limited number of possible ratters before it becomes way less profitable what i am saying is that in 00 it should be worthwhile to all parties if the ratting rewards were increased not only would that mean it would be worthwhile for ratters to use a scout to help defend themselves it will also mean an increase in the number of ratters in general giving you guys more possible ganks as you go through systems if certain ratters take additional risks to rat without a scout in place i know you speak from the standpoint of a member in pandemic legion and this local change stands to benifit you greatly but i see no reason why you wouldnt want an increase in rewards to go along with the increase in risk otherwise you might find that there is no one to very few people ratting as you go roaming through 00 because were all using our empire alts which would be more profitable

this idea is actually good
actually i sort of do think that i think that ccps sneakiest greiflovingest nanoabusingest carebearrapingest dev should sit down after every proposed set of changes on their internal dev test sever and think what would i do with these new toys how would i use this to win sit and grind out some eft setups of new ships of course this cannot predict everything one dev 50 devs cannot match the ingenuity of 150 000 players however plenty of stuff comes through and i look at the base stats and go woah thats going to be sick or thats going to blow often the stuff that gets exploited is spotted reported and doesnt change hello t2 ammo ccp have listened and do more player testing now but still they should be afraid of how players might exploit stuff thats the whole point i actually think prenerf could be lessened or avoided with more consideration from the players perspectivewell i appreciate you take the time to try and lay some of my concerns to rest but i still feel youve kind of repeated yourself and i still feel that just train for it isnt good enough i think about my small corp which is very small very high sp and has plenty of characters with 34 cruiser vs and even 34 bs vs it would still screw us over if we had to fly one race to compete because we still have some hyperspecialists who focus on one race its not a matter of changing our recruitment policy because were a close network of longtime rl and ingame friends who want to fly together recruiting minmatars or gallentes to replace them is not a valid option ever if it would screw over a small very crosstrained corp like us how badly would it affect a larger younger corp which is surely more the norm
agreed
the detrimental effect to mixed fleets is noteworthy however that doesnt by itself mean that its a terrible idea an emphasis should be put on minor incentive rather than major advantagemake it a small change but at least allow it to exist hell introduce it prenerfed and see how it goes in the beginning seems like its going to work for black ops
how would that work out for bops i must have missed that somewhere
not necessarily work for black ops rather work for the game i was referencing the point that they werent introduced overpowered rather underpowered the same could be done to this if people dont want it to dominate
i see how it would be hard to work out in your case and frankly cant think of anything to propose right nowhowever i do insist that faction fleets sound right and would have some serious advantages for promoting and enhancing gameplay giving a new long term goal about where eve might go from here from my point of view we are done with the ships titans are in and are being flown with impunity outposts have been implemented factional warfare is in sovereignty and lag need and in time will to be ironed out so what now  we cant just hope ambulation will be the new content maybe it sounds conceited that i aspire to give a new vision to eve but hey all it takes is an ideahowever my original intention was to put it up and let people brainstorm about it i have no delusions that my proposed plan would work for everyone and as you demonstrate it would make gameplay very difficult for you and your buddies i wont take the adapt or die approach this is not the army nor can anyone tell someone how to have fun but maybe you could formulate a plan that would include faction fleets and could work even for cases like your companys  i mean maybe changing the game in such a radical way is indeed not feasible but maybe a smaller scale alteration that would add some spice to your run of the mill fleet  fahtims idea about enhancing just racial wings with command ships in a fleet doesnt sound that bad does it 
no actually racial wings dont sound too bad on the other hand this already happens to an extent  you put your armor tankers in one wing your speedy tacklers in another your shields in another and so on its a possibility to take that further to pureracial wings sure that said in principle i am prosandbox player ingenuity and choice which this isnt but thankyou for debating the pros and cons of the idea
this is sandbox and very much so individuals benefit from specialization with a more powerful niche role it makes sense that fleets and corporations get a similar outcomeit is player ingenuity and choice just like one individual has a choice to be great at one ship or decent at all ships and has the option to specialize in a race a group of players should benefit accordingly this proposal creates a mechanic that gives an emergent bonus to groups of similarly specialized pilots it shouldnt force current mixed groups to respecialize however it simply makes sense that somehow a fleet of ships of one race should work well together  slightly better than a fleet of similar ships from multiple races
i also thought of this while working on the crosstraining and small corps argumentsi dont know if it would be feasible to do with the current game code but what if the faction fleet bonus was applied only to t1 ships in the fleet  benefits from this1 you can easily give a roleplaying reason for this ie t2 ships are essentially hacked versions of t1 blueprints so builtin fleet coordination bonus does not work2 t1 ships are easily produced by everyone with very few skills its easy for any corp to acquire bpos of every races t1 ship and built custom fleets to use for fleet ops hurray this way maybe we can actually achieve some level of realism for corp ops instead of bring your own ship to die in for the glory or your corp modules will still be an issue though3 t1 ships are generally weak when compared to t2 counterparts thus making them less exploitable when receiving the faction fleet bonus and in an ideal situation maybe a t1 bonused fleet could be countered by a similar sized t2 mixed fleet4 no need to introduce t3 ships and modules and go through a new hell of whining nerfing and rebalancing thus rendering all current ships obsolete since everyone will want to fly a shiny new t3 ship faction fleet bonus would render t1 ships the new t3 hopefully without them being overpowered5 crosstraining requirements will be reduced to a minimum since you can skill up all ship types of a race up if your corp chooses a different races fleet than your own to iv in what  2 weeks  t2 weapon systems and modules will take more than that true however its just as easy to use t1 named items in most cases6 with playtesting and balancing you could achieve even more freedom and sandbox mode gameplay giving players the chance to go in their t1 boosted fleets against t2 mixed fleets one could actually argue that it would only add to gameplay and not take anything from it just more choices7 t1 ships might become more of just a stepping stone before you get into their t2 counterparts a lot of work has gone apparently in creating those ships its a pity for them to be just noobships and poor mans choice battleships of course a totally different class but hey i am pretty sure a solution can be found about them8 i cant wait to actually fly a bellicose again  yes i was silly enough to purchase one when i was grinding lvl2 missions
updated based on recommendations
what u should do is diminish damage of ddd if u want them not to wipe entire blobs it will be much much easieron the other hand neutralizer effect is currently a bomb effect i dont think titans need such a extra addon warp calibration stuff can easily be exploited by more than 1 titan gangs you cant even run from them anymore 4 titan for a guaranteed kill with even 50 less damage dddsheat damage is too much calculation for too little return rp wise good but why should we have such a weapon that creates a huge lagmy sucky idea  a beam that kills with single shot 1 single target with a great tracking and say 250km range on titans with 200kmaybe more for a guaranteed kill racial damage p that can attack every other 10sec a titan against a fleet yaarrr and actually it will make pointing a titan much much harder actually make it somewhat ew invul once againthink titans as deathstars with beam weapons crushing 1 target at a time btw i never fly a titan 
4 titans is 4x the risk for the same damage its also 4 titans that are scrambled on grid for 20 seconds minmum assuming they dd at the same time thats more time for heavy dictors to get on them for points more time for hostile caps to get onto grid and fry them
i actually like this a lot still very very effective and also doesnt wipe out a fleetmaybe have it blow all bubbles disable all modules for 20 seconds neutralize all capacitor jam everyone for 20 seconds and also all enginescancel all modules effects except siege modei like it any change to the ddd is a good change
i was under the impression originally that isk farming was a macrominer problem but now i see that these greedy bastards manage to parasitize the game throughout everyone suffers except the sleaze bags doing the damage as some have noted it is not an easy problem to manage but some things can be done ccp should deal with offenders in any link of the chain swiftly and without second chances one thing that may make isk farming a little more difficult is simply to take away the wardec protection that membership in npc corps provides it would adversely effect some innocent players but not to an egregious degree i think to deny techii ships and equipment to npc corp members thus flushing many macroers into more vulnerable positions additionally i should hope that ccp and our reps see the danger to eve these defilers present the more they succeed the more of them we can expect to see polluting the game and the more eves economy will degrade i encourage relentless and aggressive search and destroy efforts by ccp these are merely suggestions not demands and a statement of my staunch support for crackdowns against these parasites
yes i support the extra fitting idea this will give mining barges a small boost pirates might not like it but why should a solo miner be such an easy targetab
oh i think its fits perfect into the give mining profession some attention located here
maybe im missing something here because its early in the morning but to get into a hulk you need mining barge 5 and thats a 20 day skill from iv to v with 4 to the needed learning and advance learning skills and 3 implants what i find odd is that you need only mining barge iv to get the exhumer training skill but you cant actually fly any of the exhumer ships until you get mining barge v along with the other required skills
this is what the retargeting delay on cloaks is for of course that method would be hilarious with a sinand since im training up sin skills now i almost want it to be implemented just for that but i have no objection to a black ops getting the drop on somebody when its lying in wait to do exactly that
i support this
except the whole complaint against cloaks needed balanced is due to the fact that a ship just rendered visible can still use drones or aoe immediately
yeah except that theyd have to aggress you before the drones would do anything if you cant get a lock and once a drones active it cant be scooped assuming theyre just looking for a cheap steal and not a fight theyll just run when they decloak you hence its mostly limited to black ops given that bombers dont have drone bays and given the nature of the bos the sin is the only one id want to try it with
you can use that excact same line of reasoning as support for giving fw its own forumhow the hell are new players gonna find anything about fw atm no bridging thereand a new player reading the first few posts in caod is sure to not return there for quite some time no bridging there eitheretcso agreed  a fw forum is needed to bring fw to the massesgets my thumbs up
this is pretty simple change everyone in highsec space should be unattackable by default unless they intentionally flag themselves for pvp basically attempting to activate weapons or hostile modules against someone in highsec who is not flagged for pvp should result in an im sorry i cant do that dave message being printed on the screen and the weapon or module should refuse to activate to flag or unflag for pvp you simply rightclick on your ship display and check or uncheck an highsec pvp enabled option pkers who flag themselves for pvp can show up in the overview with a flashing blue background  that way they can find one another to fighthighsec also needs a dueling mode so that you can fight your friends without flagging for general pvp this would work by rightclicking on your opponent in the overview and click a duel option your opponent does the same for you and the duel starts five seconds later the duel ends whenever either combatant leaves the grid where the duel was started or when either combatant takes structure damage of course since this is just a duel the worst damage that either ships can take will still leave it with one point of structure repairs to recover from damage received in duels should be free because theyre just for funas for war decs they still apply like normal in lowsec but in highsec you should only be able to attack war targets if theyre flagged for pvp concord is getting more strict in highsecurity space all the way around since that nasty business in yulaii think that these changes will fit in very well with the theme of ccps most recent changes
no
just for clarification wasnt this idea already raised by a member of the csm
mans just sayin that ccp should cut out all this middle ground crap and do what it is theyre obviously heading towardsthey can even call it the trammel expansion so everyone will know where they stand
i agree completely if theres one thing everyone knows its that empire space is for consensual pvp only all this nasty business with empire wardecs and suicide ganking is simply ruining this game after all if this game isnt about macromining safely in highsec whats it about
possibly great minds think alike
this is not wow i know thats a very standard comeback but in this case the references are so damn plain to see that its appropriate
as an american i think that ccp should allow concord to do its job and stop appeasing the terrorists youre either with us or against us and hate freedom
definately my playstyle is as valid as any griefers actually my playstyle is more valid because i have ethics and morals killing other players should be a capital offence that should apply to 00 and low sec too if you kill anyone in 00 whenever you come near a low sec gate you get executed and your character biomassed if you kill anyone in low sec whenever you come near a high sec gate the same thing happensthat would make the game more balanced when it comes to people who simply dont want to pvp
see my sig
i see what you did there
ha ha a parody thread how droll
highsec pvp should be optin only  nohighsec is not 100 riskfree and ccp never intended it to be nor should it be plenty of other games that offer that kind of mechanics hint hintits safer but definatly not safe nor should it bealso give us dueling mode  sure why not dont really care either way  but cant see what it would hurt
not yet
why in the world would any one split there forces it makes no sense the way covops and intel works now avoiding a gang is pretty tough if they are hunting you and if you take time to sit at a gate to capture it you are asking for a beating especially if they are currently hunting youlook man i have seen first hand certain dead alliances doing the cta spilt forces thing and they get boned every time when you call in for fire on a target you do not call in just enough to get the job done you call in enough to obliterate
in some cases it would make sense to do it  it just depends on how far apart youre going to split them like how many jumps away if the travel time between groups is longer than the time it takes to capture a gate or one group can stall the blob sufficiently to let the other one accomplish its goals then it makes a lot of senseyeah in a single system that takes 20 second to cross with your blob theres no advantage to splitting up  but if you have groups operating all across a constellation or region hitting gates where the enemy forces are not and evading or skirmishing with them when the blob shows up that can work it just depends on how the system is designedmy point is that there is a distinct potential for great use of tactics given the right mechanics and that much of the current conventional wisdom doesnt have to apply to a proposal like this though many people just assume that it does
kelsini will give you credit for the work you put into your proposal i do recognize the fact you did work this out the best you could the presentation left too many angles for objection keep your readers  audience focused on a few points and each point should be understood with in the first two or three sentencesthis will give the opportunity for others to expand off the bullet points by putting out too many working parts someone somewhere will attack it and not vote for it or completely misunderstand what you are driving at which a lot of players will look at it and think that this will be as complicated as what is written you gave the option for others to expand but there was so many things to look at it you saw frustration you might not be able to put all three layers on at once it might be too much you might have to install one layer at a time and then only add the next layer once you see the first one working
thats very good advice i appreciate that i think youre right and the big picture was obscured by some of the little bits also i appreciate the critiques it helps pinpoint what is the core of the idea and what can be tossed for clarity these sorts of things do need to hit the right balance between detail and big picture
farrqua is right ofc but there is a fundamental problem with the direction of the op as well as many problems in the detail this proposal reduces the focus on internet spaceship pew pew and instead presents logistical micromanagement as an alternative battlefieldlogistics isnt that much fun  and there is already too much of it involved in holding 00
i may have missed the meeting where ccp asked for a way for small gangs to impact sov i understood the context i just find the idea stupid and thought the proposal was bad part of the challenge of conquering space is putting together the forces to do it if you lack the capability to acheive step one why should you be able to scratch a dent in sovreign space you are not entitled by virtue of the subscription fee to success in conquerable space all you are entitled to is the opportunity and a semi level playing field to compete with the rest of the subscribersi also agree with the other poster and have said so repeatedly both in csm meetings and in iceland in a lot of cases your opportunities for small gang warfare with an impact are there you simply arent doing it
if the servers could handle all the people brought to a fight then what you are saying makes would be ok but if 50 people come to fight 150 at a tower nobody is going to deny that when lag hits every single time without fail the side with the moar pilots avaible will win because they will have a higher number playing and not desynched the primary reason sov should be looked at is because you have to shoot for long periods of time large numbers of pilots  lag and sitting around or being desynched and lagged out is no fun in the end this is a game and if the core mechanic only suites the masochistic thats not really a game then is it small gangs should have as much viability to affect game politics as large gangs balancing the desires of mega alliances while providing interesting content to smaller alliances is no different than any other aspect of the game just cause you can befriend 10000 people doesnt make your subscription any moar important or game play experience any moar specialthe other side is that just because a lot of people can get togther doesnt give them the right any more than the small
the ccpcsm minutes 00 sovereignty issues
fyi youll have one hell of a time trying to convince a goon of the correctness of that last partas for what youre trying to say at first i think that can just be called off as plain wrong if what youre talking about is game politics on a large scale small scale yes maybe we want the smaller corporations to be able to perhaps chip away at some larger entity with planning and cleverness and opportunity and you should implement mechanics that allow even small companies to claim ground if theyve got the balls and the strength to do itbut this does not change the fact that most people dont and that in the face of the monsteralliances most everyone will back out at even a hint of retaliation perhaps most of all because its so damn easy in the game to find out just who did what and where and when and where to find themchanging the last part of the equation that the alliances might have a harder time to track and punish certain offenders if they are smart enough will probably be a more realistic turn yet still nothing should really take away the power of a big alliance presuming that they can coordinate and organize well enoughanyway to me this mostly just points out that you need to think past politics mostly and introduce some new sort of tactics or entity small hardcore gangs and strike forces that operate independently and without attackable points or assets to lose being paid off by mothercontractor corporations and thats quite achievable with the current game mechanicsif theres anything that might upset skirmishing warfare as its seen in eve its the ability to restrict the access to space via lockable gates that have to be hacked or circumvented and i think that this is an idea that should be clarified and brought attention to
yes actually it does and it always will there will never be a mechanic that can change that truth you may not like it i may not like it but bigger will always be better and there is no way to change that and still present anything remotely resembling a sandbox
i didnt write the notes this is actually in some ways contrary to what was actually said
well the discrepancy between the published minutes and your memory aside this was the context of the proposal clearly outlined at the start
quite true but shouldnt it depend on the situation sometimes a level of autonomy and selfcontrol and most of all of inconspicuousness and the lack of having to worry about retaliation is greatly favorable to a massive front and assets that are easy to strike atthe two reasons this is not the case in eve is because 1 you really need a dread or two if you want to incur some palpable losses and 2 because its damn easy finding out who executed a certain attack and tracking them down both reasons arent really in line with real life
funny that sounds almost exactly like what i was saying wrt to carriers
a goon in the csm this is why the ccp will never take this council seriouslyif you want ccp to truely listen to the csm then goonswarm needs to be removed from itif they say they exist to destroy the game and that in order to win eve is to get players to quit the game what makes you think anything that comes from them is in your best interest
wow could you link me that ive always wanted to see where we announced that this is our official position on eveor even more simply eve can be won
just ask your queen bee
there is even more than one goon in csm
credibility lost until you link your claim
topics like this one shows that goonswarm member shouldnt be a csm delegate
1 nothing strange about it it should be obvious i crafted those two sentences for just that effect and to make a point2 you still have not made a reply no more than you did in the thread you linked post 126 of this thread you claim i dont have enough experience or skill to figure it out you claim to have that experience and skill you claim to be in possession of proof to your claims i claim no such proof exists when asked to provide that proof you dont even offer a reason for not doing so3 conclusion there is no proof of your claims otherwise youd post the proof if for no other reason than to discredit me this means your your credibility just went down in a big flushing sound and all youve been doing is blowing smoke out your keester seems like a pretty straightforward conclusionwindjammerps when you swim in shark infested waters you should take care not to cut yourself with your own knife
i apologize for attempting to hijack this thread but i would like to talk about carriers and how to properly give them a more defined rolenot to say limited i have no problem if theyre effective id like them not to be the cornerstone of a fleet to accomplish this there are a few things that need to be fixed1 make the singleshiptype rr circle harder to do without making sacrifices repper modules can take up more slots make a reason to go into triage without instantly entering the dread arena of conflict without offering any useful repair2 more types of fighters with different accuracies instead of the omnifighter we have now one with bs tier gunnery one with cruiser tier this will force carriers to choose where on the food chain they will feed and to have a more focused fitting3 drone control units get less cpu requirement and more are required to maximize selfdrone deployment capability4 give carriers more tools for shepherding a group of ships who are carrying fighters placing them more squarely in the role of a massive fleetsupport ship that vastly increases the capabilities of the ship its supportingspecific changes vastly decrease the stats of rrs increase their cycle speed and make them dish out smaller faster repairs give triage a huge bonus to repair speed and amount but with the ability to move on grid inability to repair other carriers in triage two types of fighters with the same bandwidth requirements allow carriers to assign fighters while in triage make drone control units have more effect while in triage and increase the bonuses to rrsin a utopia of feature requests id ask for instead of smaller reppers a module that raises the resists of targeted friendly subcap ships when in triage just like poss use stront to make themselves invulnerable carrier stront is lathered onto the targeted ships and absorbs much of the energy of attacksutopian goala carrier triages while flying around as the overlord of a group of bss giving them huge damage buffs via fighters and huge logistics support the carrier adds about 2k dps via deployed fighters and can repair an additional massive amount of dps carriers cant act to full effect as solo ships compared to what they can add to groups of battleships and cruisers
exactly nobody should listen to either of us until were willing to prove ourselves im glad you agree that youre just as full of  as i am
is it even on the agenda
why a new forum to give you someplace to spam in apparently
it has become obvious that ccp is in the process of taking this game in a whole new direction changes to nanos and suicide ganking might have been called for to some extent but the way ccp has gone about it is completely contrary to everything they have stated in the past it is almost as if all the old devs have moved over to something else and a totally new crew has taken over a crew with an intent to make the game more main stream this worries me i play this game because it is a niche game because it is a sandbox and because it is a pvp game is ccp now working on removing that niche it certainly seems that way i dont request any changes in the game here i would simply like ccp to state their future aspirations with the game i dont wanna hear details about fluff like ambulation and other crap but what the vision is for the game is is to remain a pvp game is it going main stream what will ccp do to increase pvp will anything be done to reduce blobbing will anything be done to boost piracy i just want answers so that i can decide wether or not to invest more of my time in a game i used to love
i agree to me it seems like ccp is intentionally trying to spoil this game
would like to hear something about the direction this game is going so i can decide if its worth my time its sad when the last mmorpg that tried to be different caves in
ill cancel when we get 40 man raids with purple loot but until then i too would like some sort of state of the union to the player base with ccps vision for the future of eve and where they want to truly take the game over the next 1 to 2 years as it is right now ccp is very vague and unclear in what they are trying to accomplish we can tell they have something in mind but we dont know exactly what it is they are trying to do and what they might do in the future im concerned about how far ccp is going to go with all of these carebear buffs
theyd skirt around the question if asked anyway but its worth a try
right now im just incredibly disappointed by ccp as these changes are the complete opposite of what i have heard of ccps vision for eve and that vision was why eve is the only mmorpg that i play
yea they said they wanted to reduce blobbing  nano nerf is the opposite of this and they actually said they didnt want to make empire completely safe and again they are going in the wrong direction
i think the significant number of posts concerning factional warfare gives a good insight into the dirrection they want to take the game and its pretty similiar to what they have always saidthey want null sec to be the pvp endgame and have people shooting each other in the face things that increase combat or encourage people into lownull sec are a general goalyes they are looking into the nano and wardec systems but they are looking into them with the in theory at least goal of increasing fighting the perceived problem with both of these aspects is they encourage not combati do not see that much of a change in what they have been saying i think they have been somewhat floored by discovering that half their player base never leaves hisec though so perhaps they are trying to get their barings there
read the latest dev blog then respond again thanks in advancehere it is
csm anyone
wow while it may make the criminal justice system more realistic it is interesting what effect this will have im not sure if im really worried about it though except that this does give afk and macro miners more protection there really should be a taskforce for that as well
the irony here is that was posted by a dev with the name fear
making part of me cling to the thought that it might all be just an evil prank that would be the eve devs we used to know
but they are doing the complete opposite with recent proposed changes
i guess what it boils down to is how many people play the game for the sandbox and how many play the game in spite of iti think nekopyat hit the nail on the head by saying that ccp have been floored by how many of the player base are high sec huggers
the problem isnt the penalties imposed for killing people in hisec space outside of a concord sanctioned war but rather that people can totally avoid warsi dont care if joe schmoe the solo carebear wants to live in an npc corp and carebear his heart out and i dont really have any desire to see him blown to bits for lulzunfortunately npc corps are abused by players and organisation who want to protect what should be legitimately targetable parts of their gameplay which ultimate upsets the balance of pvp especially when it comes to logistics resupply and money earningnpc corps need to be revised in some wayi am all for npc corp protection and even bonuses but not immunitykeep starter npc corps as they are but create new npc corps which provide an advantage to joining them inline with the rp backstory and let those corps and factions provide npc help to their members  but allow them to be wardecd at a high costif players in npc corps lived in a little solo bubble with no possible interaction with other players then i could care less if they were totally immune from any form of attack  but they dont live in a bubble even if they think they do and that needs to be taken in to consideration when making any changes to rules of engagement
loving the changes all of them guys with good standings barely getting a slap on the wrist for wasting a fraghag in low sec shouldve been in since 03 what took you so long ccpabout the npc corporations they should be linked to fw and the militas there tasked with their protection opening them up as targets for the other militias
thats kinda the reason behind this thread if they want to cater to the carebears thats fine but then i hope ccp stops lying to my face and tells me their plans have changed so i can stop wasting my time on something i wont like
quiteplease take your gloating or whining to other threads this is a request for clarification from ccp
not supported
so you dont want a clarification from ccp boy youre smrt
pretty much
i think its just a rebalance look at eve its far too lopsided too many muppets doing the same thing over and over and over and over times change eve needs a change they are stirring the pot and letting things resettle into a new environment we all adapted before dont feel like you cant adapt againit doesnt worry me at all they are doing some housecleaning too many cockroaches have accumulated time to use the bug bombs
then why are they only exterminating the roaches in the kitchen while throwing crumbs to the roaches in the bathroomim good at this analology thing aint i
because they are tossing out new interesting crumbs in new interesting areas to try and entice new interesting experiences
id like to know toobut i aint spending rl cash or isk on a sub thats gonna be wasted waiting to find out
but still catering to only one particular kind of cockroach analogieswhat ccp is doing is catering only to one play style while pvp gets nerf after nerf particular nonconsentual pvp of which piracy is a part high sec becomes increasingly safer i want a clarification from ccp if their intention is to continue this trend if it is i will have to reevaluate my decision to renew my subscribtion because i dont want to play that game
clarification on what i read all of the dev blogs every articleinterview with ccp i can find watch all of the fanfest videos and read every last word in every issue of eon its all there for the smart person to figure out you just have to pay attention
agreed its ccps game and they can take it in whatever direction they want i would just like a clear statement of that direction
because if they are going to cave in to whiney carebears like you i want them to tell me to my face its such a complete aboutface that im having trouble believing itother than that you are an alt who does not support a request from another person for ccp to clarify their stance on certain things that makes you pretty stupid its amazing how 99 of the proponents of this last nerf are alts makes you wonder
you know if hisec is supposed to be the nursery grounds where players can learn the interface and practice pvp in safety ok fine thats fine its not what id prefer but it would at least be some kind of coherent architecture but in that case hisec should have much lower possible rewards than losec00it makes no sense for the safest space to be be the most profitable
edit duplicatewhy dont ccp fix their forums rather than mess with the game
yeah never mind all the inference interpretation and exegesis what about a clear unambiguous statement that we can refer to when making plans or giving advice or deciding whether we want to stay if you know of one such please link to it in this thread instead of making condescending but contentfree remarks
first you know nothing of my play style to call me a carebear though i could really care less what you think and secondoh the irony me whining pot calling the kettle black herealso this isnt an alti dont have an alt
none of that is required for you to make your decision its simple if you enjoy playing eve then stay if you dont then leave its very simple and requires no outside input
i support this thread it is somewhat similar to mine below
then gtfo of this thread kthxplz
yes thanks for that advice captain obvious its the future direction of this game im asking about
yes  i too would like to know what direction eve will be taking if it is becoming a carebear game like wow i wont nescesarilly quit but i might just make a change of career maybe into l4 missions so i can farm billions of isk a week then once i have enough i can use it to buy a few mining characters  have them farming isk for gtcs in perfect safety while i go around suiciding miners with faction fitted ships
all the changes reported lately are crap
the only nerfs i see are rebalances to loopholes and exploits that have been abused and overused for too long someone mentioned having npc corps redone to be war deccable i find that probably opening up the bottle to way more abuse than good it would only lead to people wanting to move their goods to resort to npc corp hopping and maybe even creating alt after alt so what if people are safe i could care less they are still never 100 safe unless they sit in a station all dayheres an idea if you want to implement npc corp war decs then perhaps those deccing the war would also have to deal with npc ships not to mention losing docking privileges at their stations
fine ill happily take on the perkone ships i see
i agree with this completely and while i think that its a bit extreme to say that pvp is being nerfed wellanyway people who want to  with others will always come up with new and curious solutions like smartbombing ravensgeddons new approaches to pvp that do not involve just nanoing
i dont think the game is going in a new direction at all i think its just being fleshed out a bit more gaps filled in bridges builtone of eves biggest problems is its very steep learning curve factional warfare and the upcoming security changes and nanonerf all make it easier for beginning and intermediate players to learn to play better in relative but not complete safety and with a little more structure which they need the huge 00 sandbox which is what makes eve unique is still the endgameno its not perfect and more tweaks are surely on the way 00 should be more desirable for example as has been suggested many times lets not get our panties in a twist though
but the increasing safety of hisec is not being matched with decreased rewards if hisec is supposed to be eve with training wheels on then it shouldnt have 20 l4 agents tbh hisec should top out with 0q l3 agents  and i say this as someone who runs missions in hisecwhat we have is a situation where players can accumulate vast sums in near absolute safety i speak from personal knowledge because ive done it leave an alliance spend a couple of weeks l4 missioning while seeking for a new corp make enough isk to buy and fit a dread and enough lp for a spare cnr  just in caseseriously i have a spare faction battleship gained just from the lp i made while spending a few days working up the isk to pvp for a month or two with essentially zero risk and zero competition the biggest playercaused problem is that ammo is kind expensive but not quite expensive enough to go 5 jumps to buy it at regional averagei would be interested to hear your case that the above is balanced or good for the gamemarket trading is a little different  mess up and you can lose your isk i have no issues with that
the only issue i see if ccp enforcing teamworkwait arent we playing a massive multi player role playing game
lol wait a second you are talking about faction war right its already there special npc corps player not protected in empire space special story line and rewards hmm that sounds awfully familiar
low sec is very unsafe it is impossible to enter low sec system in a battleship it is impossible to undock a battleshippvp players pirates rip off carebears who actually create the wealth if there are no carebears there will be no such thing as profit from pvppvp is about destruction of assets carebarism is about creation of assets pvp is not fun when you have no means to support it
eve is not as black and white as you think it is there are some of us who will gladly fill the production void left by carebears if you chose not to produce there are 00 producers in every alliance making a profit with space around them that has no consequences to blowing someone else up
i would like to see the local to go away local currently is too much of an easy tell its stupid op you say you are a real bad ass and most pirates like your self which by your own definition are the true decent criminals who are these exactly i am sorry but i dont know how many times i jumped into a system and every target to be had scurries like roaches when you flip on the light the only ones clinging to the local are the ones that have supposedly lost the use of bacon type programs and depend on it for intel to save there own ass now with respect to continually hitting the scan button i agree it sucks but maybe we can give more tools to the pilot to try to pinpoint targets
i wish local would disappear and my ship would tell me when a ship got within 2 au of meexampleme humsme whistles computer danger will robinson dangerme o shipirate warps ini make an attempt to warp out
sensors scanners whatevernone of them really matter when it comes to a chat roomand until ccp actually comes right out and says local is the ingame manifestation of your hailing frequencies and chatting is truly shiptoship communication then it doesnt matterpeople are exploiting local plain and simple they are looking to see what familiar faces are in the system and then hunting down the faces that arent familiarand the simplest solution is make local a recent speakers channel instead then the only faces that will even show up are the ones that spoke in the last few minutes which spies shouldnt be too chattyas for finding people nearby everyone still has an onboard scanner right what with a range and direction selection
we need local otherwise we would hardly get any fights
what about get rid of local in lowsec makes piewats happy while boost pve in low keep it in 00 as an intelligence tool and get things like corpalliance tickers in there for even faster scoutingor everyone who is in a fleet is shown everyone whos not in a fleet is hidden by default
behind this one hundred and twenty percent
that sounds nice and all but whos dollar is being donated to charity
well i guess that depends on if one believes isk are indeed a form of virtual asset in the sense that they have actual value outside of eve if you do think they meet that criteria then it is the people whom donate isks dollar and ccp is acting as an exchange or go between to convert isk to usd or some other form of cash but if you dont then it is ccps dollar that is getting donatedwhole thing realistically is a bit of a grey area as even though ccp does have it that the trading of isk for real world cash is against the eula and that by several legal mechanics they do own all isk anyhow but the fact that a black market exist for cash to isk exchanging also establishes that there is a real world value for it as people are willing to trade some form of currency for them at an established rate also the exchanging of utc bought with cash for isk also establishes a real world value by proxy of the relation of utc price to isk trade
yay now the make a wish foundation can give out free titans 2 issues1 a cap on how much dont want ccp going bankrupt2 must be legitimate fund ccpyour beer fund are not legitimate
basically the isk fund players donate to could be used to purchas gtcs and youd just need ccps blessing to resell those gtcs through the eve store or something for cashitd be great publicity for ccp to do this too
isk goes to ccp charity account charity account goes on forums buys gtcs with isk ccp charity account does not activate gtcs but instead donates their cash equivalent to charity isk moves from donors to gtc sellers money moves from gtc sellers to charity its a bit complex but all wellordered
so basically the result is ccp gives  to charity edit the idea is that youre giving isk which belong to ccp not you to ccp to give up  which also belong to ccp away to a charityi wonder if you considered the practicality factor my bet is that someone at ccp is having a chuckle but ive been wrong before
yes if you say isk have no real world cash value then it is that cut and dryhowever even though the eula does state that it is illegal to trade isk for real currency even ccp have to admit that a isk in sense of a market where there is demand that will pay with cash that isk do have some though extremely low real world value as does any popular mmos in game currency resources and itemsvirtual assets is a very immature field of economics with a lot of complexities to still be exactly looked at so it will no doubt take a little figuring out to establish just what sort of value a contribution of isk actually does have and how stable it really isas for your point of ccp owning all isk well as an example the united states federal reserve a quasi private and public institution owns all the us currency printed through the us treasury system yet the united states government makes its citizens pay it in usd for taxes etc etc at a simple look it would basically be saying that the united states prints money for citizens to earn so that it may partially collect it at a later date but it is not nearly that simple which would arguably also be the case here which is why id think it be great for the csm to suggest it to ccp so it could be examined further
been trying to get my head around thissequence of events would beplayer a buys a gtc from ccpplayer a puts it on the market for however many iskplayers bz donate enough isk to an in game rep of the charity in questionccp pays player a the isk asked forccp does not activate the card but renders it not activateable so player a cannot re sellccp donates someall of the cash they gathered from the original sale of the card to player a to the charity involvedwinnerslosersplayer a is ahead  he has successfully converted his rl dollars into isk which was the whole point of it as far as he is concernedplayers bz are ahead as they have a warm fuzzy feelingccp are ahead as they have received positive pr and removed a gtc from circulation without having to support the bandwidth etc required in gameccp are ahead as they now have a tax writeoff assuming laws in iceland regarding corporate charitable donations are similar to elsewhereccp are down because aside from the nominal saving of not needing to provide bandwidth and other support for the gtc user and also the amount of possible tax offsetting from the charitable donation they have not made a profit on the card but theyve not made a loss eitheri can see this working provided that ccp buys the gtc from a player who has already bought one with rl cash  that way they are not just removing the monies from their bottom line which they would be under a simpler model of the above process removing player a from the equationdisclaimer im blonde the above may be complete hogwash 
no that is pretty much as i saw it to but i also wouldnt be surprised if someone hascould think of a better solution
it is an interesting concept but several things need to be adressed1 why doesnt ccp make isk a real money economy game such as entropia if any mmo besides entropia has the economy to do it eve does of course they would need to review the entire way their economy is setup to do so because there will always have to be more losers then winners in terms of holding large quantities of isk or could just have something like every 1 billion  10 usd so even say ebank were to liquidate the entire stock would only get 10000 ish usd assuming they have 1 trillion isk at the time2 barring a rmt economy perhaps you should consider something along the lines of players donating gtcs instead of isk this will make things much smoother since a player can buy a gtc from another player who bought it with cash and then say have an option on your account page to donate gtc to charity 3 unequal donations if we assume that a direct gtc donation vs an isk donation is desirable then the gtcs usd worth at purchase should not be donated instead a portion should be donated such as what youll see on tv where x amount of every dollar is donated this means that ccp isnt cutting a grey on donated gtcs but instead donating say 50 of the usd value to charity
no the result is isk buyers are giving their  to charity instead of it going to paying another players subscription fees other than admin fees it doesnt cost ccp a penny
i would actually mine at times just to do this
nothing bad about thisccp show us how big your heart is
im speeking about discussion what goin on forums for the very tolong time removing local chatgive playres one week of experiance without local chat  to all of them who for and aganst iti beleave it will be not much hard work to implement just some simple changes to make it posseble1make pilots only visible in local once they speek2 incrase ship scaners to maximum range of systems3 automated warning alert once one of the vessels get in radius of 5au from your vessel without giving more intel on ship type and standings  thats why you have scaner for4 sit back and watch if thats what players realy whant experiance in game and after one week change it back and start resiving feedback
i dont get it
i did hit enter before i writed text
hm a little unrefined but this suggestion is worth a try
not a bad idea tbh
local needs a nerf so no local intel it only matters how to do this
i like it when arguments always come down to some implants someone bought
mmmm why do you wana nerf the bubble soo much its not overpowered at all most ships can go the 20km in under 2 min unless you have a freighter or cap bubbled dictors have already been d to death by the nerf bat my saber dosnt have much for dps or much for speed any more since they nerfd it already what they should do is boost there speed back to where they use to be its a destroyer class ship ment for killin frigs and stuff so why nerf it more then it already is
i understand that many like the nosnuet increase but would a drone and ship bonus work well enougha reduction in the sig radius of both the ship and the drones would make the ship a lot better and increase the tank without changing the basic function of the ship the pilgram would take less damage and would be harder to target making it and its drones more effectivei understand that many think the nosnuet is the way to go but if they introduce any modules down the line that are strong on normal ships then the pilgram will make them unbalanced and you risk goin to bat with the nerf stick again something i believe most would like to avoidbut change the basic damage it takes and adding to the longevity of the drones would make it very much more effectivejust my opinion though
pilgrim needs a range bonus i agreealso i can get a rapier to 200dps a 150dps drone damage bonus is good enough you can actually leave that one alone and just give the pilgi the range bonus it tbh needs to get inline with the rest of the recons
since the new insurance changes are much lauded by the carebear community ccp how about giving back something to the pvpersgankers that make eve so greatlets remove insurance payouts on self destructs too that way ppl who self destruct instead of engage in a fight will now have to think twiceno insurance companies pay you if you deliberately crash your car into something afterall
agreed at least has the merit of coherencemy only problem with this idea is that it doesnt go far enough if were having realistic insurance in eve lets make it actually realistic
i support this as well though i understand why its in the game they made it this way so that when you get locked into place by a griefer who has absolutely no intention of killing you you can escape without an unfair penalty because of some griefers actions
if insurance is going to be realistic it should be removed entirelly but this is a good first step
so how does removing it entirely make it realisticno if it is to be realistic then it needs to be turned over to player corporations to offer or not on the market
its unrealistic in its current implementation that was my point it should either cover everything and be just a game mechanic like it used to be or it should be completely realistic and function like a rl business
agreed
signedalso remove insurance from any global criminals in 05  10 system only makes sense and will make gankers think twice
agreed self destruct should not give insurance payout
great idea this is a no brainer
agree
agreed
negative you will have your friend blow up the ship to get money back self destruct is mostly used in non combat situation in order to return part of the isk blowing the ship up often gives more money than selling it on the secondary market
stop whining and get more dps
yes i support this change i would be glad to tackle people who have no way to kill me and i have no way to kill them unless they log off and just hold them there for hours as i taunt them in local this would be totally awesome
well i did it means most have given up on mining
make that twoi would say increase the cargohold but dont remove haulers entirelyi use drones the rats only got into my armour once and that was because i was disconnected and i guess they shot as i autowarped offi wouldnt mind a reduction here for obvious profitgenerating reasonswhen i rat i tend to do it in a ship equipped to rat the mining barges are not really equipped to rat a small boost here would not be unwelcomeab
it was suggested that i post the folowing suggestions in this forum for discussion the original thread is here my proposition is to ensure that living in hisec never makes anyone rich simple as that1 make all asteroids in hisec only drop veldspar ever period2 make reprocessed modules yield primarily trit with only traces of pye mex iso and nox as in 01 or less combined and never yield the rarer resources3 make all agents in 07 and higher space l2 or lower agents in 05 to 06 l3 and lower no l4 or l5 agents should exist in hisec space this system will allow folks who simply cannot stand pvp in any form to keep plugging away in hisec and now that theyre a bit safer their isks should theoretically last them longer they wont however have as huge an effect on the market without accepting some riskthis will also encourage more folks to get out in lowsec aside from fw activities for higher profits this will make the pirates happy and it will train these intrepid souls in the fine art of survivaladditional suggestionintroduce a chance of concord response in hisec base this chance on the systems security status expressed as a percentile ie 10  100 052  52 increase the likelihood of response by system status10 per additional aggressor past the first ie 1 adidional aggressor in a 05 system  5 chance of concord responsethis will make the transition to lowsec more gradual and would make vastly more logical sense it will also encourage hisec pirates to field cheap ships more easily defended against by newer less experienced players and discourage large pirate fleets in hisecthe difference between participants security status could even be factored in as required this should prevent folks just switching to l3 missions to compensate as the areas where l3 agents will be available will involve some risk
i think you might be surprised if indeed l4 agents were moved to low sec how popular l3 agents would becomewhile some l4 runners would move to low sec i bet just as many or more would stay in high sec and run the l3
edited additional post to reflect concerns over a simple switch to l3 missions
definately would make the game better and more interesting
supported  this would solve the macro problems somewhat too
an interesting an idea i think some fundamental changes to missionsnerf bounty boost isklp rewards for missions in addition to your idea would be greatand to those who say that people will just grind level 3s 6 and 5 sec space is almost always adjacent to lowsec
thats fine as it still helps balance the game
i think your idea is bad simply because it would close the game for new players it would be bad for ccp no new subsribers and it would negatively reflect player base first of all many players who live only in highsec would leave the game permanently and only minority would move to lowsec or 00 second people leave the game all the time because they are bored just got married got a new job or for any other reason and new people start playing the game all the time put yourself in a position of a totaly new player who dont know what the hell is that ecm burst for and than add the fact that hell deal with characters several months or years old with billions in their wallets t2 ships god knows how many millions of skillpoints and months or years of experience and then on top of that add low possibilities of decent isk making in highsec prices of ships and modules controled by old playes and skill prices for capital ships that new players could only dream of it would be discouraging wouldnt it
if people are running l4 agents theyre not that new
omg another i want to gank noobs in ravensretrievers
oh yes even though i havent done any pirating in about 9 months all i want to do is gank noobs in ravens sigh1 survival in lowsec00 has nothing to do with sp its about intelligence and experience which you only get by living there2 if youre running level 4 missions youre not new no one suggested that 2day old osprey miners make too much no one suggested that level 1 kill mission runners make too much its the experienced skilled players that are able to farm isk all day with no risk whatosever ive said it before exploration is almost a perfect model of what missionsmining should be decent money in hisec not enough to finance a lot of expensive  but enough to subsist much better money in lowsec and a bit better than that in 00
erm noso all roids in empire give trit all mods give trit with the extreamly low chance of getting something elsebasicly asking for empire agents to be to lvl2 and lvl3 in lowsec lvl45 in 00and what do you think the market would do since anything other then trit would need to be hauled into highsec from low00 gatecamps would be in force 237 blobing would rise to unheard of levelsallow me to put it a diffrent wayremove npc rats from 00 spacedrop moon mining down to 1100 of current levelsremove agents from lowsec and 00remove plexs from lowsec and 00remove the ability to build ships in lowsec or 00 except super capital classnow look ive just asked for almost everything i can think of that would make you isk at some rate in 00 do you like it im still shocked you cant see the outcome of this tbh empire space isnt just pvp scaredycats or urgh blobites a lot of players in empire help players in 00 not just farm missions
zydrinemegacyte has to be hauled into hisec from 00 at least the majority of it and i dont see these mystical 247 camps on the lowsechisec border systems theyre there but not that often besides if a corp was active in lowsec  then they almost definitely have a combat wing which they could use to contest some of these camps the sky is fallingerm no
your looking at now try to look if these changes were to come into playatm some stuff is hauled from 00 to hisec with this everything would be and since with these changes the market in empire would be controled by lets face it alliances and how much stuff is hauled into highsec space gatecamps would logicaly rise as more and more people will try to get higer end mins into highsec hell ill gatecamp 237 for how much even a t1 hauler full of even scordite would fetch on empire market after thisafter the mass buying the empire market would dry up and be fully under 00 and lowsec players control prices would rise as empire corps would no longer be able to mine in empire or refine loot for ore to build ships something does need looking at but this is just way to stupid to even think aboutwhat hes asking is basicly shut down highsec and make it the  of lowsec and 00 players
this is a very bad idea i am 3 years old and i cant make enough money to get a ship for pvpwith current low sec gate camps heavy interdictors venturing into low sec is a joke 00 is blocked out there is no place to go for many peopleless money isk means that the game will be slow and the pirates will be richdo not do this awful idea
really and you think that the 00lowsec corps are just going to stand by and let you blow up t1 industrals full of loot  no theyll get jump freighters theyll use blockade runners which are immune to lowsec camps when properly fitted btw or theyll just get some guys together and blow through your camp why do you think mining individualscorps are a bunch of mindless drones who dont know how to do anything its not less money its less money for people in hisec if you cant get into lowsec then youre doing it wrong i can and do move in and out of lowsec constantly
i myself do lvl4 missions currently i play the game for almost a year now and still dont have a clue about pvp why because i havent yet accumulated enough isk to realy enjoy pvp im playing that long and have a little more than 700 mil in my wallet because of the real life obligations mostly  everyone have a real life right i admit that im tired of all this miningmission runningratting st who wouldnt be after all and want to get into pvp but i simply feel i dont yet have enough isk to enjoy it and fear that i would be forced to return to my current game style after a while well when i get to pvp i want to stay in pvp period the way i see it much more players will move to 00 and get into pvp if they only have a chance to fill their wallets beforre doing so because in the first month or two depending on how fast one can learn in 00 they will lose great ammount of isk due to inexperiencegiving new players a chance to earn decent isk in highsec will increase the number of pvpers because after a while miningmission running really gets boringafter all i am considering to sell this char for isk create a new one and get into pvp right away the skills are not the main problem if you play smart but one sure needs isk and gaming experience to be a successful pvper
no i expect them to guard teh gate ie camp it with a large force and thus blobbingjust think of all them mission setup ships jumping in all them killmails and loots looks tasty nocorrect and erm who would be in control of the market for my new ships oh look the people in charge of teh gate because the empire market is controlled by them as empire players will be unable to build morethank you for proving my points even if i knew you didnt mean tolowsec and 00 corps will control the market in empire one way or another no matter how you look at iti agree something needs to be done this isnt it
im not the goon you are
you are not supposed to be docked all the time stop inventing new ideas to not undock
bumb for a good idea
i think ur idea has to be the best just to disapointing ccp dnt listen to the players even though we r smarter than them even if we havent or have got the degreese to say we have past the course or crap like that lol d
first of no one cares that people use mwds for close range there fitted so we can catch up to more faster ships and get to snipers easyeir i for one dont want to fit a ab and go like 200 ms or less to get to a sniper or something else and second the complaints were about nanos not close rang so y bring close range ships into this and what about ships like diemos that gets bonuses to mwd u might as well get ride of that bonus since the scram will get rid of it and it very rare u see any nanointy get in range of 10km for a web so how will a 7500km scram with the effect of turning mwds of affect nanos and they still have base speed of wat 200300 ms and they nanos r sure to carry a scram incase they r stupid to get cought in oneand drones allready get destroyed by nanoers so y boost them to catch the nanos since there just going to be destroyed anyway
moar support 
current situationbounty hunting as a profession is all but nonexistent i for one think in a game like eve this should be a viable and fun professionthe current system it very open to exploitation as you can see how much is on your head and get a friend to kill you and share the isk gained and there is no way to make contract killingsmy proposalkill rightsbounty systems need changed1 currently if you are killed by someone outside of 00 you get kill rights where you can kill them on sight without concord intervention whereas many times if you have been killed in the first place its because you lack the shipsiskskill to kill the pirate in the first place  this means kill rights from my experience hardly ever get usedmy idea  that upon destruction of a civilian ship that a token is generated whether this be in the character sheet or an item doesnt really matter at this point this token can then be taken to a bounty office and then used to place a bounty on the targets head token must be entered into the bounty office within a certain timeframe otherwise it expires bounties applied to the same person will be added together to make the bounty larger2the current bounty system is too transparent you can see how much you are worth which can lead to killing yourself through various means for the cashmy idea  the current bounty system need to be changed so that players cant see how much is on their head but that they are just wanted3there is currently no method of contract killing passing your kill rights to others this would make bounty hunting a viable professionmy idea  the bounty office window should be changed so that it does not list the most wanted players but a list of say 10 random bountys with a next arrow to pull up another random 10 these bountys can be accepted like a contract and transfer the kill rights to you for a period of say 3 days in which you have to hunt down and kill they mark otherwise the bounty is returned to the bounty office
guess there are some hotter topics than this one hmmm ok never mind at least i can post my own vote for this one
you know considering how small and easy an application eve is and how easily it tabs you can consider this somewhat unnecessary because you really just have to disable the juke and tab down and put something on a player in the background
shirly yes
as a paying customer the quality of service in this game is going down hill ive had a petition in for 2 days and no reply from the gms it might not be a earth shattering problem to them but to someone who is paying for this service its very frustrating if this is the way ccp want to treat me then i guess i have only one option left open to me and i have to vote with my walletapril
what did you petition exactlysome petitions take one or two weeks regukarly eg ship losses as far as i heardedit wrong forum btw
sorry if its the wrong forum but i didnt know where to put this topic i looked for a forum to voice my opinion against ccp but could not see one i put it in here hoping a member of the council will take up the lack of communications between ccp and its paying customers
the response time is due to heavy load and prioritization stuck petitions are handled firsti got a hunch that a lot of petitions not concerning being stuck are filed as stuck petitons wasing the gms time and yours aswell
objective make the economy more stablemeans npcs to sell dynamicallypriced overpowered consumables to rich playerstheory by imitating a playerpriced bull market an npc would raise prices of their inventory based on how fast their product is sellingimagine that the current best boostercapboosterchargeammoprobeetc is sold for 1x isknow imagine an npc out in space somewhere was selling something 2550 more powerful but at a minimum of 2x isk of the current bestbut that isnt all as the product sells that multiplier grows it grows until fewer and fewer are sold until none are sold and then slowly decaysthis product is for the rich pilots of new eden that have so much isk that they dont know what to do with it this premium advantage comes at a cost to the rich and is actually a kind of tax rebate for all of eveplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesyou see isk comes into the eve system by bounties mission rewards and some other ways theres no limit to the amount of input the more npcs killed the more isk comes into the systemisk exist the system through things like clones insurance pos fuel office rentals industry slots but these values dont grow with the amount of isk in system so they arent very effective at counteracting it upon the superrichand that is fine theres no need to punish the average eve player because some other eve players are fantastically wealthybut to those that are fantastically wealthy they are the people that have so much isk that they can control markets they can buy the rarer necessities at enormous prices thus keeping the prices high and out of reach of the middle class or newbie playersthis is different than simply having wealthy merchants trading bills with other wealthy merchants however this would be wealthy merchants burning their bills the 1000000isk they pay per uberdreadydreaddreadgurista torpedo isnt being moved around the system its exiting the systemhow this would trickledown benefit all of eve1 rich people buy the evercostlier overpowered consumables2 isk exits system and is not traded among market tycoons3 rich people become less rich4 rich people willing to pay less and less for the items that middle class and newbie players are interested in5 disparity between what you are willing to pay and what rich people are willing to pay leverages outthis would happen very slowly and you could not see its effect for years probably but one day somebody might once again shed a tear over losing a battleship when the ultrafat wallets are deflated to within reason
forgot a very important part tiers of luxurytier 1 5 better than current best slowest multiplier growth fastest multiplier decaytier 2 10 better than current best same deal faster multiplier growth than the previous tier slower multiplier decay than the previous tiertier 3 15tier 4 20etc etc the point being that there be a large range of luxury items for the large range of wealthy players and the amount of isk theyre willing to spend on the luxury the better the consumable tier the faster the multiplier grows and the slower the multiplier decaysthis is important because it gives them more luxury options for their isk to leave the system and deflate the wealth in eveand obviously voting yes for myself
i also think its worth mentioning that there are other sides to isk circulation in eve and that this alone doesnt come close to fixing it all though it the total amount of isk in system as well as leverage wealththere are also things like tech 1 ores moon minerals datacores whatever else is a collected commoditythere is potential for those materials to be collected at a greater rate than they are being used this devalues themthough i believe it would be possible to curb their devaluing in a similar way only this time nothing to do with npcsminerals dont have a problem with exiting the system so to speak you blow up a ship minerals leave the system that happens a lot though its possible for players to simply not be blown up fast enough to keep up with the materials being collectedso what i mean by similar way of curbing this is having these materials be useful in a luxury sort of wayconsider higher tiers of tech 1 ship recipes maybe you can take 2 tritanium and make 1 ubertritanium maybe you can take 2 ubertritanium and make 1 uberuber tritanium etc etcand then maybe theres an ubermegathron recipe that has 5 more hp and 5 more damage and an uberubermegathron with 10 more hp and 10 more damageyou get what im sayingthough i believe this would have a much more immediate impact on the economyand this is not part of this threads proposal if i refine this idea ill create a new thread or someone else can and ill vote for you
the fundamental rule of inflation is that if the effective money supply grows faster than the effective goods supply inflation will result and that if the opposite is the case then deflation will result according to the qens the effective goods supply real gup increased by roughly 10 monthly the money supply was 90 trillion75 trillion of which was in active hands and the rate of money supply growth is 171 billion per day or 513 trillion per month for the last periods for which we have data thus growth rate of m1isk in active hands was 68 per month and growth rate of m2isk in game was 57 per month neither of these matches the growth rate of real gup and as such deflation of between 35 per month is implied not inflation this data is well correlated in the four price indices which aside from the wildly variable pppi have been very steadily in the 0 to 5 range for almost every month the last year where we have data im annoyed that the qens stopped since the data im using is rather outdateddec 2007 is the newest but the best data we have says that deflation is the norm and inflation is the result almost entirely of dysprosium shortages especially in the face of the thennew t2 ships in trinity if dreyjog comes out with new data saying that the situation has changed then i might have reason to support an increase in isk sinks to fight inflationthough even then perhaps not  inflation is not inherently bad but until such data is released im going to have to say its fine as it isalso your idea for creating a new sink is to cause artificial shortages as a tool for raising prices kind of ingenious but thoroughly cruel besides this game doesnt need more ways for rich players to pimp themselves out
thanks for the informative reply i sometimes get my verbage mixed up so this doesnt really fight inflation it counters wealth disparity over the lifetime of a game and this helps everyone not really cruel to anyone imo people get what they pay for
chat windows in eve are terribly nerfed and i imagine it has something to do with spamming and simply not having looked at the issue1  character limit for public chat local npc corp none passworded channels is fine for player corp private and intel channels we need to at least triple the character limit2 copying and pasting links doesnt work cause it will paste the code for the link like this urlshowinfo1373161330395kirishimaurl vagabond url make it so that we can directly copy and paste links and it wont be fubared
i wish to get a native client too  current cedegaed implementation works bad with nonlatin languages and in a cosmos space framerate on nvidia videocards is too low  looks like some bug in nvidia driver or in wine then running via wine launching from console multiple messages fixmed3ddrawdrawprimitive using software emulation because not all material properties could be tracked spamming console then running offical client no console but same low fps seems there is no problem with ati cards

its really fun to hear a goon talk about gamebreaking but anywaythat theres no reason not to do it doesnt mean you should do it just because i mean have you ever eaten your toenail clippings its not unhealthy for you it probably doesnt even feel or taste that bad but is it something youd think of doing just because you can
i agree that eve is a niche game but i strongly suspect that the reason there are so many wow clones out there is financial  more people are willing to pay the monthly fee for themthe bottom line is that ccp are a company companies exist to make money they can have other goals but the moneymaking is the important one  if they fail at that then there is no more company i dont know or care actually if ccp are publicly owned but whether they are or not there will be money guys somewhere even if eve is doing very nicely and earning a tidy sum there will be constant pressure against those holding the vision tm by those holding the cash who can see that making the game more wowfriendly will get them more subscriptions and give them more cash to hold on to and the ones holding the cash tend to be far more senior something very similar happened in soe regarding everquest  the ones with the vision tm lasted for a few years but were eventually removed from the equation by the corporate musclei would be the first to admit that i am an empirehugging carebear if ship customisation was allowed i may as well tie pink ribbons onto my megathron fly around with alvin and the chipmunks on the stereo and have a barbie doll as my ship mascot however eve needs an dark edge to make it work and i dont think a consensual pvp version of eve would be fun at all even though i do not pvp at allhowever i dont think that prettier ships and the playing of musical instruments makes eve a less harsh game  you can play the sousaphone all you like but your custompainted ship can still get blasted to its component atoms the moment it leaves dock i do think its important to address scams that are the result of failures in the code eg in the real world would you spend 400000 on a new house if the only details about it you could see are that its detatched has 3 bedrooms and a nice location unlikely scams where the scamee is just being dense and not careful though those should definitely be fair game
i agree 100eve is getting too fluffyrecent nano changes ok i can dig that it was bit out of hand but nothing any person whit a brain couldnt handlenow the suicide gank thing another move to make eve pink and cuddlyi dont want hello kitty online id like eve online to stay eve onlineatm it seems ccp is on the course of making eve easier and ppl who have been playing mmos for a while know where this leads it leads to a balanced game that noone plays because its to easy nothing is rewarding and everything is the same
with recent changes it looks like ccp intends to cater only to the carebear crowd so i doubt they listen but you got my support
cant support this sorry looks like you are trying to find more noobs and nonpvpers to gankab
qfti like the characters i play to be unusual and different from the crowd i dont want to be able to do a slightly toned down version of tasks a b c in return for a slightly better ability to do tasks x y z i would prefer to be completely unable to do tasks a b c and x in return for being good at y and the games best class at zgames where everyone can go everything are monstrously dull players will always whine about making the game easier but in the end complexity is the key to subscription retention the alternatives are that someone pays for 4 or 5 months of an easy game and then gets bored and leaves or they pay for 2 or more years for a challenging gamewe dont play mmos for a quick win and easy goals  thats what single player games are for
well i would not say noone will play it wow proves you wrong but for me at least i cant be arsed with such a mmorpg singleplayer games do that a lot better
doesnt make sense there are no nonpvpers in this game just people who are bad at it
not sure i agree here i havent bothered with rat specific hardeners in i have no idea i just dont bother with them and do fine in l3 missions in a nondrake battlecruiser specifically an armor tanked hurricane though its a rare l3 that even gets through my sheildsadding randomness into the missions would force pve players to pick up some of the skills that pvp people take for granted flexibility preparing for the unknown etc it would also make them less of an easy mark to any passing pvper who can guess their setup by the wreaks around them
fixing bugs is one thing changing mechanics to make life easier for people who have chosen a safe way of living in highsec is another i think the latter is detrimental to the overall spirit of eve it tells us that the developers want people to be able to avoid pvp all together that it should be voluntary once upon a time gateguns and concord were nonexistent we are far away from those days and the change has always gone in the direction of softening the blow for the people who prefer safety before danger sure highsec is supposed to have high security but when it becomes so easy on the newbs that live there and that they still can make plenty of isk there makes for a situation not all too unsimilar to what a certain benjamin franklin said he who sacrifices essential liberty for security deserves neithercome on if you want a completely safe pond for newbs let them have eg 10systems for the first month of play but dont keep going in this direction i implore you

you will also find that the energy transfer module copy times have also increased by a factor of 60yes nos  energy transfer have gone from 1 min per run to 1 hour for large and 30m for mediumthus this makes inventing them completely impossible giving the bpo owners the competition free market that was enjoyed prior to the introduction of inventionheres the bug report

totally agreed which is why all players should be given a permanent link into an isk bank with unlimited fundsyou know so they can buy the best ships right off the bat and enjoy the fun from day onesarcasm
no reinforcement timers on my ships darius and they arent indestructible either i also dont get to deny my enemies the use of capital ships through the deployment of 7m isk module with 16m hitpoints 00 is currently the purview of people with everything their own way defensively dont act surprised about it when people suggest you are playing eve on easy mode
can you point me to the reinforcement timers on my ships no concord in my space its a free for all you dont always get to pick and choose whether to engage having space police there to make sure youre only attacking approved targets is hardly what id call hardcoreedit if it was easy youd probably be capable eh
in case you hadnt noticed theres a sum total of one combat capable cap ship in highsec and thats the veldnaught
who needs space police when you have pos shields to hide behind eh its a silly argument darius and goes nowhere what is apparent is that eve is getting more polarized between space ship pvp empirelowsecnpc sov and pvpos sov space where the ability to produce a blob is the only requirement for success still we wont agree on this and its pointless arguing on the forums
calling it a silly argument doesnt make it so my pos shields dont spawn spontaneously out of nowhere you could blob someone just as easily in empire as you could in 00 i have no idea what you think your platform is here but it doesnt seem to be based in reality are we perhaps talking about a different game
on the subject of empire wars vs nullsec wars fleets fights go much smoother when you dont have to worry about losing ships to concord because they accidentally shot a vulture sightseer or other assorted bystanders its also not so fun when a hostile fleet docks up to avoid your superior or equal force and you have to either move on hoping that they dont get more numbers and backstab you later or camp them and then youre playing age of smacktard call of youtube or world of forumcraft instead of playing eve at least lag is a factor in both instances but it comes from different sourcesdamn darius i know youre utterly consumed by 00 warfare but youre not exactly playing eve the only way its meant to be played
ladies ladies empire and 00 warfare are both as crap as each other
epic thread hijack 
indeed
i know its obviously meant to be played hiding in stations ing about getting suicide ganked or having your can flagged a little thing i like to call hardcore modesarcasm aside we do have occasional empire wars they simply dont suit me i try to shy away from calling any playstyle the right playstyle but if someone else is going to lay down the bait ill bite
poasting in a darius vs jade thread also the op is a moron
the csm voted against the nano nerf on sunday my understanding was that once you voted against an issue you didnt bring it up again
that was the csms understanding yes jade likes to try to change the rules when he doesnt get his way
you know if you really step back and look at what you are doing it does not make a lot of senseyou are ed because nozh whacked the nanos with a nerf sledge i think it is a bit heavy handed but seriously how can you throw a logical argument at ccp when you have no fn clue what they are actually going to change you do not have any of their data you do not sit in the room with them having discussions about what works or does not hey your not a dev i would not second guess a guy that likes to swing that damn nerf bat its like trying to do the same job twice dont blow it the first time around by ing them off to the point they tell you to go get bent the next time you bring it upthe only reason i see this is getting pushed through is because this issue has high visibility and will help in the reelection process when it comes around again
sisi oh look i just demolished your argument
really so tell me what are nozh findings what has he come up with have you ever noticed when they do a big test on sisi it usually is not the same as when it hits tq or some of the content never hits so you are guessing
this would be because the devs would like the players to test the changes on sisi then provide them with feedback directly so that they can make a more informed decision thats just a crazy shot in the dark though and not at all exactly what the devs have asked for
 inanna zuni  permanentlyand thats my personal last recollection of the issue
fair enough you know as well as i do that the vote will fail but if we didnt have an agreement i really cant be angry about that i can say its bad form and that the councils not happy with it but go ahead and have it your way v0vsee you in 2 weeks when it fails by a higher margin time well spent i say
well maybe it does darius but end of the day we have a lot of players feeling very passionately that the csm should be addressing the speed issue and id like to be able to tell those people that we are considering it and have been testing sisi and will help to the make the arguments needed to get ccp to reach the right balance in the patch id rather get humiliated and voted down 72 in the csm that i would just stand by and not even try to do the right thing if we cant act from principle in the virtual politics of a mmorpg itd be a pretty poor thing really
spare me the walking against the wind bull if we spend every meeting voting on the same issues we get nowhere this isnt a game issue yet the players have been given a channel directly to the devs to address this issue by the devs the csm should be focusing on the game that actually existsthe right thing is to respect the vote we already had
cant you two see that youre in love
thread
as a man of the roid i could act as the celebrant during the next csm meeting aka jade  darius weddingill be setting up a gift registry in the eve store
i wonder why the member of the large entrenched spaceholding alliance is so in favour of the nano nerfs that would make their life a lot easier hmm why is that
bear in mind that the csm wasnt voting on whether the nerf was a good idea but on whether they should issue a unified statement on the changesconsidering how wide reaching the proposed changes actually are and the sheer number of changes involved are you surprised that they couldnt come to an agreement over this especially given that within the playerbase itself there are heavy divisions as to how this issue should be approached even to the degree of agreeing with some changes but not others youd have to debate each change individually instead of as a whole then debate the changes as they affect each otherthis would be one of the first times ive seen a csm vote where the vote was deadlocked with neither enough votes for escalation 5 votes for nor enough votes to deny escalation 5 votes against id be interested to know what mechanisms you have in place to resolve such issues in future though at the moment returning it to the full csm 9 for further discussion does seem the most prudent course of action so that a vote can be done to definately set the csms position in one direction or another
well gabriel its not so much a matter of needing enough votes to deny escalation  its just about whether something gets the 5 votes needed to support escalation if it doesnt get 5 supports it fails
it fails on a tie as is standard for any venue that doesnt have a tiebreaking vote i remember a few big ones in student government that did that and of course theres canadian abortion law which doesnt exist because the replacement law failed on a tie in the senatebecause the acting speaker didnt know he could vote oddly after the first one was struck down
canadian politicians ftw
thus the reason theres an odd number on the council i believe at the time there were two alternates active unfortunately if everyone doesnt attend not calling anyone out just stating a fact we wont have the optimal voting arrangementi find it pretty hilarious that some dude itt tried to allude to our being a large entrenched 00 alliance having anything to do with the nano issue firstly it wasnt a year or two ago we were small and new secondly my guys are just as split over this as anyone else gabriel hit the nail on the head when he said why the vote was shot downit seems virtually every time i vote against something people pull out the goon card which is pretty hilarious given that i have voted at times in opposition to their wishes if we can take a step back from the koolaid and narcissism maybe we can accept the fact that i simply think somethings a bad idea as opposed to an attempt to cling to some vested interest i dont even like my own space to be frank its just a facet of the game and theres not been any better alternatives presented
youre either involved in 00 sov warfare and are assumed to be furthering your own agenda or not involved at all and proposed ridiculous solutions to fake problems sigh
ties in westminster legislatures are vanishingly rare and if i recall the story correctly the guy wasnt the actual speaker meaning hes not expected to know the rules as well he thought he had the tiebreaking vote but it tuned out that if he wanted to vote he had to do it at the same time as everybody else which he failed to do hence a tie hence abortions are legal until the actual moment of childbirth in canadaa unique situation in the western world since for various reasons i wont go into here nobody has tried to change that in the 18 years since anyways ill stop hijacking the thread and just finish making the point i raised the example to make  votes fail on a tie hence a 9man committee but that doesnt work so well when there are 6 absences among the 95 of them

agreed it seems a silly limitation without explanation
my preference is for a freightertype ship ie no fitting slots that is nothing but hangar and a small cargo bay make it gate friendly no drones so its harmless and people will have the option to transport ships as their desire with little fuss and theres already a system in place for dealing with carriers that pop with ships aboardfor bonus points make it an interbus ship

its a slippery slope wardecs are currently a freeform tool for corps to use against each other their use and victory conditions being playerdetermined replacing that playerdefined versatility with gamedefined goals removes all freeform use of the wardec system the new system has to cover all of the current uses of the system or it will not be wellrecieved but it is simply not possible for gamedefined mechanics to cover all of the uses that people currently have for wardecs how exactly would a gamedefined goal system handle a goal of get an apology from their ceo for insulting our ceo it cantccp have a history of developing eveonline in the direction that players are already using it when players started forming corporate alliances ccp introduced alliance mechanics to the game to help support it when it became aparant that players unilaterally used local for spotting friendlieshostiles ccp introduced standings icons in local chat to help support that there are a ton of other examples that all serve to establish a popular game design trend that has been key in eves longterm success they develop eve in the direction its played rather than try and force players to play a certain waythis proposed change is a complete 180 turn from that ethos rather than providing players with tools that help them do what they are already doing this is forcing players to play the war game the way ccp wants many players have screamed go back to wow etc at this and while they may be expressing their points ineloquently they do have a good point other mmos will design strict game systems and force players to play the game the exact way it was intended eve has always let players determine how they want to play within a loose set of game rules removing that choice and forcing players to play the war game the way ccp wants removes a huge chunk of the social darwinism that characterises eve and sets it apart from the standard mmo norm youre literally cutting out a huge part of eves unique and harsh character as a gamein a moment i will write up a suggestion of my own as to how the wardec system could be revamped without removing any of its current uses and without removing the social darwinism inherent in eve ill keep in mind the goals that it appears ccp wants to achieve it might take a little while ill post it as a reply when im done for now i do not support this thread or notionedit how did i miss this thread for a whole month oo hope someone actually reads my suggestions anyway  in addition i personally believe that any developer who considers nonconsentual pvp to be griefing needs to be taken off this particular project eve is largely built around nonconsentual pvp and the cases where it becomes griefing are few and far between
if small corps get in a war against their will why dont they simply join an alliance being in an alliance will make sure they are no longer a tiny target their attackers will either have to fight all of the alliance or none of itit has been argued alliances are too expensive for starting corporations but that only really applies to starting the alliance instead of starting a new one the whole point would be to join an existing allianceeven though i would like to see this option removed players now also have the option of leaving for an npc corp which also gives them war immunitya downside of using alliances would be that starting wars yourself becomes next to impossible but i would say that is only fair considering why youd be joining this type of alliance
revamping war mechanicsin these posts i offer a plan for how the war system can be revitalised to provide a better gameplay experience for all corps involved in writing this i will attempt to solve three core issues expressed by ccp and the csm and i will be holding a final fourth consideration in mind based on my own experience1  wars currently have no victory conditions or goals the defender also has no way to force an end to the war no matter how powerful their corp is this is undesirable2  attackers can keep up wars indefinitely against easy targets this is undesirable3  wars against small corps are usually skewed in favour of the attacker making it more difficult for new corps to get organised in safety before they can be targetted and wiped out as with the first point this is undesirable4  the war system must not be restricted from its current uses any new system must augment the old one rather than replace itsolving point 1  war goalsthink of this like the contracts system but for wardecs the attacking corp would issue their wardec along with goals terms of surrender if the defending corp meet the surrender terms the war is ended this is something that people do currently in a nonformal manner with no controls and no guarantees but the new system could help formalise the agreement like contracts did for trade for example if someone kills my shiny new megathron in a 04 system i might currently wardec their corp and demand 120m reimbursement to drop the wardec instead of me evemailing the ceo and demanding isk what if the wardec system allowed me to specify that formally as a surrender termthe defending corp could click a surrender button to agree to the wars terms and 120m would be transferred from their corp to mine the corp that surrendered then gains a temporary immunity to wars from my corp and any alliance that they join in that time will inherit the restriction this immunity represents a formal peace agreement between the two corps which is enforced by concord this is just one type of war that people currently enact on each other ccp will need to examine the reasons people currently declare war on each other and try to make formal surrender terms that fit as many of those reasons as possibleto prevent a corp simply retracting the war so they dont give their enemies a peace agreement peace agreements will always be issued when a war ends no matter how it ends unpaid bill retracted or surrender terms met the attacker would select the length of the peace agreement when he creates the wardec from a minimum of one month up to a maximum of six months surrender conditions should be modifiable midwar since ceos currently often renegoatiate surrender terms midwar the defender may be able to issue his own counteroffer eg 90m for that megathron loss discussed earlier and the attacker could accept it the new surrender terms would replace the old ones and the defending corp could then agree to the new termsthe key thing to remember here is that were designing the new system to do formally what the old one did informally all weve done is design a tool to enhance the war system as it is currently used and provide formal surrender and peace conditions the defenders will now have a formal way to agree to end to hostilities and the peace agreement gives a corp an incentive to accept surrender terms if they are reasonablein addition to formal goals freeform goals are an essential requirement social terms for surrender cannot possibly ever be covered by game mechanics so a freeform surrender term system similar to freeform contracts will be required players could type in any terms at all like i want bill to issue a formal apology to joe for calling him a noob and the attacking corp would declare if and when the terms were met at that point the war would end and peace would be declared
solving points 2 and 3  war costscurrently a 50man corp declaring war on a 5man corp costs the same amount as in reverse but the war is skewed in favour of the larger corp another consideration is that war costs have dropped over the years while the 26m costs are the same as they always were isk generation abilities have increased significantly since 2005 war costs are now pocket change a formality that most attackers dont even care about these two factors combined means that attackers can choose easy targets and keep the wars active indefinitely small corps have very few choices they can join an alliance to increase next weeks wardec fee to 50m go into hiding and hope their enemies will get bored or simply disband the corp none of these is an ideal solution when a small fledgling corp is wardecced by a much larger forcethis problem will be solved by redesigning the wardec fee system rather than basing the wardec fee on the number of active wardecs it will be based on the number of active pilots in the defending corp the number of active pilots is defined as those who have been online in the past month and the reason to use this metric for pricing is simple using a plain pilot count rather than an active pilot count means corps would be encouraged to boot inactive members to alter war costs which they shouldnt have to pilots who havent logged in for a month cannot possibly be part of the corps war effort and should not be taken into account when determining how combateffective the corp should be since fees are only reassessed once a week for each war making an active player count should be very feasible on cpu time and can be done during downtimethe fees themselves would be scaled based on the difference between the active player counts in both corps for example a corp of 50 versus a corp of 50 could cost 10mweek while a corp of 50 against a corp of 5 could cost 100mweek and so be infeasible likewise a corp of 50 declaring war on a corp of 100 could cost them only 5mweek the new system encourages warmongers to declare war on larger corps to get more targets for a cheaper price it also makes costs infeasibly high for very large corps picking on smaller ones to attack smaller corps a warmongering corporation would need to split into smaller groups that are more easily resisted giving the smaller corps a fighting chancealliance fees could be calculated the same way using a total of the active pilots in all member corps and then multiplied by a factor using the above price scheme of 10m for an equal number war a factor of about 5 is appropriate a minimum fee of 50mweek for wardeccing an alliance should be maintained this way small corps could not declare war on alliances on the cheap but massive corps declaring war on small alliances could have to pay over 50mweekupholding point 4point 4 is something i strongly believe in having followed eves development for over four years i am confident that one of the major contributing factor in its success has been how the game is developed to support what the players do rather than telling us how to play ccp has always just given us the tools and let us play the way we want that sandbox style is one of eves greatest attributes and its particularly important that the core game mechanics remain as tools in a sandboxapart from balance issues with flavour of the month setups being adjusted ccp has never really sat down and told us how to play their game nor should they its a sandbox and it should stay that way faction warfare had a hint of it with the victory points and system capturing but even that didnt go to plan for example despite ccp designing the faction warfare system capturing game the gallente militia are largely ignoring captures in favour of good pvpthe war system described supplements and rebalances the war system rather than replacing it this upholds point 4
in that bit they stat there is no safe way to be in a small group and that the base size of corporation determins who u can war dec is what i got from it correct me if im wrongdoesnt this conflict with th first of my quotes i mean 2 small corps at war the targeted corp sellsauctions there war decs to a twice as big merc corp isnt that abit overpowered and u dnt exactly see adolf  auctioning of his war with the world when he was loosing did u lol
i really dont see a problem with the current system tbh ive been on both the giving and recieving end of empire wardecs and that is something that makes this game good there is no safe space dont make it too soft
see my signature
this is also my opinion on the matteradditionally the implementation of victory conditions or something to that effect will detract from the freeform nature of war declarations and ultimately dilute the sandbox nature of eve
i propose that ccp put all lvl 4 missions in 00 all lvl 3 missions in low sec and all lvl two missions in 7 sec or lower the higher the sec status the lower levels of missions because that is were the easy jobs are and the harder jobs are closer to the border of an empires space or going out of their space to do missions for them this would help fix the balance for riskreward also change the size of empire roids so that they pop from one or two cycles of a strip miner and limit how much ice spawns on roids in empire saying that the country in charge mines so much of it off size of roids increases as you move to lower sec status areasthe rp reason for agents moving is that with the war and other things going on they have greater need near the borders of their space this means that the newest agents they keep close to home and their more trusted agents they move and spread farther out the roids decreasing in size would be caused by the empires expanded industrial needs during the wartime

supported but i think maybe a bit drastic make l4s scattered across low sec and 00 perhaps have a few very low quality l4 agents in hi sec but preferably not i believe that l3 missions staying in hi sec would be fineregarding roidsores something needs to be done with the market the low end ores veldspar are stupidly profitable in comparison to lowsec ones
sounds like a better idea than some of the others put forward regarding balancing the riskreward
making asteroids contain less than a strip miner cycle in 10 would encourage more experienced players to move away from the starter zones in their hulks that sit there and hoover a belt dry leaving better pickings for newer players in our mining destroyers and cruisers

simple commonsense and a change that has been obviously required for a long timei say this as someone who runs missionsif all the level 4 agents move to losec the danger from pirates will be proportionately less where there are only a few decent agents in losec they are easily camped where there are dozens less easily and less frequently
a few 15 to 20 level 4 agents in border hisec systems
as an outsider to high sec mission running and having minimal experience of it i am perfectly qualified and can be completely objective on this issue unlike all those who run missions in both high sec and low sec every daysigned
copying my response from this threadobviously i dont support it

while i actually agree with the idea not sure i agree with all of the tone in fact im not even sure it would be a good idea in generalif you move l4 missions to low and null sec some people will keep making cash notably null sec alliances like the goons but most people who currently run l4 missions will simply stopas long as death effects how quickly you gain sp since death destroys implants and implants are a huge factor in sp gain you will have many people unwilling to risk going into low or null sec this is esp true of casual players that dont have the isk to replace even the moderately priced implants on a frequent basissure one can grind an evening of l4 missions to pay for a new set of 4 implants but when you can only run a few l3s per week then you start talking about a month or more of grinding to either set a set asside in which case you have to stop pvp till you can afford another or you have the reduced sp gain which esp for a new player is a big deal since they are already scrambling to get their skills in line so they can access game contentmoving the good stuff out of highsec would be a great idea but as long as sp and death are coupled like they are now you are going to have people who just cant be convinced the risk is worth it since they dont play enough for the reward to offset the fixedprice risk they facenow if they were decoupled say reduce jumpclone cooldown to an hour or something or removable learning implants then yay l4 missions in low sec

you know its pretty easy to avoid losing your pod if youre not in 00
this thread is called meet goonswarm and their alts who actually block out all 00 for anyonewell i just want zydrine and mercoxit asteroid belts in high sec then lvl 4 missions will not matter to me
i agree
good idea
good idea
when did we take over the entire 00 mapoh wait we didnt
support not necessarily for the specific changes proposed but definitely for a reduction in the rewards of empire ratting should not be the only major income benefit when moving into more dangerous space
honestly this was just a simple idea people also have to realize people would build communities etc in their section of space and could police it them selves in 00 like cva do their would be npc sov space so people dont have to worry about not being able to dock and about having to take care of poss
supporting dis here
supporting this or something like it risk should equal reward

absolutly worth some devtime
id first like to point this out very seriously as an amarr pilot in an abaddon if you decided to go 2 trimark 1 ccc or 3 trimark and say 1 heavy cap booster and 2 cap recharger iis your still not cap stable infact most amarr ships would become near useless and no race needs cap stability more since it directly affects dps  tank unlike caldari or minmatar with low or no cap usage and gallente with drones the amarr need that strong cap backbone
he specifically said he doesnt want to reduce or eliminate their effects he just thinks that effects that generic are poor design for rigs and should be avoided in future and that narrower rigs should have bigger bonuses in order to make them worthwhile
exactly  in furtherance to your point the churchwarden would it not be great for amarr if energy discharge elutriation was way better than ccc it would be much easier to become cap stable on an abaddon if you could eat into the guns cap use directly rather than just boosting overall recharge you can do it now but the ccc has no penalty and the ede has too small a bonus if the ede had a big bonus then itd be the choice id also completely disagree with the idea that amarr would be useless if cccs were nerfed  what pvp abaddon fits a ccc or a cap recharger thats not a relevant point but like i say i dont want ccc nerfed i want to see it a poor choice to use ccc except on boats that need cap for lots of things  eg a capital ship that needs it for jumping tanking shooting remote repping a boat like an abaddon that uses cap for only one thing or mostly one thing would benefit from ede rig being very useful
nicely written and worthy of discussion imho
i agree
well thought out ideas deserves discussion

these proposals have my support the crap rigs are one of those things ccp will fix eventually whether its this winter if they start looking at it now or in 2 years when a dev happens to notice how bad some of them are while playing on the test server deimos speed buff anyone id prefer it be sooner rather than later
id sign it just for this however all of your ideas are sound and just happen to be stuff ive voiced myself prior

drone obedience not only on attack targets ive also run into an issue where some drones failed to return to bay when told so had a pair fail to get into the drone bay on repeated commands but when i sent all out of the bay the two naughty drones did return when i told all to get in the drone bay
havent seen the firstannoyed by the second
one of those ages old problems that just never got fixed cheers if this leads to some action or at least some serious thought from ccp
good idea would retain eves manual piloting subgame and restrain blobbing by forcing players to setup fleet maneuvers
signed for sure
yes
maybe someone has already said this but cant the vaga not shoot with its mwd on and hit the broadside of a sun anyway whats the difference
better than the terrible changes in the dev blogalthough anyone saying the vaga cant hit for much with its mwd active has no clue whatsoever about what theyre talking about andor have never actually flown it
good idea
against this makes it actually much easier for nano ships to disengage as following ships cannot put pointswebs on them
what about you go back to page one and actually read what is stated there 
this gets my vote only for being a far simpler solution than the one on sisi
fantastic idea
im passing on this post from sarmaul as his account is currently inactive
why the hell not hopefully this also cutz down on the whine threads
its not made clear there what is meant by weapons are ecmscramswebs weapons  is an interdiction sphere launcher a weapon 
looking back at the op i can kinda see how you might have been confused by the wording to clarify the proposal is to cause all damage dealing devices to stop dealing damage while the mwd is activeany modules that do not inflict damage would not be affected
so a curse can still neut inties following it 
yes but you raise a good point and thatd be something that would need to be looked at with testing on sisi and possibly adjusted perhaps add neuts to the list of affected modules after testing some other polishing may have to be looked at as well to tie up other loose endsthe possible inclusion of the mwd reactivation time to prevent exploiting slow rof weapons has already been mentionedas has been mentioned many times in this thread combat inties would need to be looked at and if the ab buff isnt enough to make them viable a role bonus to allow weapon use with the mwd might be an optiondrone behavior would be another thing to keep an eye on its possible that the ability of drones to accept new targets and move towards their target while the mwd is going might be overpowered further testing would be required
totally support this idea
this is a really smooth solutionneuts would need playing around with and testing curse would be hard to tackle but it has always been hard to tackleit really neatly solves the problem people have with nano ships with these changes you have no excuse for your intys not getting them tackled so your heavy hitters can kill themsupport
excellent idea
i wanted to add my support if a tackler catches a vagabond trying to disengage by mwd the vagabond can use its guns again to wtfpwn the ceptor like its meant to
great idea signed
so simple so easy i have always maintainedsarmaul  ccp
much better than ccps idea
i like this idea
i support this it tames speeds doesnt eliminate speed as a method of tanking and doesnt completely destroy ancillary things that the current ccp proposal does
fantastic
much better idea than the nano nerf but could use a few tweaks i think turrets should be allowed to fire with the mwd on since alot of blasterboats and vagabonds rely on it im not a missile ship person so i cant respond to how this would affect missile ships certain drone ships would be a bit ed by it too dominixmyrmvexor as they cant launch drones on the approachon a second thought this would break alot of things toowhat about this if a ship surpasses 25kms it will not be able to use launchersdronesturrets this should not be applied to interceptorsfrigsafsdictors
worst idea ive seen for fixing the speed problem
gtfo sac pilot
domimyrmvexor can still launch drones on approach they will just do 0 damage as long as you got your mwd on blasterboats can point and web their target and just have to pulse the mwd on and off depending on their range to target surely this alternative beats going 800ms lol
could you please elaborate on why you disapprove of this idea are there specific tactics you think it will harm too severely or do you think that it doesnt go far enough in restricting tactics you consider overpoweredthe more detail you can give the better
i like the general idea details need to be worked on but this is good
great ideas i definitely see this as being a much better way of going about dealing with excessive speed and a great overall change to tactics definitely supported
another thread that concerns this and which needs a little lovei still support this threads subject though and id love to hear diniques suggestions
thank you sarm however i feel this solution is far to elegant and far to much work has already gone into ccps solution for them to scrap it le sigh we can hope right
yeea much better
yes why should a pirates life be made easier which is basically why youre asking for this 5 chance of you killing a miner as opposed to almost 100 chance of him getting away most definitely odds ftwi say again work for your target miners already have enough to do to attempt to prevent being blown up imoab
ok why dont you go break down what you have to do to avoid being blown upyou warp to a belt most often times if your mining in 00 you have a pos in system but for the sake of argument lets say your ninja mining and you dont have a tower in either case your work ammounts to dropping into a belt aligning back to your safe spot or tower and activating your mining lasers you then watch local carefully and as soon as it shows a neutral or red person jump into local you initiate warp to your ss or your tower and you are safeboy that sure was a lot of hard work you put into keeping yourself safe wasnt itcompletely balanced also note this does in fact make the hunters life harder too as it stands now we jump in and start scanning trying to narrow down where you are as fast as possible some have it down pretty good others not so good lets say your average and you take 30 seconds to locate a target in a belt you warp to it now this is not 30 seconds since you landed in system its more like 40 or so from load in thats how long your name has been in localjust fyi in 40 seconds you can align a titan for warp so you warp to the belt hoping only to find as you drop out of warp the guy is gone and now your picking him up on scan at a moon or hes gone entirely having cloakedthe only reason we scan at all now is because we see you in localif local were to be removed wed actually have to hunt the systems as wed have no idea if you were in the system at allcertain larger systems like d4k would become bastions to miners with their huge size it would take an age to scan for targets but at least we would have a chancelocal for empire no problem maybe the billboards broadcast some high end frequency or some rp crap like that but for 00 it should not be thereyour all like hey we got it rough you should have to work for your kills yea how often do you actually loose miners and ratters in 00 if you have enough sense to just watch localnever thats how often short of himher going afk there is absolutely no way to catch a ratter or miner in 00 because as soon as they see local they vanish to safety
no do not remove local
finding ships in space should be a challenge it will take planets moons and everything to a whole new level covert ops will have a rolekilling a ship will not be as easy as before currently being secretive and stealthy is broken people monitor local by local spikes making an rapid assualt impossiblemoving in a large fleet can not be done queitly covert ops stelathbombers and recons are a jokepeople leave afk alts on every gate just to monitor local activity which is not right either local intelligence gets abusedspace should be private and give no information about objects in spacealso sensor strenght should have something to do with scan capabilities ships need different onboard scanner sensitivity this will make dedicated hunting ships more viable in finding a target while gank bs should not be able to scan very far this will add versatility to gameplay
nice argument you have thereway to support your views
the topic is becoming more and more important with recent proposed changes
terrible ideas every single one are we supposed to give up flying the ships we like flying in favour of frigates from now on thats what youre leading us to with these suggestions
that pretty much sums it up as much as i hate missions theres not a chance id keep playing they got nerfed to hell and beyond for no reason at all
but you wont make a lot oh and lets not forget that you can always have other traders undercut overcut your buy orders
conservative numberspostulatesa single agent can serve 175 concurrent players at any given time lag limita player can make 20 million isk per hour i can make more but lets call it 20m doing missions for a level 4 agenttherefore each level 4 agent can provide earnings of 3750 million isk per hour call it a round 90 billion isk per daythats not for all hi sec level 4 agents thats for each one of themi realise that this figure may come as a surprise  it certainly astounded me i knew that they were money fountains but i didnt properly appreciate the magnitudeby way of comparison a very very good 00 ratting system might  and this is best case on a good day  be able to produce 100120mhr such systems 095 true sec 10 belts are very rare indeed that is 130th of the value of the hisec level 4 agentthe very best regions of player sov space are worth less in earning potential than 23 hisec level 4 agents the vast majority of 00 systems will in fact struggle to provide a ratter with 10mhr thats per uninterrupted hour most regions are worth less than a single level 4 agentif i had to guess id say that the caldari agents alone are worth more than the ratting value of the whole of player sov 00 space probably much morefeel free to work over the math  i have rounded in favour of 00 ratting and taken more conservative values than my own experience suggests for missioningbut even if the ratio is halved it demonstrates that hisec is absurdly lucrative compared to 00 oh  and thats before risk factors are taken into account  that swings the balance even more heavily towards empire missioners dont have to pay tax x up for alliance ops get ganked safespot move assets in and out of 00 pay 00 prices for shipsmodsammo etc etc i havent bothered including those factors because they dont really make much difference the balance is so absurdly out of kilter already it doesnt matterempire isnt full because people hate 00 its full because thats where the isk is

the goals would be in my opinion give miners back their role as the source of minerals while refining loot should not be made impossible it should not be widely regarded as a contender to the defacto mineral solution an amazing amount of minerals can be produced just by a couple of nights ratting in 00 if they will be up to the task is another matter but im willing to bet that a lot of people start mining if the profits go up it might be boring to some but semiafk mission running isnt exactly a thrill ride either make the t1 market more of a possibility for low sp industrialists although high sp chars could undercut the prices i doubt they will since t2 should be more profitable for them if they are not then thats another issue low sp chars build should be able to get some decent prices for their items make mission running a little less profitable not sure this should be a goal but people are talking about itissues refining trading market will collapse or at least be severely nerfed effictively reducing the demand for t1 items mineral acquisition becomes harder and expensive prices go up pvp combat especially fleet warfare becomes much more expensive insurance covers less t1 items will cost more mineral locations might become very inconvient and disrupting this could actually be good for haulers and pirates as it could increase traffic through low sec areasthere is a lot more to it but these are just the things off the top of my head it will reduce the standard of living for some and be benificial for others i dont think the loot should be totally dropped just reduced so that it cant produce nearly enough to satisfy demand dropping modules or bpcs for producing named items might even be rewarding for both mission runners and industrialistsi dont think it should be a requisite to keep the eve universe stagnant change brings oppertunity and keeps things interesting
i dont know that a complete removal would be the ideal solution but at least a significant reduction in drops i think is needed right now theres not much incentive for mission runners to buy modules from the industrialists as they can get nearly all the modules they need and better ones than producable t1 from wreck drops on a similar note nerf drone ores p either way industrialists and minerals are really only useful overall for t2 modules ships and consumables ammo etc though ships drop a fair amount of it as well the vast majority of resources of all levels should come from the minerindustrialist chain not mission runners and ratters
agree
oh jeez um iwow this one bears a lot of thinking about but generally i would have to support it salvage mining missioning manufacture and piracy should be the primary influxes of isk and really the t1 loot dropping doesnt fit in anywhere therestill dont take it out completely and everywhere not unless you find out after a while that its required for things to work i mean there are characters within missions or certain things that require tags or such that lead to drops or loots of m3m4 items these things require a bit of effort so keeping these to a degree might be good
the idea of getting influence points for mining jumping or even just ship presence terrible ideaskills and moon control fine all that other bs no way come on amend that stupid  out and you have a good ideayou should still be required to put up at least 1 control tower to have any say in the system otherwise you have nothing to defend and nobody can contest your claim to dominancehowever pos spamming shouldnt have a say whether you have 1 or 20 pos up should not effect claim to dominance of a systemso sov warfare would work like this you put up 1 tower activate some special module that would make it contest sov or else allies would be perpetually stealing sov from each other and then kill kill kill influence points push your influence over the other parties involved you gain sovereigntyorput up 1 tower activate sov contesting module then go blow up all the other pos that have sov contesting modules if you dont defend your sov claiming tower then how could you deserve the systemto be clear all the other activities counting for influence  terrible idea
i agree completely hisec does not mean safesec between macrominers alts and people avoiding at any cost wardecs npc corps are being exploited everyone at some point should have to leave npc corps npc corps imho exist to provide a safe refuge for new players and possibly a safe refuge for those burnt out by lowsec 00 space  but should not exist as a permanent homesp levels can be avoided by just training up under the limit and stoppingtime in game would be much harder to avoid especially for macrominers  they make their money by mining all the time  take that away from them after 60 days move them their gear and whatnot to a wardecable npc corp i stayed in an npc corp for i think about 33 days many people stay much less some quite a bit more for various reasons rl wont let them log in whatever so 60 days game time i dont know but people existing wo risk of fighting is lame imhoganking and collecting insurance has always seemed illogical to me so tweaking that seems good to me taking out the ganks for lulz and replacing it with a more focused gank for  seems much more in line with the spirit of the gameakedit for spelling  posting after a 12 hour shift  failak

how is ganks for lulz not within the spirit of a society that is practically lawless and populated by immortals many of who have an excess of time and money on their handsgiven those conditions some people are going to go on rampages and kill others just because they can get away with it in any case i dont think the proposed changes will eliminate this kind of suicide ganking anyway but i wanted to point out that ganks for lulz is something that fits within the concept of eve
hell yes losing drones like that can be so annoying
one should not lose their drones because of a random disconnect not fair at all warping them out is not a good idea since the server cannot know whether client is disconnected on purpose or not exploit however it makes sense to not switch aggression to drones after their host has left grid with the exception of course that the drones were already aggressed
that would be awesome indeed and when he logs back in the drones will return as well but as rogue drones attacking their former master
supportedi would also support forcing the drones to return to the ship before warping or allowing us a configuration option to toggle off the warp on disconnect behavior
great idea losing an entire flight of drones through no fault of your own is frustratingwindjammer
this could be further enhanced by checking against the potential for the logoffski by simply having a calculation which checks a whether the pilot was fighting another person and b how much into structure the pilot was at the time the disconnect occurredif the pilot was fighting against another pilot vs fighting npcs and was deep into structure there would be a chance that they employed the logoffski and for this reason i would offer a chance that their drones would either successfully or unsuccessfully return to their dronebay or return under their control when they returned to the area in questionfor the latter obviously it would be better if they were still in the area for the reason that the other pilot would likely either scoop them or destroy them
returning drones to the pilots control see the bold font of your quote would be nice and a step in the right direction but i still like the ops idea better look at drones as a weapon when you emergency warp out due to client or computer crash you dont leave your guns or launchers behind why should your drones be different in this regardwindjammer
by the nature of the actual action of the drones theyre not physically attached to your ship some could argue that theyre tethered by the programming that controls them and that could be a viable rp aspect to why they might return but whateveri look at it this way  if im throwing baseballs at someone and decide to book it or im pulled off for some strange reason im not going to automatically find my baseballs ifwhen i returnibt drones  baseballs argument
you just win this forums
personally i feel that highsec miners like me need to have a safe place to conduct our business while warring factions take their aggression out on each other freely as long as they have an outlet for free pvp wherever they may want it at their choosing then highsec will be a much more equal place
i feel that removing insurance payouts increasing sec status hits and decreasing concord response time are steps in the right direction but more needs to be done and i think the op hit the nail right on the head
highsec is safer not safe
at least people arnt taking it seriously 
now that wardecs are officially griefing its very clear that consensual pvp is what ccp intends for hisec we might as well just see it done in one big patch rather than dragging the pain out over several

supported 100i would further ask that all mission deadspaces be locked from anyone but the mission runner and they would not be scannable by any probes and anyone salvaging from wrecks that are not created by them would get concordokkened
i was 10 seconds away from posting the exact same op
i support the ops idea to just get it over with
i support this as a short term milestone in a long term project i think we should be able to play an instanced eve that way we can setup duling games conquest games racing games and others it would be great to earn isk in our private instances and then compete in the other instances we enjoy trading could be down in a shopping instance where there is a worldwide market or maybe through a jita channel this would solve all the problems of griefers exploiters and large bully alliances controlling all of 00  ccp could then get really creative with new instance designs like eve universes that had different rules or extended epic missions
1 under this proposal there is no incentive not to blob now structures will die even faster cap ships online must be addressed to successfully alter tower combat mechanics just lower hp on structures will encourage blobs playing steamroller one of the factors stopping the steamroller right now outside the jammer is the time commitment until the solution is found tampering with that commitment will make larger problems nerf focused fire that is a dangerous door i would rather not open 1000 gunners at a tower unable to focus fire is not an advantage at all 2 there was a fuel cell idea floating around that could make tower upkeep less mind numbing keeping the cost up or some sort of economic impact is important what ever happened to that idea3 i see no mention of how the jammer is defended again moving these modules around is not a solution how does any of this encourage smaller gangs cannot support this proposal sorry
1 im afraid i couldnt disagree more while the comedy 25 hardener pos needs to go small gangs shouldnt be able to take space quickly going by the backstory behind alliances not being allowed to join up in factional warfare it seems that 00 empires are meant to be just that  as powerful as some of the npc corporations the time taken to take out a pos allows the defender time to rally a fleet and get online2 oh god yes my only concern is that this decreases the opportunity for causing diplomatic incidents by stealing stuff from an offline pos3 surely a simpler solution to the cyno jammer would be to either bump the system sovereignty requirement to 4 so only true region capitals get protection with a valid route to taking the system available take out outpost systems that are unjammed killing off sov 4 in the capital disabling the jammer keep the sov requirement at 3 but to bump the power  cpu requirements to cripple its control towers defenses or prohibit any pos modules other than the control tower and the jammer being anchored at that moonthis would solve the major problem of the pos wiping out fleets while they load the grid while not forcing any major changes in4 didnt jade say that he wasnt going to bring any 00 ideas forward because he cant get consensus and wah wah wah i want to be relevant in 00 warfare
small gangs wouldnt be able to take space unless the owner of the pos fell asleep or forgot about it or was too busy doing other things either way i didnt touch stront timers in the proposal you get the mails you show up and whoever is more strategically placed wins the day and there are very rarely any times when the defender actually shows up to defend the pos when its being attacked initially 90 of the fights occur when the tower is coming out of reinforced thats when its most important for organization the purpose of lowering hp on all posanchorablesstation services is to allow small gangs to initiate the combat to be able to dictate where combat for sov or installation disruption can occur this isnt allowing a small gang to dictate the outcome thats up for both parties to deciede by putting critical combat assets when the towers come out of reinforce some good ideas on the cyno jammer but its simply easier to move it away from the tower all together if the pos is there the shields are still on the defender side reducing lag on grid to just ships is the goal and thats why moving the jammer is the best option also keeping things simple for testing purposes almost makes moving the cyno jammer so blatantly obvious it goes without argument
for 1 would you leave dread damage alone

sorry the minutes are incorrect and you wasted your time they are open to minigames in ambulation im sure you could cook up something original interesting and not at all game breaking to propose there
understandably a lot of people are resisting any additions that look like entitlement to 00 we dont want to wow it up and give everyone a chancehowever all the action is happening on the same grids and this has been shown to be a problem for a number of reasonsmoves to break up sov conflicts and provide more potential for harassment techniques to impact a sovereign power to the point that they opt to cede unwanted territory would be desirable however they should in no way function to give everyone a piece of 00 as a participation ribbonwhere we can start this move is by providing more benefits to sovereign powers and more opportunities to fortify their space and ease its maintenance at the expense of more exposure to smaller gangs risk equals reward all action to rely on these systems is voluntarythe final goal is to break up the overall conflict of each individual pos to several grids with more direct attacks carrying more significance but where less direct attacks can prove disruptive if left uncheckedin short1 more defense afforded by outposts2 ferry drone system to ease pos to pos logistics 3 pos selfmaintenance and repair that has more granularity and exposure than the pos itself4 pos vulnerability across a more spread out system of objectives that will nominally incapacitate a pos that is experiencing repeated attacks on its infrastructure5 capability to restore a poss functionality across a more spread out area of objectivesto start i would like to see more stability for large alliances within their own territory wherever they have taken the time to put up some wallpaper and fix shingles on the roof the single best way to add more stability to the 00 occupants of sovereign space is to increase the defenses afforded by outposts such that dwellers can use them as a buffer between engaging every roaming vagabond and going out to meet the enemy this system should rely on the integrity of pos systems to deploy and maintain thus skirmish warfare can remove this capabilityto lower the maintenance requirements add a system of ferry drones that can move resources from starbase to starbase these drones would carry fuel from caches mined product to reactors and finished reaction products to final storage location all pos to pos traffic thus every pos in your system can be maintained from a central location if you maintain the routes for these drones and go hunt down lone invaders these ferry drones themselves should be able to be disrupted by attackers thus breaking down the automatic flow of logistics and increasing the amount of interaction required to pos structuresgive poss satellite structures that occupy another grid an array of systems that operate to lower fuel requirements supply added functionality to the pos and work to repair it imagine the energy sifter from predator a wounded pos collects aid from these satellite structures when the pos is at full capacity it has more grid and cpu available and has lower fuel requirementsthe array structures receive remote invulnerability from the pos via stront supplies that can be restocked via the ferry system attacks against this array will slowly drain the capability of a pos and eventually render it unable to function as a full deathstar other poss in the system will attempt to provide stocks to the pos that is under attack again via the ferry systemallow a defender who has successfully repelled the attackers and lowered the amount of roaming presence capability to redeploy more ferry drones and array structuresin this way pos warfare can be waged in smaller steps or all at once winning the slow war requires engaging small gangs and winning across multiple fronts skirmish by skirmish the system can be made vulnerable or continue to be reinforced by defenderssmall objectives tied to pos warfare that dont upset existing 00 powers there you have it
they are several very simple solutions that have been brought up and casually ignored by jade and co because they dont make life easier for themi honestly dont believe kelsin or jade has ever lived in 00 for an extended period of time if they are seriously suggesting that a small gang of people should be able to disrupt a sovereign alliancethere are so many inherent flaws with their proposal its mind boggling the goons and bob agree about it yet they continue to strut this idea like its perfectwe could compare soverign 00 alliances to npc factions they have gun emplacements on stargates to prevent small invasions if you want to allow a small gang to attempt to contest sov maybe there should be guns there that people could man to oppose them more effectively this change not only removes any defender advantage that should be gained it actually gives the attacker an advantage24 48 or 72 hours for sov and then back to neutral you intend for an alliance to have to patrol their entire space every 3 day to make sure not a single gate has been contested with no benefit of having to do such a task other than looking pretty on the map the benefits of 00 hardly out weigh the difficulty of holding it let alone justify putting more meaningless tasks for the players to performsome of the good suggestions would includesplitting up pos attacks to require multiple grids at once it doesnt reduce the blobs required to do it but at least changes them all having to be on the same grid at once to succeedmaking pos more like small outposts to allow smaller alliancescorporations the ability to establish a foothold the biggest issue for small corps is that they cant move out and set up base without using npc outposts or renting space the requirement for outposts is one of the biggest barriers of entry to 00 at this timemaking it worth smaller alliancescorporations time to even come out to 00 right now besides the lowest true sec systems and the rarest moons 00 has nothing to offer last i counted there were 24 10 systems in the whole game so maybe a few hundred that could produce money at the same rate as level 4 missions in high sec ignoring the safety issue moons are more often run by alliances than single players to help fund the alliance so you can hardly count those for individuals let alone the small alliance trying to start out high end asteroids are starting to move back up in the market but they are still a long way off the original base values obviously everything is more expensive but comparitevely ccp placed in the game
0018 00 sovereignty issuesccp has been discussing 00 and sovereignty internally for the past year and discussed many issues already they found that player owned station pos warfare is a very limited mechanic and that it revolves around the amount of dreadnoughts and other capital ships in the fleet while small ships only serve as support instead of being able to accomplish small objectives on their own the longterm plan for 00 warfare is to have multiple layers of goals and objectives instead of all fighting occurring over stations this would allow small groups to have an impact on the game instead of needing hundreds of ships to have influence in 00nathan ccp said that he does not believe that current largescale fleet combat is interesting for the participants mainly due to focus fireandrew csm jade constantine commented that current 00 pvp is siege warfare people stick to established fortresses and do not venture beyond the gates his suggestion was to include mechanics that encouraged sovereignty holders to patrol their space and have ways for roaming gangs to peck at undefended systems and steal resources therethe issue of logistics was also discussed alex stated that current pos logistics required an alliance to have powergamers that managed them around the clock he proposed to make 00 appeal to a wider audience by removing these repetitive activities that required powergaming shayne urged ccp to consider mechanics that would provide more synergy between the industrial and combat aspects of 00ccp said that they would have to balance short term achievements to the long term empire building if people could easily destroy in a day what took months to build up this would be unfair but on the other hand it should not be too hard to smoke out established entities they agreed however that the current time sinks in pos warfare are too longthis issue has been put on the rolling agenda and ccp asked the csm and the players to come up with concrete suggestions how to improve 00 warfare and sovereigntythats the minutes on the 00 sov topic if you had an issue with this you should have said something during the review sequence as it is we reviewed it ccp reviewed it it was officially signed off and it certainly reflects my memory of the discussion
well thats putting it in a rather crude and dramatic not to mention convenient analogy i was talking something more along the lines of a dozen or so wellcoordinated marines holding a choke point against a few hundred insurgents of course theyd get overrun but with timing and the advantage they might cause the enemy heavy losses and achieve some small goal anyway without too heavy losses themselvesbut if you dont want me to talk rl analogies even if you do yourself sure lets put it this way then its mostly empty space anyway a few planets and stations and asteroid belts are not alike a city few people are going to notice and its not going to upset the power balance in the region dramatically not until that gate becomes an important route of some kind because its basically all about the gate its the only object that has to remain constant unharmed and controlled throughout the entire situationlook it just seems more appropriate and proper rpwise that you can claim and hold a gate locking it down or taking control of its systems in some way at least thats not going to to keep a stronger foe from booting you from it or hacking it and sending a strike force through or from using a covert jump bridge to hop in and  you up the ass and then giving you the finger going fck off this is our territory
answered the first suggestion very handily in my previous postimplement pos satellite structures offgrid that can be repped or attacked to hinder or expedite the progress of reinforcingdestroying the tower this would allow attackers and defenders to keep forcing each other to move back and forth to locations simultaneously during the battle and make it so that one main blob cannot simply sit on the pos as effectively and a well coordinated mobile force can apply more forces where required with tradeoffs for splitting up that make it not the voluntary im divided conquer me action that it is nowlikely during a large battle part of the force would try to remain hidden and defeat would mean outmaneuvering the committed forces and forcing the other side to play their hand and give up any surprise advantageon the flipside taking advantage of an attacker could mean instead making swift attacks against their own infrastructure while they were mobilized with the goal of creating more disruption at home than could be caused against a single pos being dropped into reinforcedthese would be very healthy changes to sov warfare tempted to push the ideas in a separate thread if they are so counter to the op
how about instead of having a slapfight over what was said in minutes reading what i just posted i handed you a solution to these issues on a silver plattereasier logistics checksplit up objectives where smaller ships can play a role check
i am sure many 00 entities would support this so i highly recommend it
i sense funky resonance will continue to spread funky vibes and unconditional breakdancer prosperity to the eve universeproposals are in this postthreadjacking want to clean up the idea a bit and then open up a new thread maybe
go post it as an issue in its own right and lets get people debating it if it looks good to go after a decent discussion ill be happy to get it up on the agenda
full of win and awesomenessfrigate captain come on people we can beat the evil with love
as part of hijacking this thread in preparation for forking going to get some groundwork fleshed out1 ferry drone systemsimplifies starbase logistics and provides the lowest level goal for a roaming gangdrone sourcecostdrones are manufactured from materials available in any veldroid and quite cheap bpos are available at the scale of marshmallows in a box of lucky charms the value is in what they carry the cheapness is to signify that you attack them to disrupt things not inflict lasting wounds and to make sure that implementing them on a large scale is quite easy this should result in a large availability of lowhanging fruit to a roaming gang miners or not stay at home tactics cannot protect your logistics operationdrone vulnerabilitydrones are very convenient but also very vulnerable they warp from one pos to the next and come out of warp to a few clicks outside the bubble and my god are they slow in times of peace they are your friend to the pirates you ignore they are an income sourcedrone programmingdrone programming should be very easy as to not be worse than the problem the simplest thing i can come up with is to have simple scripts one for need and one for availability every time you launch a pos initiate a harvest or start a reactionrefine a script pair is generated for every materialfuel requiredproduced the pair are tied together and exist really as one item you can store a value in either the need or the demand script the value tells the drones to either maintain a certain level at one location or to ship a certain amount to another location when it becomes available to complete the drone route take the need or supply script to another pos structure where you want the material to gothe server looks at all pairs of scripts compares availabilityneed to search for compatible matches and dispatches drones to attempt to fill all shipping requirementsdrone usage instructionsto put fuel in all the poss in a system set the need scripts for those poss to the desired value and place the availability script into a hangar array where you will deposit fuel ship fuel to that pos when the drones detect a pos has less than it needs and that there is a registered supply where some is available they will move it from one to the nextto do moon mining and ship the materials to a single reactor program the availability script with the appropriate sized bite of moon material and place the need script in the destination poss desired module whenever a cycle is mined the drones will go to work moving it to the pos with the need scriptthe system could be made much smarter i dont think anyone would oppose this right down to balancing fuel levels smartly and working around cycletime differences for different modulesfun timeso you know your enemy is having a field day on a good moon and that theyre shipping the product to a hangar array at 115 pos you would go roam them but they like stayathome tactics and all you would normally do is scare the miners back to the station look at the paladindocking up safe and soundtime to go raidif they wont fight mess with their logistics and steal their moon loot since you know the route you can jump in on grid using the same route as the drone wait for the drones to make their run put up a bubble pop the drone as it comes out of warp 400km away from the pos scoop the refined productdrone after drone will continue trying to service the order each one dropping you more loot scoop to haulercarrier go homeat the very least you can make their pos fueling nightmare just like it is now one by one fuel bay by fuel bayevery bit of this system is voluntary it can make life a lot easier it comes with a price
2 pos modulation arrayoffgrid pos satellite structuresized arrays for sized poss four arrays per pos one at 12 oclock towards star 3 6 and 9 oclock each one is a few thousand km away from the control towercurrent pos needs to be cut down a bit statswise but able to be made even stronger than current through the addition of arrays the whole package will have many benefits to the holder but will come at the price of increased exposure to more mobile threatsroleplayer garbagethe pos modulation array creates a field between the control tower and the array which captures flux in the gravitational tide to create a powerful energy source the array also acts as a defensive structure by boosting the control tower shields remotely through the energy capture field interfacebenefitsyou want to have them because they vastly increase your defensive options as well as making it possible to field a much more resource friendly even fiercer death star that will take longer to go down you also want these because they will draw small gangs like a bugzapper for you to go pvp with in a nonboring fashion ddrawbacksyou want to attack them because theyre more accessible and will slowly bleed the pos if your smaller attacks are left uncheckedintimacy dto establish lots of goals for small gangs to harass the pos in a costly fashion that prepares for the final assault and makes lots of fun happenings around the pos there should be a complex relationship of small transactions between the pos and its arrayspos reinforcedto preserve the current relationship where timezones cant allow a 3am alarmclock raid to change sov when the pos goes into reinforced the arrays go into reinforced as well thus theres no new advantage to attacking a pos after its in reinforcedthe pos modulation array life cycleyou deploy the tower and deploy what you want it to support on its own pg you deploy the arrays they warp off and deploy and you set up what you want them to support on their supplemental power gridbecause the deathstar has about twice current powergrid assaulting it head on without touching the arrays would be a nightmare a few gunners would make fast work of dreads and the remote shield boosting would work completely to counter even a very large fleet the ammo and stront requirements alone would be huge the process of reinforcing poss will be much more challenging to large fleets if they insist on the old road to stront timersto create a system that would be really fun for ships of all sizes string out everyones forces over a large area and provide diminishing returns for both sides to blob ive come up with some preliminary ideasproposed super towerarray intercoursethe tower tries to heal arrays using repair drones which warp around and can be intercepted and shield bursts drawn from its own shield buffer indirect attacks on the arrays can thus be used to reinforce the towereach array diverts its power to creating a shield burst to add to the tower the bursts start off as little targetable blue dots that coalesce into a bigger ball that grows geometrically repping these bursts causes them to grow much faster they can be hunted down easily in the early stages by small shipsthe arrays will go into individual reinforced with a high shield recharge rate and capability to receive repairs this is simply to make it impractical to remove the arrays before the tower is gone can hold them down but cannot take them out entirely defenders of course encouraged to attack the weakest linkto give a tip for the attacker when it comes to diminishing returns attacking an array will cause the tower to start building up a shield burst regardless of how much damage you do after you trigger the repair a free 1m hp hit to the tower if you can shave a few hundred thousand off an array d
nan  can you clarify how your idea eases logistics is it just that these offgrid structures reduce the fueling requirements of the pos theyre linked to what substance are they ferry drones moving back and forth and where does it originateedit  oh whoops i saw it  so the drones allow you to have a single drop off point for your fuel in a system and they distribute it as needed to all pos in systemalso in theory i do like the idea of somehow raiding enemy pos however is that fair considering time zones whats to stop a us timezone force from constantly plundering an australian timezone pos when few or no members are online
the idea of the drones is to allow a higher level of noninvolvement in pos logistics if you can keep the roaming threats tamped down and hunt down black ops etc its completely voluntary so if youre under constant attack you just do pos logistics the old wayi imagine it as the perfect tradeoff if you do more pvp on your borders and in territory sweeps something fun you can have less pos fuelingresource moving to put up withid like to see them implemented such that anything that has to be ferried from one pos to another in normal operations can be relegated to the drones and leave sov powers to fight in combat ships instead of putting around in hauler rorqualseasing fuel requirementsas far as arrays lowering logistics requirements have them lower the fuel consumption imagine them asgiant wind turbines that power the pos in a green peace friendly method they also can divert their power to boosting the pos shield i havent come up with numbers yet because im not sure where to start balancingid like the numbers to be at levels where the eased normal fuel consumption is somewhat balanced against being able to be trickily reinforced by a smaller gang in normal ops it requires less fuel but if you use stay at home tactics a few unanswered bss will actually raise your fuel bill and eventually disrupt moon miningcombat operationsim thinking a lot on how to implement the sov warfare side of thisi havent really worked out the best system for the arrays when damaged not sure if the reinforcing model or the incapacitation model is better for purposes of ensuring the arrays stay in the fight for the final pos showdown functioning as fight decentralization mechanisms i like the reinforced model betterrough draft of array reinforcement modelwhenever an array is damaged below 25 shield it goes into a shieldrecharging reinforced this requires stront and the pos will attempt to recharge the shield more quickly using its own shield buffer while in reinfoced the array does not lend any power but instead diverts its energy to recharging its own shield thus an array that is left to heal itself will resume grinding the siege process to a haultany arrays that are online will begin charging up a shield repair burst to send to the pos imagine fireflies made of shield energy thats being corralled into a single ball it starts off as a series of smaller targets that float around at frigate speeds and then coalesce into a larger and larger target before attaining the appropriate size and being dispatched to the pos at a few kms the size should be sufficient to make it a capital f up to ignore the arrays as if fighting against a group of triaging carrierssince the bursts are targetable they are nice little sites of constant skirmish activity between enemy and friendly support during siegesince the arrays can be used to suck the life from the pos they are a smallgang target for combating stay at home tactics as well as a way to fight the pos warfare at the small gang level while keeping your full hand hidden in a safespot until the final tower attack is ready to begin or you choose to engage forces at a particular array much more room for feints and quick chargesprobably a lot of ways to do this but the implementation should be well thought out such that the arrays are part of the tower fight and cant be blobbed individually as stepping stones on the way to the tower they should be continuous sites of engagement and require movement from array to array to counter enemy actions at other arraysthe goal is limited commitments and slow escalations across several grids with the threat of being outmaneuvered when ones forces are totally committed too earlyabout ready to start work on an actual proposal
this is a reply to the idea of expanding sovereignty warfare to include objectives for small ships and small gangs this proposal is terriblei am not in favor of giving frigates cruisers and small gangs expanded roles in fleet operations frigates already play an essential role in large engagements tackling cruisers also have an essential role support meaning antitackler repair or antiantitackler small gangs even have a role even though they are not usually in a separate gang from the main fleet camping gates and stations while the main fleet attacks a possmall gangs also play an essential role outside of major fleet engagements by disrupting enemy logistics in fact this job is essential to achieving ultimate victory even if it doesnt get much gloryplease do not turn 00 sovereignty conflicts into capture the flag or shortduration take and hold contests i came to eve for the experience of being part of a vast intergalactic conflict between major political powers and thats exactly what i get with the current implementation of sovereignty warfare and major fleet engagements the finer details of the sovereignty warfare mechanics need tweaking but not to the extent of diminishing the scale of the conflicts
thank god you linked this to me i have no idea where to find the minutesthis is contrary to what was stated in some cases i dont expect your memory to be any less reflective of your obvious narcissistic disorder than anything else so im not surprised to hear you say thatit was pointed out in the meeting and not reflected in the minutes that small groups today already can have an influence in 00 and do whether you want to admit that because its inconvenient or not it was also pointed out that there will never be a way to prevent the guy with the most ships wins among other things i know because i contributed to that discussioni didnt have a problem with the minutes until someone decided to take the editorialized and abridged conversations we had and use them as a mandate to do something which wasnt requested whats your point
the rl analogy was used to illustrate how ridiculous yours was it wasnt meant to be taken literallyif you want to control gates go do it the codes already in the game
its pretty clearly requestedits also clearly stated that ccp wants objectives for small ships on their own as opposed to simply support rolesit really doesnt get much more cut and dry than that if ccp didnt include your comments in the minutes it may be because they dont agree with you
how about you stick to what you know i was there you werent did they want to explore other methods sure so do i was it explicitly stated that sov warfare should change in any one particular direction no a high level idea was floated in the 20 minutes we were allowed for the topic of fostering a bit more variety it was never stated that an additional mechanic was required which would allow 10 people to challenge the sov of thousands everyou put together a proposal that is creative nothing wrong with that i dont like the proposal and find it unworkable but that shouldnt take away from the work youve done that took effort and thats a good thingedit we dont need to go crazy trying to assume as law the editorialized and abridged version of a greatly abridged discussion on a very large topic that would be stupid
here is where i link the concepts i am talking about specific simple changes to sov mechanicsthe purpose is not to allow small groups to control the tempo or politics of 00 and this isnt about allowing people the right to exist in 00 this is about allowing small gangs to impact 00 the huge hp in posanchorablesstation serivces require long times large numbers of caps or extremely large numbers of pilots to carry out in reasonable times those three senarios bring with it unplayable lag the situation devolves into huge blob is needed to put a system into contension the only response is to bring an even huger blob and thus the huger blob succeeds because the lagdesynch not necessarily because of tacticsif smaller gangs can contest sov disrupt money making operations and hit installations affecting life in 00 alliances would need to seriously think about where they put their resources and who they can afford to help buisness in empire opens up as mercenaries can strike 00 alliance installations mega alliances stay home and cant help each other by bringing everyone they have to 1 system as a number of installations and or systems resources are in contention and the whole structure of 00 is aligned to the ones who can help themselves and strategically align with partners who are capable not by getting the most people but by building the best coalition thats what the goal should be this is what 00 should be from a political and combat standpoint and nobodies specific birthright
small gangs already impact 00 a wellorganized and determined gang of tech 1 and 2 frigates destroyers and cruisers can cripple an alliances general population the pilots trying to make money by living producing ratting and exploring in the alliances space in fact by impeding the memberlevel incomegenerating operations of an alliance these small roaming gangs make a valuable and necessary contribution to a sovereignty conflict with that allianceit makes sense that putting a solar system in contention requires a large fleet and major logistics operations solar systems arent small although they are the smallest unit of sovereign territory in this game and they should require a major fleet of capitals battleships and support to controlthe issue here shouldnt be how can we can make this game have a less grand scale but what can be done to get the technology ie the software and hardware to support properly ccps vision of a grand scale space conflict
killing ratters and periodically camping gates to look for targets by random gangs does not affect 00 politicssov and has very little impact as people will just wait till the threat is ceased and then continue concerted and deliberate attempts to affect or disrupt those assets valuable to 00 alliances can only be done by hitting station serivces and pos installations there is no way what your saying is true for member level its the station services if they cant med clone refine fit members have a serious problem at the alliance level its the towers used to control sov act as safe points for members act as resource gathering etc so i do not aggree with what you are saying here one bit you are clearly missing the point and i dont know how else to explain this to you the only time the system or installation is in contension is when it comes out of reinforced i am clearly making the destinction between the initial attack and the actually fight for the installation as 2 separate events the way small gangs can take part in 00 combat is to address the selection and initiation of an attack on 00 installationstation services fleets are then used to destroycontrol the installationsov thus the members wishing to finish off or control sov would need sufficient resources the grand scale sucks it doesnt work there is no grand scale at 1 frame per second and for the majority of pilots in 00 who complain on a daily basis that the lag is killing their play clearly somethign with the mechancis needs to be done you dont wait around for the technology to catch up to finally compliment current mechanics the current mechanics werent useful when they were deployed the whole purpose of the station serivces and moving the anchorables outside shields was so that small gangs could engage these targets but at the last second ccp balked and gave them ridiculous hp to make it not worth the while or realistically for large fleetscaps thats what needs to be addressed as a primary concern and as a secondary concern the ability of alliances to gang together for the simple goal of defeating lagdesynch by simply inducing it andor achieving a larger percentage of players actually participating on grid so sorry nobody here wants to sit and wait for the technology to catch up and if it did it still wouldnt completely address the lack of interest small gang pvp has with regards to alliance matters in 00 i dont dissaggree that small gangs shouldnt be able to destroy installations and command sov what i am saying is that small gangs could have the role of initiator in 00 being able to dictate points of contension and provide a real impact not just ganking ratters who are falling asleep or afk
tell that to the alliances pl camped into their stations until goons showed up to take sov some of those alliances were practically into a failure cascade freefall before we even started shooting posesi guess i am missing the point because i still dont see why frigates and cruisers need more roles than they already have either the small ships are in a large fleet playing their roles in a large fleet engagement tackling antitackling or repairing or theyre in a small gang running around somewhere doing something essential to the overall conflict or even just roaming about and having funasked and answered there will never be a better alternative than bringing more ships to the battle than your opponent given this fact ccp should be focused on working on their code and beefing up their hardware not scrapping a system for which 85 of the work is already done
why are you confusing small fleet with small ships the diversion is not necessary nobody said anything about frigates and cruisers you are confused big time again you are bringing up things that have nothing to do with revamping 00 for the sake of providing gameplay back to where it should be there are other proposals with less changes in fact all i offer to change is simply reduce hp on station servicespospos anchorables and move the cyno jamm away from the pos pretty simple nobody would be scrapping anything again your not even addressing the issue here just spouting off stuff
ok you bring your small fleet to shoot at my pos which is all thats necessary now that youve lowered structure hps but i bring my slightly larger fleet to prevent you from destroying my pos you realizing that ive brought more ships and can destroy your fleet before you can destroy my pos get more ships into your fleet obviously im going to do the same next thing you know the node is crashing gee your changes really solved that problemits not the hit points of structures the amount of fuel in the towers or the position of a cynojammer that are the problems here changing those things does nothing to change the facts that you will still need more ships than me in order to win and that we will both keep bringing ships until we exhaust our available resources or the node crashesfix the network infrastructure and everything else falls into lineedit but we can discuss the merits of your proposal in your own thread i initially posted here to counter the ops ideas about involving small ships and small gangs in contesting sov by turning sovereignty into a shortduration minigame of capture the flag or take and hold i responded to your post simply to point out that i think this idea being bandied about that small gangs need to be more involved in contesting sov is a red herring there are already useful and interesting roles for small gangs in a larger sovereignty conflict
you are so way off base i am surprised you even said that knowing tri and the tactics like pl bob goons and the like employ are you that unaware its not about the poss or anything elsethe biggest thing you do is to hit there real infrastructure the pilots you stop them from mining running supplies and making money you have effectively taken away the means to keep there poss running and building more materials without the support of the pilots all this crap about poss are meaningless after they been hit by these gangs enough all the bears go to empire and then after that the morale drops in the crapper and then failcascade if it was not effective no one including tri would never ever had used it or create depts just for this most of the gangs roaming 00 are not lark gangs some are but most are not they are there for a purpose and they are very successful this attitude does not surprise me however from someone from tri yea a little most players would not know what these gangs were if they came up and bit them in the ass even then they are not aware they just  about nanocloacking gots
this is definitely the debate that needs to be had to me the heart of the question was always does territory control have to be focused only on poswhile there are certainly plenty of ways to improve pos warfare i believe ccps goal is not to simply put more variety into pos warfare but to expand territory warfare to be more than just about pos and that means that some of the hard benefits that come from owning space fuel efficiency bonuses the ability to anchor certain territoryshaping structures etc must be derived from objectives achieved by different activities than just constructing and sieging posthats the context i wanted to have the discussion of this proposal in but i think theres a lot of disagreement about whether that context is even desirable in the first place so its good that its being brought up nowto me territoryshaping abilities that are governed by smallgang objectives or noncapship objectives can exist alongside territoryshaping abilities governed by pos warfare i think it makes sense for pos to govern industrial benefits and for a system like tactical arrays to govern individual system protectiontype abilities like cynojammers and system scanners a smallgang objective system like capturing stargates would be useful alongside those other two to reflect broad inspace military presence across whole constellationsnow at this point some people say well why dont we just fix pos warfare and thats where i agree with the ccp statement that pos warfare is inherently too limiting in terms of its need for dreads and large numbers of capships to be a truly comprehensive territory control system it would work fine as one part of a territory control system but its unwieldy when it tries to be the whole thingobviously the current 00 powers are good at pos warfare and know a lot about it but that doesnt mean that it is the best system all by itself for territory control figuring out the best territory control system based on the direction ccp has said they wish to go is going to involve thinking beyond the current system it will certainly benefit from the input of those engaging in pos warfare but we need i think to acknowledge that the goal is to create something bigger and greater than just pos warfare as opposed to simply improving it and direct our thinking and debate with that in mind
since we are discussing tactics about my proposal this simple fact of bringing moar ships at least has the prospect of being negated multiple systems can be hit at short time large fleets take time to mobilize and move and are easily engaged while enroute but are extremely difficult to engage when amassed at a lagged out tower and your simple thesis that small gangs already have plenty to do with sov in 00 is about as misguided and ludicrious further noteworthy coming from a person in a 5000 man alliance as for the impact of terrorizing a sov holders entire region killing rattersdestroying disrupting logistic chains that doesnt sound like small gang combat in fact its the exact opposite it sounds moar like moving 1 alliance into the doorstep of another completely different senarios and therefore your analysis is fail
obviously i dont agree of the two of us youre the one who proved himself to be full of it youve kicked your credibility to the curb while attempting to discredit me my credibility remains intactwhat youre doing right now bears a strong resemblance to a guy back pedaling madly while cupping both hands over his family jewels in an effort to minimize the incoming damage you might consider manning up and apologizing rather than trying to drag me with you into your self made mud puddlewindjammer
its not really a question of credibility its just about whether the op is too vague to support which it remains it really needs to be cleaned up to clearly state what it is recommending to ccp
im not happy this thread has devolved into a personal credibility fight either it happens sometimes in these threadssome of your suggestions are interesting and im sure youd get commentary if you started a thread in assembly hall using your ideas as a proposal alternately or in addition to doing that you might want to post them in ships and modules for discussionwindjammer
i dont blame you for not reading the whole thread its gone off track on these last couple pages the credibility issue is the result of elanmorin6 trying to discredit me in an attempt to stop me from postingyour assertion regarding the op is bang on and is the main point of most of my posts in this threadwindjammer
well i support this thread simply because i want the issue further discussed here my viewscarriers are the new bs who claims otherwise doesnt really fly them i suppose i myself are a fully skilled carrier pilot means all dronessupport moduleseverything on at least lvl4 so i spent my fair share of skilltime for it and im part of this silent majority he speaks off i rarly post on forumsi participated in 00 warefare since back in 04 its not my only character and experienced all from bs blobs to titan warefare live and in contact with the fcs organizing the fleets for themthe moment i finally knew that carriersmoms where overpowered was when i saw them in action by groups like mc who really mastered this kind of warefare and with a 100man capblob cleaned out the north in about 1 month i had my carriercharacter this one and my bscharacter and the bschar was useless against the capblob really frustratingafter that we finally got the titan nerf and a part of the carriermom nerf we got the cynojammers to make bs needed again its still not enough in my books make carriers different that has to be on ccps agendai for sure dont want the carrier beeing nerfed to death i simply spent too much time skilling for it but i dont want it to be a replacement for my bs either this spring i found myself only flying caps every day to make 00 logistics to fight to support my corpalliance the carrier could do just everything and better then everything else well i trained for a rorqual too after the cargonerf my carrierchar made my real pvpchar obsolete apart from small gangwarefare and it was not rare that when defending even a small gang cynoed in a carriermomlong story short go for it and discuss it with ccp they will find solutions but tell them the issue is still there
yes a post every other day on the same topic is clearly spam youve pinpointed it the very definition of spam now begone apeface
if every single complete carebear left the game tomorrow the game would go an as before and probably be a lot betterif every single pvper left the game tomorrow the carebears that are left playing would soon see the game become extremely boringif you think about it im sure you can understand why
if either care bears or pirates left tomorrow then ccp would lose a huge profitand they certainly dont want thatthats why pvp and pve content will remain in play otherwise theyll lose playerbase and the almighty dollar or whatever currency you use
i think you missed the point somewhatthe important part is that you have to penalise the players in the starter corps to encourage them to leave and join either new npc corps or player corpsrestrictions similar to trial accounts should apply to starter corps
i fully support thisin fact i would like to get some answers to the following questionswhat is ccps vision of eve for the next 18 monthswhy does ccp want people to move to 00 when the only incentive is pvp ccps oftstated desire is to get people out to 00 and the game has been around a few years by now what exactly is the holdup why is ccp dealing with suicide ganking in such a cackhanded manneris eve being used as a testbed for ideas to be incorporated into their world of darkness mmo if so why is harsh universe in space being used to testbed ideas for a 14yearold emo kids with silly hair emmowhy is ccp dealing with problems that the csm presented from the middle  at best  of the prioritised list what happened to yknow the more important stuffhow hard is it to write a statement of purpose anyway
man its been a crappy day and i needed a good laughthe ops post fit the bill nicelyyou actually think you are going to get a statement of accountability from a company like ccp yeah and you can jet to other planets on moonbeams too seriously though it sounds like the op and many of the other people in this thread have been buying a little too much into the democratic illusion ccp has spun with the creation of the csmthe csm though democratically created have no power the only thing they can do more than us in the forums is get a few developers that choose to show up at the meetings facetoface and ask them questions andor make suggestions thats it nothing elsewake up people we as players live in a capitalistic driven totalitarian dictatorship that is the cold reality you can demand accountability from ccp until your blue the face you wont get itbut what the hell ill give you a support for having the deluded moxy to ask for it in the first place
always good reasoning the thing is just that even pvping solo is interacting with peopleso in part all this swarming and blobbing can be blamed on people finding soloing or smallganging way too unprofitable
waah waah
ill admit the dev blog seems like serious overkill for the issue but the idea of addressing it is in eves general natureat the risk of repeating the rather bs eve is a cold dark place i think people tend to forget is its supposed to be cold and dark all around not just for targets eves mechanics tend to heavily favor the attacker all around and sometimes this needs to be rebalanced a bit esp as attack ships have been getting cheaper and more powerful while defenders esp industrial ships have been pretty much unchanged for quite some timesounds like what they want to do is slap the gankbares down a bit while still leaving the fundamental mechanism in place so the careless carebares can still get ganked if the target is worth whilewill the proposed changes do this eh hard to say i kinda doubt it though is the push behind them against eves history no not really pirates want easy targets any rational attacker will non pvp players want easy counter and escape right now the mechanic is heavily in the favor of the pvp player and even with these changes it will still be heavily in their favor mission ships will be harder to take down but really they were being popped with way too much ease in the first place due to the problems of pve being so differnt then pvpcarebares are not getting as much out of this change as people think this isnt even parity
i would like clarification too this is old ccp devs attitude
ive done both repeatedly while on my own and so far i havent lost a bs in lowsec you just need to have a clue and a scout tbh by scout i dont mean an alt either  i mean either a friend or just a covops ship in station which you can use to check for camps before jumping as for undocking not many people can kill you inside the 30 seconds it takes to redock in a properly tanked bs
id not mind clarification but overall im seeing a lot of classic whining when particular changes affect particular people the op is particularly overthetop in classic forum style thrashing around as if the world is coming to an endafter these changes eve will still be a pvp game it will still be as much of a sandbox as it was a year ago you do know what a sandbox means right that is nonlinear with no endgame lets you do whatever you want and given the current subscriber rate id say we can still call it a niche gamewhat precisely has changed the nano changes change pvp i dont think you can argue it changes it to nonpvp the suiciding changes only affect people in highsec anyway and if youre any kind of proper pirate youll already be at 10 that was nay is the goal of many a jollyroger and a mark of someone to take seriouslyin fact if youd read the blog the penalty for fighting in lowsec is lowering how is this a nerf for gods sakeso seriously whats changing what is the big deal what pray tell is causing the world to come crashing down and carealot stars to explode in nullsec so far ive missed this major change from eve to hello kittypirates have always had challenges they get barred from highsec they get sentry gun fire they get neutrals able to attack them without gaining gcc im talking worst case here  ccp clearly never intended piracy to be easy youre still here after all those changes which were in long before i even joined the game and yet this pretty minor suicide change suddenly has you throwing your toys out the pram bizarre
what would the real 10 pirates care you havent got a clueimmunity  a pvp free zone in ihighsec unless you sign up for pvp in trhe faction ware go go pvp flag on butan
i highly doubt ccp will even respond its rather obvious they dont really care at all
i share ops opinion would be nice to know where this is all going
agree with op
id like to paint you a picture there is a game it has changes and the maker of this game has requests for theirs reasons or demands for reconsideration all the time do they a respond to a 3 page thread on the forumsorb respond via devblog like they shouldas for the direction of the game id like to point out several things as a 00 ratter on one account and an carebear on this one i like pvp due to carebearness i can afford to have a 10 stack of abaddons in tash just take them out whenever to the wide open spaces of the world theres a whole lot of gate camps and blobs infact ive never lost an abaddon to less then 5 people ganging up on me ever so i fully support some mixing of the pot which is what ccp really seems to be doing oh and as a side note if you ever watch a devblog or a fanfest video the devs are probably the guys in nanos and gankboats roaming around lowsec laughing at the tears of their victims so i doubt theyre carebears
thats all we ask for exactly the point of this thread glad you identified it oh waiyou ever saw ccp fear or ccp noxchcggsd or whatever his name is at the fan fest ganking carebears i havent before oveur would give us a dev blog full of adapt of die n00b where it was clear that ccps vision still was a game that was harsh and unforgiving for lazy people recently oveur has been replaced by noname devs with no past record who suddenly speak of war decs being akin to griefing and people having no way to avoid suicide ganks times have changed the devs have changed has the vision changed thats what were asking here
wow you guys are really going to freak out when they make lowsec safer than no sec
those who have read my posts over the last 2 years will know that i have always been ready to give ccp the benefit of the doubt i have always argued against hysterical abuse been strongly supportive of the devs right to guide the game according to their vision been nothing but orthodox in my advocacy of personal responsibility consequences for actions risk vs reward i loved what eve stood for and defended that dogma passionatelycall me a fanboy if you will i played the game loved it spread the word got many friends to subscribe started additional accounts enjoyed winning survived losing helped new players ganked old players pirated fought wars mined missioned ratted rose from the depths of pvp ineptness to the dizzy heights of pvp mediocrity made plans for the long term  loved the possibility of making meaningful plans for a meaningful long term by any meaningful measure i have contributed a lot to this gamewithout false pride i say that i and those like me do deserve at least a clear honest statement of where this game is going and what the devs vision of the next couple of years is
regardless of differing opinions balancing and how one feels about any particular direction i utterly agree with this statementeve is a long investment game the ccp pr machine if not devs then at least some offical rep should be involved in these kind of questions a game like this lives or dies based off player retention and uncertainty is never good for such things 9 time out of 10 even if people dont like the answer they get it is still a better situation then no answer or some vauge nonanswerfor referenc i work at a game company and have found time and time again that giving customers honest bad news about the dirrection things are going always goes over far better then keeping them in the dark even if the end changes are what they wanted in the first place
on a side note since i just realized this do we really want corporate sponsorship in eve for events i mean who wants to be watching the next alliance tourne and see the cocacola titan warp in and go disco hmmmm
im not sure why you raise the topic but im all for it if branding the inside of every station with cocacola logos meant they got to build a server that can actually handle the player base ill go buy a case of the stuff right now
what he said i am used to ignoring advertising in real life i am capable of doing it in game as well
theres so many reasons this wont fly that im only going to bother bringing up onehow do you think this will affect the isk price of gtcs imagine there being a new player in eve with really deep pockets and he is hungry for gtcs really hungry with billions of isktheres a limited market of gtc sellerscan you spell gtc isk price inflation imagine a rocket on its way out of the atmospherenow imagine all the lost players that could only play cause they manage to gather up 400m isk every two months
ill agree with that somewhat though i think it could be counteracted by ccp making it known to new players that theres a eulalegal way to buy isk which would probably increase the supply pretty dramatically that said i dont see what other problems there would be dont assume its obvious  if you have reasons share them
i think that it is a bit of a slippery slope logical fallacy how many gtc do you think this would buy a month and after initial launch how much will the amount donated in isk begin to decrease thus binging down the number of gtc for charity even morebut if it is all that great a concern then a cap would simply have to be put in place to limit an artificial change of the open market price of gtc something im sure ccp would insist on any way if it was enacted
donating isk ingame  donating realworld currencyprobably one of the most creative ideas ever to come out of an mmorpgyouve got my support
and its a good opinion actually certainly considering that as a covert vessel and using tracking disruptors you can argue that the pilgrim shouldnt have too much of a signature in the first placehowever the fact that its hp is a little on the low side compared to the other recons as is and that it has such limited range because it should have higher firepower whats the point of a sneak attacker if theres no punch to the attack not everyone should have to resort to hacs and battlecruisers or clumps of frigates to take down those same ships and support vessels because you simply might not have the time or opportunity and since hacs seem to be losing even more ability to fight with the speed patch it would be good to have some alternativestealth bombers arent the uboat glass cannon attackers in this game really because they cant warp unseen force recons are and should have some attack power for this purposethen again that they dont have too much of a chance as is can also be blamed somewhat on local channel
pilgrim is a difficult ship to fix without completely redesigning it unfortunately while a range bonus on the nosneuts would certainly put it inline with the other recons make it a bit more flexible and go a long way toward directly and indirectly solving the worst of its problems im against radical nerfsbuffs of any kind in this game and to give it the range bonus would also require taking something away to keep it balancedand the pilgrim doesnt have much it can afford to give its drone bonus and nos amount bonus are perhaps too high a price to paygiven its inherent flaws ie short range limited usefulness of its ew and capgrid issues which all tie into each other in one way or another though i believe the pilgrim can be given some buff without taking anything from it and the subtle approach with a few percent here and there is always the best way to change things more cap and grid to improve its tank and ability to use its bonused high slot systems are commonly expressed ideas which would certainly improve the ship and are not over the top as would the sig radiusdrone durability idea i think these types of ideas are the ones we should be supporting and which would have the most chance of being implementedccp acknowledge the problems with the pilgrim its suffered a lot of damage because of your wild sledghammer nerfs in the past and this ship never deserved any of them
ill summarize this at oncesuggestion1 make all force recon ships closerange leave the longrange highpower ecm role to combat recon make the ships distinct and give each class a purpose2 give all recon ships one more slot3 increase the firepower of all force recon ships significantly carefully buff their stats appropriately and fit them into specific roles4 allow covert jump bridges to ignore cynosural jammersreasoningmany people have been bemoaning the tiness of the pilgrim in text and voice both while ive been present and whether if through subsequent analysis of the ships gameplay and stats itself or just sheer bandwagonism ive slowly begun joining this crowd of irates of the caribbean mostly because i think that ships that cloak are curious fun and a lovely variation away from the all the other mwd or die combat concepts actually you can somewhat ignore that last part because its not true but i wish it wereanyway further investigation better put as an inability not to be enlightened or at least informed by the amount of verbose crankiness going around has gradually led me to a somewhat more different conclusion than i thought that id end up with from the start this is the part where i take cover behind a large screen and light a smoke while waiting for people to get over their imminent outrageits not the pilgrim that needs a boosting kick in the arse the whole force recon class is redundant and should either be done away with or taken somewhere else entirelyyou can stop grinding your teeth nowwhat led me to this conclusion then well it was the lack of range and a very useful ecm and the closerange sneakattack playstyle that all pilgrim pilots are forced to utilize it seems to me that every other ship in the recon class possesses some sort of range capabilities only that the force recons forego the ability to actually take out their enemy for a cloak instead but why with such things as local channel powerful tanks that are unbreakable to them among their very target ships ships able to easily outrun them mwds limitations on ecm a pointed vulnerability toward missile ships a lack of tank on their own slow speed the lack of usage of covert jump bridges and many more other factors why the hell would anyone choose to fly a force recon besides the ability to maybe disappear and the cool visual of cloakingthere is no reasonmy suggestion has one line of reasoning force recon ships are bastard children an inconsistent class without much of a purpose either ccp should redesign things and let the combat recons fill the intended role of the strong direct ecm support and turn the force recons into the natural deepstrike ships that they seem to have been thought of as from the beginning a consistent and understandable advancement from stealth bombers high on firepower closerange only and using their ecm more than their tank to avoid retaliation a technical ship made to cater to a more distinct playstyle that i know quite a few people want to enjoy in eveor they can just skip them entirely
arent force recons the sneaky kind and combat recons the combat type
no use in sneaking up on someone if all its going to amount to is either costing you ammo or costing your shipyes of course they are excellent for sneaking up on people and holding them in place while you call in bsbc fire support but holding them in place doesnt always work and you dont always have that optionand force recons are still the most solooriented ships in the game this should be for a reason
so you want to give them more power i dont think i grasp what youre trying to explain
solooriented does not mean soloviable not in face of a whole lot of ships out there a whole lot in particular sacrileges drakes myrmidons caracals huginns cyclones all the damn interceptors cerberi ishtars ravensmostly im just hoping to give things a bit of distinction and a role
i support this idea  however some might look at force recons as one thing  cloaked cynoers for black ops hence the cyno gen bonus however i dont know anyone who runs black ops due to them being currently useless and i doubt anyone wants to use a 80m isk ship as a cyno ship i see it as a jack of all trades master of none class  it can cloak it can selectively in some types jam it can cyno cheaper it can be nanoed it can be used in a fleet or small gangs it can be used solo it can be used to grief its a tackler its a recon its used for black opsetcetcthe list goes onthe ships need looking at black ops is useless and so that makes the primary role of these ships useless these ships need reviewing and altering either make them have a stronger tank so if cynoing and found they can withstand a little bit before dying or allowing the ship to be the only ship to drop a cyno and then be able to still operate warp away cloak stick around to provide support etc or remove the cyno bonus and give us a a bonus based on the ship typethese ships needs to be made a master one of trade reconnaissance the ability to get behind enemy lines gather information and get back safely dispatching any small ships that could relay information back before they can its not meant to roam belts and dispatch ratters or tackle huge gangs of ships solo althoughthat would be nice ffs ccp at least some help with them would be nice or can i change all my skill points from them onto something else
well i think that a ship that is supposed to get behind enemy lines and break things really ought to be higher on firepower but your idea of them isnt far from excellent either id like to reiterate some words seen before thoughi cant say that i agree completely with this but its another alternative still i would much rather have a solopowerful assault ship but not as resilient as the assault cruisers one where you have to walk a knifes edge try and attack single ships hold on to your balls and hope that your target doesnt know how to fight you or has support coming in a natural continuation of the stealth bomber
yeah that shocked me as well
yes for a little bit then people will smarten up and not jump expensive missionships into lowsec without scouting so wait the lowsec00 corps are all going to band together  no most of the market transactions and such would still go on in hisec do you honestly think that the miners in lowsec00 are going to want to restrict themselves from that  no its in their best interests to get the minerals into hisec to market what makes you think every corp in lowsec00 is a pirate corp some corps will camp the gates for all the tasty lewtsothers will try to break evade via jump freighters or brs or otherwise circumvent the camps an eve with constant fights between pirates and nonpirates over essential paths into hisec space is like a wet dream
for sure but then what if they cant afford another ship do they grid lower level missions till they can afford another ship or just quiti dont think they will band together tbh i expect them to fight more since more isk will flow in lowsec and 00 then ever before so its cheaper for them to do sowet dream it is i agree with you on that part but jf and brs cant supply the empire market  even 50 of its current use at a guess that would mean that 00 and lowsec corps and alliances would need to mine the same ammout as current empire player base and get it to empire as well as pew pew the hell out of each other  that isnt going to ever happenprices will rise and a lot of empire corps will find themselves unable to build ships due to lack of isk to buy what they need to do it since they cant get it as freely or if they mine it for free expect time as beforemy corp works out of lowsec i know how to get round camps but i remember what it was like to mine and build bs in empire im not saying nothing needs to be done or even empire dont need looking at it does this is just to muchi jsut hope i have the quotes in the right place lol
how do jump freighers instantly solve any problem raisedthey can only jump so far before they run into a bottleneck gate that is a gate that leads into high sec where their cyno cant get ahead and lead them intoso the huge alliances you know the ones that love overpowering the competition by bringing a dozen titans to a fight start camping those few bottlenecks then you bring a large fleet to try and disperse them long enough to sneak some ore and minerals throughonly now the freighter pilots cant get anywhere because of webbers scramblers and the rediculous lag from having so many people in one placesure they might make it through this time but what about the constant supply of materials that any empire players would need to manufacture itemsthis idea started out looking like lets make high sec only for total noobs everyone else must go low secbut its rapidly been shown to be only those folks whove has the path 5 years to get control of low sec will have any authority kneel before their might
people have randomly and stupidly suicided their  before it has happened before and it keeps happening and it will happen in the future just because there might be a few people who think lol oh  i can make money in lowsec lets jump my expensive missionraven in there for a quick peek oshi gatecamp is no reason to stall positive change in the game i dont think what youre saying will happen but just to be sure you could add asteroids that give small quantities of lowsec00 ores to hisecso its possible to build  in hisec without stuff from lowsec00as long as the yield was small in comparison to the lowsec00 ores it would be goodwhy would huge alliances camp hiseclowsec gates what possible benefit would it be to them besides even if alliances did do that for some reason even though theyve never done it before then they would still bring their own minerals into empire regardless as i said above you could just allow smallyield asteroids that give zydrinemegacytenocxetc in hisec
supported because of two thingslowers hisec rewards making low and 00 relatively more profitableslows the general trend of isk inflation by clamping a major isk faucet
no it isnt but change like this on such a massive scale isnt positive change its tipping the ballance scales completly over to lowsec and 00 empire ore should be looked at empire should run dry so to speak unless supported by lowsec and 00 not dependent on it
this is what i was thinking as well why this desire to force players into lowsec if they dont want to go there why force players into pvp if they dont want to pvp if they can help itwhy should i care what makes pirates happymost definitely not supportedab
far from it in my entire time in eve ive engaged another person in unconsensual pvp only onceand i lost im just now getting my pvp chops and my winloss ratio has yet to be in the black im a fw pilot but before that i was pretty much a hisec mission runner myselfim suggesting this for several reasons really first the pvp community particularly the lowsec pirate community has taken several jabs recently and i think its time to throw them a bonesecond is that i realized just how easy i had it when i was mission runninghow much income i was making without any appreciable expensesnow that i have to afford a fw habit call it perspectiveand let me go ahead and address exactly why i a person who is decidedly antipirate shouldill tell you why i played uo almost from launch loved loved loved that game but hated getting ganked and robbed i played for months with a victim mentality getting more and more ed every time i got pkd i was the perfect spokesperson for the feluciatrammel split a major patch that split every server into two shards one pvp and one pve but before the split took effect my eyes were opened by a guild calling itself the skara brae rangersthese cats took me in and taught me how to engage the pks on my terms they taught me how to equip how to fight and basically removed the flightpanic reflex that had caused me to suck in buckets at pvp in the past i dies they died and we laughed about itand that took away my perfectionist shame at losing a fight it was probably one of the best times i ever had onlinewhen the tramfel split did finally go through i still thought it wouldnt be such a bad thingalthough i really didnt know which shard id end up living on well as it turned out the answer was neitherthe split created one shard that was great because of the abundance of creative and friendly folks and unplayable because of the total lack of excitement imagine thatthe threat of getting jumped was exciting after all it created another that was great because it was dangerous and difficult and totally unplayable because it degenerated into mindless  talking teabagging and general asshattery without any shred of soulive seen this elsewhere as well planetside could have been great if it had some of those more gentle souls that give mmos all their flavor swg could have been great if the pvp community hadnt been left unsupported and virtually stillborn for years i could go on but i think it can be summed up as the yin yang of this genreno pvp community and a game has no heart no carebear community and a game has no soul true greatness is only achieved when both exist in equal measure and particularly when both are allowed to comingle with each otherright now we have two separate communities that live on opposite sides of the 0504 wall i really think that needs to change for the good of the game
wouldnt work would be a marketing nightmarewhat your plan would do is pretty much close the game to any new playership prices would triple in no time possibly moremarkets would run dry would take a while on some thingsin essence its a bad plan
worst idea since nge
a better idea would be to have ccp randomly ban 1312 of their paying subscribersthat would surely get things rolling
after the general rabble over people suiciding ships and not getting insurance for them and how this is unrealistic i feel we should embrace this newfound want for a more realistic approach towards insurance in the world of eveonlinethe main factor in a differential between insurance cover in eve and that of the average 21st century noddingdogtype insurance company is of course risk assessment personally i fly a lot of cloaked ships and generally watch intel channels and i am pretty careful when it comes to flying ships i also fly a scimitar which makes me a doctor one of the lowest insurance categories and i am a very careful pilot with a pretty low claims amount which should make my premiums a lower amountthe other thing is the lack of products with only one product being released in the last 5 years and might i add a monopoly of the market which is not that good for inspiring growth in the market i am unable to get basic fire and theft cover saying that i do believe that fire cover is covered because a megathron of mine was spurting out mega flames this time but one time a ship of mine got jacked from a pos man i was only gone 5 minutes and the lack of a place for keys in my capsule left me in quite a predicament i would like this type of cover as an optionof course other limiting factors will need to be taken into consideration like on my terms of conditions of employment i am not covered in the case of war invasion revolution or a similar event or in the case of using my vehicle in the area of aircraft are found to be parked taking off or landingas long as those things are all cleared up we can all have a more realistic insurance system this would be a good idea for the general improvement of eve and for a more immersive environment
yeah i agree i was well annoyed last time someone keyed my zealot
holy god look how dumb you are read the dev blog point to where they say anything at all about these changes being for realism issues
remove insurance for global criminals in highsec 05  10 already wheres the realism in my getting insurance using my ship which goes against the law apparently according to concordi personally hate suicide ganking to the core and find it stupid ive only done it once and that was against someone who was mining 237 in a system and left nothing but veldspar in it after i killed him he warped from belt to belt back to station to dock and repeat for hours wonder why macrominer perhaps this was an more then obvious macrominer which in my opinion justifies what i did that time but this was in highsec so yes it doesnt make sense that i get insurance back on my ship performing an illegal action with police concord in system
couple of questions for you guys drawing parralels to rldo i get insurance UFFFDn rl if i set fire to my car with police there this for the selfdestructing ppldo i get insurance in rl if i drive my car to iraq and it get blown up by either insurgents or us military 00 pplno i dont so why should you get that in eve or do you see how off the wall you are when comparing rl to eve
well if you feel like commiting suicide and going to 00 just for the fun of it go do itbut in highsecurity space when you suicidegank others insurance shouldnt apply simple as thatedit ok time too make this deeperif you are dumb enough to commit suicide too go too 00 i dont care have your insurance but when you suicide gank someone you get insurancethe drops of whoever you kill which is easy money without effort and that isnt eve now removing insurance will probably make many of these stop some will continue too try do it since there are ships out there worth taking on with 7 battleships because he might be in a megapimped out battleship
my point is if you validate your point by saying  it is so in rl why shouldnt theese policies count aswell  or do you only want rl comparison when it suits your needsand if you didnt notice i said nothing about suiciding my reply was towards the lets remove insurance its such a good idea while none off you actually think your ideas trough
no i never said that but read what i said exept for that real life  which i obviously shouldnt have added since people get hooked up on it does it make sense too you the whole system with suicide ganking atm
it makes as much sense as the concept of getting insurance on something that is almost certainly going to be destroyed
i am confused i am almost certain i didnt adress my first reply to anybody specific but to the community as a whole im just making a valid point in a thread about insurance when you say a you must say bit wasnt me who where rambling about eve insurance needs to be inline with rl im just saying you cant leave out some rl insurance terms while just grapping what suits youif you want insurance to resemble rl then you must take in the other factors aswell thats my point do you get it now its not a pro suicide response mmmm k
goons against suiciding mechanics that made me chukle hehe
good question people self destructing the ship should not get an insurance payout and again getting involved in any military conflict faction warfare 00 should be exempt or they should pay higher premiums for not looking after their property
only one problem by implementing this you shut out any and all new players that dont sell gtcs from alliance and faction warfare as this will be for the rich ppl eve think about how many bs you would loose during 1 alliance campaign add it up and see how much isk you would need to actually just participateheres another question  how many poor ppl or ppl living under the poverty line in rl have full insurance on health and property
then yes you shouldnt get insurance for setting your own car on fire that thing you said which makes no sense going too iraq thing is somethign worth discussing i would say suit yourself but in eve it would be hard because the game cant know if you go out too 00 to die intensionally or actually try to survive but i guess suicide ganking is in line with setting my car on fireso what about we quit reallife stuff now and continue on with the game discussion hmm
insurance as it stands in the game atm is unrealistic and it just provides a gamey sometimes exploitable tactic to not just cut your losses but nearly avoid them altogether its one of the reasons you see 150 bs fleets suicide jump into a 150 bs gatecamptbh there is no need for insurance except for very limited cases which could be taken care in other ways just remove it from the game and things will change for the better
remove insurance entirely plz it will cut down on blobbing and add consequences to everyones actions not just suicide gankers
please add realistic insurance policies with realistic exclusions of coverage also please give the only insurance company in the game a standard policy of denying all claims and only paying out if the insured appeals oh yeah and dont forget the snarky or bored or inept customer service representatives that insureds have to deal with in order to appeal a denial of coverage tia
i would also like to see doctors employed by the insurance company following you around video taping you all to try to prove that you are faking any injury youve sustained these doctors could replace the convoys constantly exiting high sec stations
i laughedbut yeah do this but i dont quite think that inept should go in the calculation not on capsuleer level
my previous post is a bit facetious but i am seriously in favor of changing how insurance works the insurance company should base the premiums on a players history eg have you lost a lot of ships well then insurance wont be cheap and where the ship will primarily be flown it costs more to insure a ship for use in 00 than in 5 or higherif premiums increase as one loses more and more ships new players should still be able to afford to insure their ships while they are young presumably havent lost many if any ships and have most of their assets tied up in the one or two ships they own as they mature steadily lose more ships because it seems like youre always losing a ship in some way or another and obtain greater liquidity then they will be able to survive the loss of an uninsured ship without ending up brokeit also makes sense that an insurance company would demand a higher premium to insure a ship that is to be used in relatively risky endeavor such as traveling through or fighting in 00 as opposed to futzing about in empire space
do this
i approve of this idea as well while it will regrettably not hinder surprise pvp in any way i expect to see returns on stolen ships in the near future
ahhh someone else agreeing with me about insurance about time ffsyes insurance should be given out to everyone or else you are going to have to look at all the other crazy reasons why people get insurancethe only reason i can think of to nerf insurance on concord related instances is to nerf suicide gankingany other reason and you open up a huge can of worms and even with just a flat out nerf reason the can of worms is half open and is spilling all over the floor
ill keep this as simple as possible there are two types of alts you encounter in eve  the first is basically a second main one a person trains up to do things like fly a falcon missionrun or conduct industry with then theres the second variety ones that are created using the other two slots on an accountthe latter variety serve two annoying purposes in and out of game first they are used to scout dangerous systems with no real risk of loss thanks to their free clones and rookie ships  the only thing they lose upon being ganked by a camp is time getting back to the site in addition to that theyre used to troll on the forums to post stupid topics without fear of being linked to their main and having to backup their words in short anonymity on the internetmy proposal is simple and elegant come a major game patch say ambulation where we will have to redesign our characters looks anyways let each account designate one character to keep and have the others discarded a supplemental option would be say a free onetime character transfer to another paying account without a main if they wanted to keep that altthis would have a few effects first it would cut down on the ease with which alt trolls and scouts could be made forcing people to either post with their mains and be held accountable for what they do and post or make them get trial accounts repeatedlyim not saying this would remove alt scouts entirely or eliminate faceless forum posts what i am saying however is that it would be more annoying for them to do what theyre doing and may discourage the more casual ones among them coupled with other secondary efforts like better moderation it may make a significant impact and improve the quality of discussion here case in point this combined with the initiative ongoing in caod might clean things up quite a bitps wont be monitoring this thread closely feel free to post other ideas you may have refine this a bit whatever
since this is my first time raising an issue i thought i would start with a small one with a fairly simple fixi noticed the other day while abusing my agents lp store but why are the empire and lower end faction mods running with different statsegenergized thermic membrane and all the other specific membranesamarr navy  25tf cpu  40 resist  1mw gridammatar navy  25tf cpu  40 resist  1mw gridkhanid navy  25tf cpu  40 resist  1mw gridgallente navy  25tf cpu  375 resist  1mw griddark blood  25tf cpu  40 resist  1mw gridshadow serpentis  25tf cpu  375 resist  1mw gridtrue sansha  25tf cpu  40 resist  1mw gridenergized adaptive nanoamarr navy  30tf cpu  225 resist  1mw gridammatar navy  30tf cpu  225 resist  1mw gridkhanid navy  30tf cpu  225 resist  1mw gridgallente navy  30tf cpu  20 resist  1mw griddark blood  30tf cpu  225 resist  1mw gridshadow serpentis  30tf cpu  20 resist  1mw gridtrue sansha  30tf cpu  225 resist  1mw gridok i thought maybe its just the armour resist mods that the gallente and serps are getting shafted on but then it just got weirdermedium armour repairerdomination  144 activation  21tf cpu  288 hp rep  12s cycle  150mw gridrepublic fleet  144 activation  21tf cpu  288 hp rep  12s cycle  150mw gridgallente navy  160 activation  21tf cpu  320 hp rep  12s cycle  150mw gridshadow serp  160 activation  21tf cpu  320 hp rep  12s cycle  150mw gridamarr navy  180 activation  21tf cpu  360 hp rep  12s cycle  150mw gridammatar navy  180 activation  21tf cpu  360 hp rep  12s cycle  150mw griddark blood  180 activation  21tf cpu  360 hp rep  12s cycle  150mw gridkhanid navy  180 activation  21tf cpu  360 hp rep  12s cycle  150mw gridtrue sansha  180 activation  21tf cpu  360 hp rep  12s cycle  150mw gridso now we have the same effective item working at different capamount repped across the board over multiple racesfactionswtf is going on herei could show more examples of this from different modules all over the place but i think you all get the point  why are lp awards being valued differently depending on which racefaction you decide to fly for why the disparity in the modules statsi guess the simple issue here is why arent they all the same metalevel and thus have equal stats if they all belong the the same tier of items can we have parity please
and since i cant support it with the original post heres a random alt i created with a cool name
theyre supposed to be different
its intentional amarr and derivativesammatar khanid blood sansha get the best armour stuff followed by gallente and derivativesserpentis followed by minmatar and derivativesangels look around other items  domination webs kick the crap out of everybody elses dread guristas missiles are the best damage in the game and so on no need for a fix here that said youre right the alt does have a cool name
i just found it weird that items that have the same lpisk cost have such varying stats while i like the fact that they are slightly different shouldnt their value also be different as a purchase cost
this i dont mind different factions having different items but having them at same price gallente lp store lpisk ratio is nothing to write home about unlike caldari navy lps as everyone needs those cnrs  or with the fullest expansion of nano craze demand for republic fleet or thukker modified speed mods has risen greatly
now that proposal i rather like keep them different but make them different on the cost side too for that matter maybe make khanid gear tagheavy ammatar cashheavy and amarr lpheavy say  same stats same expected costs but different cost breakdowns
sorry for the cluttersuggestion1 remove the microwarpdrive module from the game2 replace it with an engine power router this module when mounted reduces the total amount of the capacitor and increases the ships mass marginally however it does not consume any power unless activated when activated it increases the ships base speed stacking with afterburners but also reduces the capacitor and shield recharge rate and increases the ships signature the bonuses and penalties induced by this module however are small compared to those of the mwd but one can still fire when using this module and it increases engine strength to help break free of webifiers3 make it so that nanofiber internal structures do not stack at all neither for benefits nor for penalties4 do not change the power of overdrive modules5 tone down missile speeds and explosion velocities until speed tanking with these modules becomes viable but not overpowered balance things out6 do not change the mass of any minmatar shipsrp crapthe engine power router is a direct reactortothruster power link and regulator combined with a reinforcing of certain systems inside a ships engine to allow for greater levels of raw thrust originally designed by the gallente for use on their highspeed assault cruisers it significantly boosts a ships raw engine power and speed at the cost of other systems the systems that make up its construction take a up space from a ships capacitor and add to its mass and with power going directly to the engines this module takes a lot of energy to run the boosted emission of a ships engines also seems to increase its signature fortunately for obvious reasons the module can be shut down once a ship has reached optimal range it was quickly adopted by the minmatar for use on their fast ships with modifications to housing and engine technology then by the amarr because of their considerable expertise with energy systems and typically large power buffer and last by the caldari who realized the dire need to increase their heavy ships speed accordingly and has since seen more and more use among speedier combat ships among the spacelanesskill to mount engine boost rigging under engineering required skills engineering v energy grid upgrades iv high speed maneuvering changes to affect this modulethe thorax and the incursus and their assaultheavy assault ship derivatives should have purposefully built housings for these modules from the start thereby significantly reducing the penalties for using one of these based on skill level the vagabond and the claw should be the only minmatar vessels to have similar bonusesseeing as certain people do not want the mwd to become a rapidtransport sort of tool wanting to keep their precious speed tanks without having to pulse things too much and the thread above is getting as many negative responses as positive i thought that it might be good to suggest more alternatives i cant say that the people who complain about making the mwd travelonly seem like anything but those specifically targeted by the speed nerf from the start and for a reason but they are players nevertheless and taking away speed tanks and making the mwd a mandatory module for breaking webs anyway is not quite a smart move imo
so what youre saying is that you want to balance mwds by making them fill more slots on ship builds that seems like a terrible solution
what not really i just think that the mwd is silly because of its extreme bonuses and penalties not to mention game mechanic and rpwise you dont have to make this thing stack with abs but youd have to make it a bit more effective in that case combine it with the changes to other modules with not bringing down some ships and modules and some other careful changes thoughcome on its a reasonable penalty and better than not being able to firespeed tank at all also it would give some people reasons to mount afterburners and others not
the forum is preferred for a lot of people i have meet because they can operate them from work when not in the client i actually use the new adds and have had some success from the experience i have also used the recruit channel and personal contacts i just get this irritation every time i think about the recruit forums because even news papers and green sheet has managed to divide their want ads into organized categories it is a really easy fix basically the existing becomes an archive and open a few more forum sub threads along more specific search categories

devs read meh
i will be reveiling a plan for bounty hunters in the near future incidentally its not too different from yours 
since war decs are being looked at anyhow isnt it time to ad a game mechanic to right ant wrongs or injustices done to you by members of nonwardecable corporationshow about an individual wardec  a one on one wardec that cannot be renewed nor made mutual  it shouldnt get any discount due to size  barring that purchasble kill rights would be an interesting idea as well as open a player driven and controlled market
i dont think letters of marque apply in this case youve mentioned im given to understand that theyre more of less what faction warfare is all aboutanyway the mechanics you suggest dont offer anything different over wardeccing an entire corpif you hate the guy so much just suicide gank him or something
edit sorry double post
buy some destroyers and have a field day but really people can play the game however they want if it is not people and macros then it is a problem otherwise not really
you think 100 mackinaws named xfadsgde in npc corps that just slowboat back to their cans when i bump them 60km off their cans over and over are anything but macros and besides with ccps shiny new more helpful concord i doubt doing anything about it will be possible with thrashers or any other shipsedit worth mentioning that theyre there 237 take a look sometime for yourself
lol you make a good point in that case macros it is probably take a ship scanner out there see what they have fitted and then go fit a suicide ship like i said a destroyer is cheap and gets the job done well then agian its 07 so you only can do a few before your set status gets too low
youre right thats what im doing right now but like i said if its easy why notwell forget about it its not that my life depends on it it was just an idea that crossed my mindcheers
id love it if the builtin jukebox was improved on general principles but i wouldnt use it thats what i have winamp for
i agree ccp please stop messing with this game and ignore the whiners please this game is super awesome and open ended please dont turn this into wow in space i am not paying 1495 a month to play wow in space i play eve because its original and its not freakin wow and all those other games leave the learning skills just because some noob es that he cant catch up to everyone ignore him and that person should not play eve eve is time consuming yes but thats what makes it so much fun to play

so do you just intent to keep stacking the agenda with every 00sov suggestion that gets postedit seems like every 00 or sov idea that comes up in the assembly hall you will support inside of the first ten posts and agree to bring before the csm you do this before any significant discussion takes place on the issue that is before any wellthoughtout objections can be made you do it before youre able to see if the idea gets any popular traction i know that the idea has to be discussed in the assembly hall for a minimum period of time before the csm can vote on it but you essentially bring the idea to the csm for a discussion and vote regardless of how the suggestion thread pans outfor example the two 00sov ideas on the agenda right now the first one has all of 20 replies the second one has 11 but youre right there in the second post supporting and youve got it on the agenda its absurd if an idea is actually good dont you think that it probably will get more than 6 supportsthe point of the csm is to represent the player base right now youve got two items on the agenda that together have the support of a whopping 20 people from the player base and the csm is going to spend time discussion those ideas can you not at least wait until another idea with some popular support shows up barring that maybe you could wait until a number of other csm reps support an idea hint i mean darius before you bring an idea to the csm so that maybe it will have a chance of passing rather than voting on ideas that capture genuine player concerns youve decided to vote on suggestions that fit your own preconceived agenda i mean my god seven out of ten issues on the agenda right now are yours and for the most part theyre all issues with a mere two pages of player discussion behind them
if the csm was sitting on their thumbs and not addressing any issues posted in the assembly hall unless they have 500 supports wed be pretty ed at them for their laziness i think it makes sense to present a variety of ideas to ccp otherwise the process stagnatesin short are you really blaming the csm for being hardworking
jade to use up 10 of the 15 slotshow about you move all that stupid bull to the end of the line
so you define hardworking as1 see thread with 00 or sov in the title2 open thread3 hit reply4 type please fill this out with a more detailed proposal5 check support6 hit submit7 edit topic into csm agendawell it is a whole seven steps and i didnt even include all the steps needed to edit the agenda so i guess you might have a pointseriously though hardworking in this context would involve an active effort to build a consensus around an idea by soliciting buyin from the relevant base of players and not just 50 random peons im looking at you ankhsh2lfoslvasdlf people who matter in the game guess what bob dont waste much time on this csm crap and most of them dont read the assembly hall or eveo in general many russians or tcf might not even be able to read english a hardworking csm member would be making an effort to get in touch with the important individuals who actually live in 00 and get some feedback from them before tossing the idea off to the rest of the donothing knownothing congress for a vote just because a group of people cant stand these forums doesnt mean that their opinion is irrelvant its highly relevante here is one stepbystep for success1 recognize that 00 is the land of elitist s who dont necessarily bother or have the ability to read eveo remember that ccp doesnt really get involved in big 00 powerblocks after the t20 scandal and that certain players really do know more than the devs do about some aspects of their game get ready to play along with peoples egos to accomplish something2 get a shortlist of people who would be useful to ask about 00 and sov warfare hint one of them sits on the council already the others are major players in the large 00 powerblocks they are people who have played the 00 game for a long time and have bigpicture views as well as a large personal investments in the game and a lot of subordinates to take care of3 present to them whatever idea you have4 incorporate their feedback to improve the idea or if they collectively suggest that the idea is trash then can it5 eventually bring to the csm a plan that has a large chance of being successful if implemented because the people who understand the complicated interwoven bigpicture issues have at least not struck it down outright
if anyone on the csm attempts to do what you describe id be very happy right now though im seeing a lot of work being done by jade to keep getting topics in front of the csm if some people dont wish to be involved in this that is their call but arranging and attending every meeting and scouring the assembly hall forum to find topics to put on the agenda is indeed a lot of work and if jade werent doing it the csm would hardly be addressing anything  i think he deserves more credit than youre giving him
hes certainly putting more effort into the csm than i would put into a video game without compensation but he knew what he was getting into when he signed up and his effort is nevertheless insufficient for this task if something is worth doing then its worth doing right
its being done right we would be very lucky to have more folks putting as much good work in as jade is given the thanklessness of the taskas for the idea of appointing a development group of 00 important individuals  i dont see how handing the keys over to one particular subgroup of players will do anything for balance other than ensure that only development changes beneficial to that subgroup are passed
good point for that matter i wonder why ccp didnt ask a bunch of wow players or even noneveplaying citizens of iceland to form the csm those people would be free of any bias regarding changes to the game and if ccp implements changes requested by those who dont play eve maybe they would start to play it what a bonusoh of course its because you want the people who understand the game and are invested in it to guide the changes its because when you change a game you dont change it in favor of the people who do not play that game you change it in favor of the people who do play that game so as to increase their enjoyment of it and maintain them as loyal subscribers and if they like your improvements they may invite their nonplaying buddies to join in on the funliving in 00 is a game it is a very different game from the one played in highsec or lowsec if the 00 game is changed it should be changed by the people who actually play it and invest in it for their increased enjoyment 00 should not be changed for the benefit and enjoyment of those who have chosen not to play the 00 gamelets change 00 and the sov system is a task that is fundamentally different in scope and in impact than lets change the powergrid on the nighthawk fitting a ship does not really constitute a game the sovereignty system and the mechanics of 00 do constitute a game in the same way that the faction warfare system constitutes a game i guess you would say a minigame a subgame within eve the people who choose to play the sov game should guide its changes in the same way that the people who play eve online should guide changes that apply generally to all of eve onlineeditlook as of posting this my utterly fake parody of an idea about turning highsec into a wow pve server has got more support than either of the ideas that jade has put on the agenda for 00 that is the level of absurdity that were at now
the csm is a particular subgroup of playersthe star fraction has sovereignty in zero solar systems
in the end any aspect of the game should be balanced by developers with an eye towards how all subsystems within the game interact to that point its just a really terrible idea to put veto power over the entire playerbase in the hands of players appointed solely because they have a narrow focus in their gameplay on 00 sov warfareone might as well argue that a council of only nanoship pilots should be selected to address the nanonerf it takes all sides to sort something as big as this out
ccp ask csm to help them come up with proposals to reform sovereignty warfare in 00enough said really
that makes the star fraction one of the last group of individuals qualified to comment on and suggest changes to 00 sovereigntyjade stick to empire high sec issues
ya you keep waving that flag as if my point is that the csm should give up on 00 and sov warfarebut what im actually saying is that the csm should try and address sov warfare in an effective way not by rubberstamping ideas supported by some miniscule number of people for ccp to read by actually putting in the time and the work to build a significant consensus around an ideaif all the ccp devs are asking for is a bunch of ideas cast up by joe messageboardposter then they can get that just by reading the assembly hall they dont need you to vote for them to read itwhat ccp wants the csm to do is the freaking legwork  go out into the field talk to people and figure out what the solution really should be be solution builders and not just a dumb pipeline or filter through which solutions might flowstop lazily expecting the solutions to very hard complicated problems to be dropped on your doorstep by enterprising constituents go out and find the solutions that will work yourselves
negative and on 00 issues if you are interested in a balanced approach to 00 balancing you dont ask a group composed entirely of people too close to the issue you guys are too invested in current 00 defensive advantages to discuss these things objectivity sure you have a right to an opinion but you have absolutely no right to a veto asking people holding 00 space from the current stacked deck of broken sov mechanics about the future 00 warfare is like asking a focus group of turkeys if they are in favor of thanksgiving  nobody should be surprised at the answers that interest group gives
the thing you keep forgetting though is that we already have the opinions of the current status quo and those  lets do nothing ccp also care about the opinions of the people who would like change and would like to make 00 warfare more interesting more dynamic and generally more of a game those minutes are very revealing the impression i get from reading you posts is that feel that people interested in raiding and opposing settlements in 00 have no right to opinion in the direction the game should develop and i strongly disagree with you eve is a game for all the players and i dont believe the current space holders in 00 have the right to veto any change that might make their job of holding territory more challengingyou yourself concluded in kelsins thread that you didnt foresee any solutions that could be implemented within the lifespan of eve online youll forgive me for dismissing that level of cynicism and remaining hopeful that those people who do see a future for non blob warfare laggy logjams in 00 might eventually win this argument and drive positive changesimple defeatism i dont buy it
yes you do because thats the group that has experience of the issue and what they feel is wrong with it you dont ask an accountant to fix your cara semivalid point yes objectivity may well be difficult to achieve but id rather have a car mechanic tell me whats wrong with my car than an accountant yes the mechanic may not be perfectly objective because hed like to get some money out of you but if the final result is that the car works then the mechanic has succeeded and who said anything about veto as a 00 player id rather see proposals from those in or involved with 00strawman and fallacious analogy those who have taken sovereignty defended sovereignty assaulted sovereignty clashed over sovereignty and lost sovereignty are the perfect group to ask about sovereignty
oh really youre certain that the general opinion of say ra or stain empire or solar fleet is that the status quo is good what are you basing that opinion on did nync post that somewhere on eveo did you ask him and what about bob do you have a lot of contacts there who are feeding you information about what they generally thinkjade you dont know  about what people in 00 think and you havent tried to find out you know what you think and you know what you think people who play in 00 think thats itthose people who are close to the issue have an important role to play maybe you dont let them decide every facet of your idea but if it doesnt have any input or feedback from them and ignores their concerns then your idea is useless and the fact is that people with the best insights to give arent just going to come to you for one thing many of them arent going to post feedback here because they dont understand english or imagine a 00 powerhouse russian alliance who might have their breadandbutter game changed out from under them according to suggestions approved by a council that they couldnt provide feed back to because they dont even know it exists its absurdyou need to put forth the effort to solicit the opinions that while they wont show up on an eveo forum are still extremely relevant to the issue you cannot dismiss those opinions by waving your hands and muttering about bias
ah well well agree to disagree life goes on
your analogy would be perfect if you were comparing the turkeys involved in thanksgiving to the control towers involved in 00 sovereignty warfarei dont see you requesting the opinions of the control towers but then control towers dont have opinions hence why your analogy is completely fallacious
imagine youre in iceland discussing your ideas for 00 and sov with the devs the devs hear you out and then look at darius and bane and ask so what did you guys think of the idea you spend all your time doing this stuff then they say we dont think this idea is the way to go certainly something needs to be changed but i think this will anger a lot of veteran players then the devs look at you ask so did anyone who plays in 00 already get on board with this idea what did they think and you say well not many of them contributed to the discussion about the idea i guess they dont care strongly about it i dont think the devs are going to buy thatits in your best interest in doing what i suggest im not sure why you would resist it unless youre simply too lazy to do it even being able to tell the devs something like i talked to some of the head guys in bob and in some russian alliances and all they want is the status quo i think theyll be angry no matter what you do sounds better than they didnt offer any opinions and i didnt go out of my way to askfrankly by not even going to the trouble of asking around you are the one who is being defeatist youre assuming the theres no way to build a real consensus on this issue because you experienced some early frustrationof course you could also just refuse to perform your due diligence with this because some guy in goonswarm made a cynical post on a message board that makes a lot of sense
you really dont get it do you all you have ever done is try to get them to change 00 so your stupid worthless alliance can participate in it well you cant so stop trying to change the game for your own agenda 00 is supposed to be where all the big players of the game emerge and duke it out if you arent cutting it in the current system what makes you think that you will cut it with another system alliance level warfare isnt something someone like you or anyone else with no experience to take a look at and make decisions based off of crap like thattake for example ank and all her stupid crap shes putting forward
empire wars need to stay open warfare is why i started playing eve in the first place and also too many damn carebears running round and whining all the time on the forums o boohoo i got suicide ganked while afk hauling ur a dumbass if u do that jeez leave the ing game alone for s sake all this nerfing this n nerfing that is catoring to the whiners and carebears i like the nano nerf tho cuz nano gangs r annoying to no ends and all they do is run away neway when they get engaged this game was awesome when i first start over a yr and a half ago now am not so sure cuz this in turning into wow in space

there is no point in mining in low sec as you can make as much profit in high sec nevermind the risk in low sec is greater than 00 for mining low sec needs boosted badly

me so how do you manage to be able to read through all these threadscsm member well were just lucky that ccp pays us a living stipend because if we actually had to spend eight hours a day at work then we wouldnt have the time to read through all the threads its a fulltime job really    especially considering the fact that we still want to be able to play the gameme so you dont think that the ratio of 9250000 is impractical or otherwise logistically impossiblecsm member not at all i mean if we couldnt devote eight hours of every day to reading threads picking out the ones that are actually insightful and discussing them amongst ourselves then this wouldnt be a democratic process at allme so in other words you are confident that you are able to best serve the eve population because you have more than enough time to be a functional member of the csmcsm member of course i can assure you that we are more than able to give everyones threads and concerns enough attention luckily all of the threads are posted by genuinely concerned players who have thought carefully about whether or not their topic is appropriate and reasonable furthermore the threads are all wellwritten concise and come from nonselfish and fairnessbased perspectivesme well    in that case    this must be a rewarding and productive position indeedcsm members yes sir the trip to iceland is just the icing on the cakeme im convinced
in all seriousness   give the csm a freaking break already

signedps ccp you suck at lifethis is an individual rant that really doesnt have much to do with the nano nerf but over the past few months my experience with ccp staff has been extremely badthus i might quit eve for greener pastures so i can flame ccp and not really careno you can not have my stuff i would destroy it before i would give it to youccp you are all gigantic gots now go die by head trauma from a pencil now or something you gay pedogots

oh for gods sake fix it
so we know the industry standard excuse was so much bs it was just a price hike as the csm found out in their meetingwe know the it is too expensive for ccp to have more than one type of card is nonsense since the japanese now get 50 day cardsso ccp stop being corporate speak buffoons and deliver choice to your customers through a variety of card types30 60 90 and even 180 or 360 cards and bring back the old dollar prices
yes we get so much marketing bs from ccp about reasons for only having one type of card then they the japanese 50 day cardsare ccp too stupid to see the irony of this decions after all the nonsense they have told the csm and the players about the cardsbe a good service company ccp and give us your customers gtc choice

jade could you say all that but in a shorter way plz i carnt read it all properly 
you forgot to tell the story of how you were in an empty system and couldnt tell it was empty so you wasted 20 minutes scanning and found nothingor the story of how a couple missioners in the same system wanted to fleet up with some one to speed things along but cant or perhaps the story or of the miner who suddenly started to get his ass handed to him by a handful of rat frigates and couldnt even yell help call it a distress signal if you want fancy storytelling or how about the time you find several people who youd like to talk to at the same time but you have to convo them all individually instead of saying hey guys lets insert meaningless social activity that carbears do hereor how about just wanting to get on the damn radio and talk to anyone whose out there because youre ing bored and you wanna see whose out thereyou seem to forget that eve is a social game local will never go away because of this local could be changed to not display anyone in the local sidebar unless they decided to talk in local somewhat the way other chat channels do only a lot faster but to simply make such a powerful socializing tool just vanish is excuse me ing stupidif giving away your presence is what youre worried about perhaps a few line of codes can be added that remove you from local while your cloaked but if surpises is what you want then just go with the above idea edited emphasizing the important parts
these types of channels are called recent speakers and im going to promote that until something better comes alongbut i agree completely that just poof removing local wouldnt work and voting for such a total removal will not prompt ccp to do it any faster than never but removing the intel gathering aspect the names and faces would alleviate the problem while still leaving the chat function itself intact
so what you saying if someone deside to go out mine alone in syetm with 5 gates he must to find 5 ppl to cover it those gates dont beleave they will do it for free and how much profit will ppl get afteri dont know like i said i like idea in general but it can bring lots of concequnces with it and have poseble huge impact on 00 population on the long runnow we did read the story showed from one side combat situation and it is sound fun but what about if you travel from dest a to dest b  we all do arent we and we all have local open and trying to get fast to our destenation and dont run in the camp or atleast try to avoid in this scenarion you will have 2 optionsa run like headless chiken and hope you dont get in any camp on your wayb you have to scan every system you enter and will cost you alot of time to finish your jurneymy 2 centscyb
there is perfectly nothing wrong with pay to grief welcome to eve you have options to get out of wardecs like disbanding corps and the likefurthermore the whole victory conditions thing  can we expect to be teleported to a instance so we can do a honourable 5v5 and then whoever kills most ships get victory points or what defenders having to agree with being assaultededit i was being sarcastic not providing ideas
ccp eve is a sandbox game stop it with victory conditionswhen i decide to war dec a corp because i dislike their ceo i set my own victory conditions ie force his corp to disband deal x amount of financial damage prevent xyz from happeningvictory conditions predetermined ones no thats what guild wars has and some people play guild wars eve has player made goals remember that sanbox you advertised to medont detract from the game because the vocal minority cant keep their mouth shut on the forums and in local maybe 1 of the war declarations are random i do not declare war on a random target and i believe nobody else does either a lot of time and effort goes into some war efforts even against defenceless corps a lot of research and scouting must be done and targets only become targets because something about them conflicts with something about the agressor
also as another forum dweller put simply and accuratelysince when is a real war dictated by what the defenders want
personally i like the idea of of multiple types of wardecs some with victory conditions and some without the mercenary idea is also pretty solidif the current griefer wardec option was to still be available then perhaps another kind of victory condition would work as a quick idea perhaps the insurance payouts on attacker ships where a defender is on the kill mail would be split in some way somenone to the attacker who died and someall would go to the defender corpso in effect you could choose to pirate in high sec with the stipulation that you no longer get full insurance when you die fighting the folks you wardecced or the mercs hired by them to fight back for the defenders and hired mercs this would be like a bounty system you get paid for each attacker you killwhether it should be the entire insurance payment or just part would have to be balanced maybe it would depend on the sec rating of the system where it happened sec status of the attacker killed or something else also the payment is only for kills in high sec and not for any kills in lownull sec
war decs are made by those with their own goals and agenda just because victory conditions arent a part of the mechanics doesnt mean they dont exist why do you feel the need to interfere in everythingthe defender can choose to fight back and attempt to make the war unprofitable for the attacker they can also choose not to what exactky is the problem why do you feel the need to impose ccp conditions and goals on warsagain why does there have to be a reason other than killing and pillaging thats what half of eve enjoys doing so why attempt to deter it the other half gets enough protection as it is by hiding in npc corpsgrouping together for safety works or doesnt work depending on how well the group is organized why on earth should the mere existence of a group give safety ccp understands very little and it concerns me that csms are jumping on the ccp bandwagon
i agree with everything you said except this its not that the existence of a group gives safety the problem is that too often huge pvp corp finds smaller corp and wardecs them with no real disincentive it basically means join a huge corp or dont join one at all which is stupidscalable payments based on the relative sizes of the parties in the war would be fine enough to discourage random wardecs on tiny corps not enough to stop people from doing it if they actively dislike said corp
the point being made is that small corps are softer targets than larger ones and are just as easy to wardec and attack instead of small corps being warred by corps their own size they are being sucessfully warred by much larger entities than themselves as has already been said this is a downward pressure on small corps and pushes people to join bigger ones that are less likely to be wardecced a small rebalancing of the fee system based on corp size should do the trick youll still be able to declare war on a small corp but itll cost you a lot more than fighting one your own sizeim afraid that my suggestions may be lost at the bottom of page 3 but chances are ccp wont even read them anyway the threads a month old in my considered opinion ccp need to use a very light touch with this issue rather than completely redefining the purpose and uses of wardecs wardecs are a social tool and screwing with its current use will  a lot of people off and detract from eves political and social style as a sandbox game theres nothing wrong with social darwinism or paytopvp and nonconsentual wardecs are not griefing by ccps official knowledgebase definition of the term theres no need to completely redesign the entire system or force people to play a different way than they already do as per my suggestions on page 3 some additional optional tools for victory conditions and a rebalancing of war fees is all thats needed
yes anything coupled with a nerf to highsec is better than a simple buff to 00 rewards
signed riskreward in highsec is utterly broken by l4 missions
not as easy as people think depending on your computer and connection quality if you are laggy or the session change takes too long or it takes too long to register your action on the server the fight can be over pretty quicklylast night i was in a situation where i was able to successfully get one click in which was a warp too before both my ship and my pod blew no modules no aligning just poof then poof so spamming doesnt always worki know there are people who have it down pat i just dont accept that it works for everyone or is even viable on poor connections
this is a buff to 00 rewards bringing the masses to progressively lower sec for you to gankdont like it  mainly because it will make it harder to earn isk while simultainiously raising the prices on virtually everything except maybe veld
thats funny one of the reasons i like the proposal is this same reason
support rebalacing riskreward of 00 vs lowsec vs highsec making agentsagent qualityroid contents dynamic or at least pushing better resources to lower security

love the idea and a simple solution to the gun cycle problem would be that turning on your guns automatically turns off your mwd and vice versa also id like to see tracking on neuts but thats for another time i think
i likesigned
i like this idea simple elegant makes a wonderful distinction in role and function between afterburners and mwds i really hope ccp will give this a serious look
signedat least this way their wont be too many unknown sideeffects or drastic changes in our playing environment while tackling the problem
ok so they remove local and then the miner cant see you jump in said miner that you jump in on is aligned to gatetowerwhatever sees you arrive you lock in seconds scram whatever before he can warp and blow him up he wont even have chance to initiate warp if youre cloaked and decloak to lock and fire how is that fairhow it is now is how it should stay i reiterate my point it should be harder to kill a miner than for the miner to survive it should be harder to earn a dishonest living than an honest living unless of course they want to make eve more like the wild west than it already isand you want to take on miners 00 or whatever with a titan there is no way i can support make it easier you already have more advantages that the hulk pilot with a ship like thatab
when looking at potential changes in game mechanics i always ask how would this be in real lifein real life when a soldier or group of soldiers enters an area they know theyre there but not who else is there until they actually encounter them somehow seeing them hearing them etc theoretically in some futuristic universe thats been colonized the technology may exist where a ship automatically actively scans the local region upon entry discovering other objects and ships do we see this in star wars star trek robert heinleins books etc in any of the spacebased entertainment models no just very rarely and usually only in circumstances where other objectsships in local space are aggressive or active or anything but running passive scannersso to follow this logically and as it wouldcould apply to real life or the accepted norms of science fiction i support this but believe it merits further discussion possibly objects show up that are broadcasting their presence in combat for example or who have just jumped in gravity  mass changes in local space for larger ships of course or are broadcasting in local channel for example but these all may follow some kind of radar decay time before they fall off the list there are a lot of possibilities to explore hereon the other hand i can see the logic behind keeping it this is after all an mmo and on purpose of all mmos is to bring people together removing the list in local would add a certain layer of emptiness and loneliness that can possibly be filled by being active in other channels that while i feel would be more realistic to the vastness of space may drive some players of the game
youre right how is it fair its not but neither is life you think if i while driving down the road suddenly swerve onto the sidewalk am giving any pedestrians walking there any advance notice they take their chances jsut like me any incoming player may or may not know that some miner is there hes taking a chance by jumping in and taking a look around not everybody has cloaks no this idea only adds to the interest and risk of teh game and for me that is the 1 draw of this gameso what if the miners and industrialists cant see you coming so much the better for hunting macrominers should that brand of crap decide to venture into lowsecnullsec happy hunting
removing local and not implementing anything else will swing the advantage from the ratter having an insane intel advantage to the ganker being able to gank helpless rattersminers all day long without increased rewards ratting and mining in 00 would probably disappear do not tell me a roaming gang will not know if someone is probably ratting or mining in a system f10 tells you this info ratters and miners usually do not move between systems so a simple look at your f10 map highlight npcs destroyed in last hour average people in system in the last 30 minutse and you find your ratters and miners then it just takes a covops with a few probes to find a miner personally it would take less than a minute 20 to get a 0km warpin on someone in a system 80 au wide smallest systems i can do it in under 30 seconds the f10 map however will not tell you if a ganker is coming so that begs the question with the autoscanner pick up probes what about probes that can probe your ship outside scan range otherwise people once again will have to mash the directional scanner over and over to make sure they dont lose out using the above probe speeds you would have to dscan for probes every 10 seconds in order to maintain some security or put a scout in the next system in every connecting system which will substantially lower the isk you can make unless you abuse free trial alts
well not signedalternativethe only thing even close that i would support is making a special skill and cloaking device for covert ops only that allows a shipplayers removal from local with sufficient disadvanages the most important being that the removal from local could not be passive this way it would give the players in local a chance to notice the cloakee on his entry before he goes dark also while sublocal active no group player should be allowed to warp to him until he is added back to local
you crazy or something you think they dont have it hard enoughalso bump
the riskreward imbalance in highsec definitely needs a good look
again 175 players doing anything generating money will make a lot of money but if all you want is to have level 4 agents in 00 you can have how much of those that you want start a thread asking for them and i will give my support
but those 175 players should be able to make a decision based on risk reward make a little isk in nearperfect safety more isk with some risk much more isk with even higher riskthe problem is that the carrying capacity of player 00 is much less than empire 1 agent can support perhaps 750 players assuming they want to mission 6hrsday making as much as 120150mday each i certainly would like to see more regions of npc sov 00 added but thats a seperate issue what im concerned about is the value of player sov 00 vs hisec with the possible exception of a very few very good areas its far out of kilter the huge sums of isk that can be risklessly generated in empire are distorting them game witness the desperate remarks of those who are addicted to the sugarteat
take a 1000 mans alliance  look the total isk generated by all the activity and remove all the isk lost to keep the activities running oo sov includedtake 1000 level 4 mission runners total all the isk generated by all the activities related to mission running included recycling the loot selling it ecc and remove the costs who has more isk worth at the end my bet is for the allianceyes they need more space to do that but you really want 100 players in each 00 systemyou want a equal spread of eve population in all systems with 5 players for systemto me it seem it will completely remove the meaning of 00 as the wilderness
in that case would you support a very large expansion of 00 both player and to a lesser extent npc to increase its carrying capacity without losing that wilderness feeling if so i would be right beside youeg 12 player sov and 4 npc sov regions
ok for me even more if they are linked to the main regions maybe adding some more low sec instead of adding them at the end of a chain of 00 regions
try to calculate how many systems you need to control to support 175 ratters that should make at least as much iskhr as lvl 4 missions then try to figure out how much time you would need to spend to defend it and look at the profitability of 00
i like all of these ideas they give a strong reason to progress to low sec00 just like how rattingmining does although mining not so much i would change the 1 mission per day to 7 missions per week so people dont feel they have to log on every single day to run a mission and also the casual player who runs missions on the weekend can do it all he wantsvenkul mul you have to be dense in the head if you think 1000 00 alliance can out cash a 1000 mission runners in high sec one hostile nano gang interrupting your territyory and what is that 45 hours of your isk making gone let alone that most systems can only handle 14 ratters and the rocks pop very quickly also add to the fact that high sec has stations in every system and all have refiningfactory etc while in low sec you need to fuel tens of poss and jbs and stuff that take time from making isk you mistakenly think that each 00 region has dysprosium moons in every system and no one ever comes to raid in a nano gang to gank people a lot of 00 regions are quite poor which is a complete 180 difference from high seci have done level 45 missions for every faction i have ratted in 10 tru sec and i have run pos reaction chains i choose to mission in high sec because it gives me the most for the least amount of effort by fari am also pretty disgusted by that legit troll in which i had to read maybe 15 posts that were all edited out if you dont have the balls to admit you are wrong or agree to disagree then stfu
id particularly like to see the 4 npc 00 regions with lots of losec entrances 810 each to provide some especially accessible 00 for newer players the player sov regions can be much as we have now as long as theyre not worthless trash like geminate
i completely support all these ideas it needs to be looked at for sure but if ccp wont change anything it will just show how eve is carebearised today
unless someone else places a buy order for 19either way trade still isnt an infinate resource that you can plug over and over and always come out with huge payouts even if you find a good trade nitch it will only profit at a certain rates you cant do the npc run over and over and get the same payout each time and trade with pc goods is limited by players filling the order so it has breaks on it too
i was recently gone for a month of vacation i got back hopped in my dominix and after checking to be sure that i didnt have any insurance expiration notification for my ship flew it through a gate and promptly got blown up a request for reimbursement was denied apparently i am supposed to be clairvoyant and know that the ships insurance has expired without receiving a notification to that effect the actual response was something along the lines of well thats the way the game mechanics work so tough luck the only way to get a notification that your insurance has expired it seems is by going to a station and opening the insurance tab these insurance executives should be shot who runs a business that doesnt give you notification of expired insurance until youre putting insurance on your replacement ship isnt that a little too lateplease we need some regulation of these companies it is almost as if theyre trying to avoid paying us for our losses if thats the case they shouldnt be in the insurance business perhaps when you hop into an uninsured ship and try to launch a little reminder could pop up in your hud heads up display for you insurance agents saying hey are you sure you want to blow up after all youre not insured or maybe the automated notification system could key off of a timer that is set for each ship when insurance is purchased
i fully agree with this post signed
agreed
1 this is ccp greyscales idea he posted in the features and ideas discussion forum here i am not claiming any credit for the idea i am merely placing it in the assembly hall for something the csm could further discuss with ccpto sum the idea up it would allow the creation of fuel pellets from the 6 base fuels not liquid ozone and heavy water to streamline the pos fueling process2i also believe it would be a good change to adjust the fuel bay sizes on towers to allow a maximum fuel storage to last 4 weeks keeping the 25 sovereignty bonus would increase that time to 5 weeks helping the numbers remain manageableoverall this would be a slight increase in fuel times while creating the ability to make a simpler scheduleplease vote on the core of the idea and not the numbers so much because they can be changed freely by ccp
fuel pellets make perfect sense im actually kind of amazed ccp hasnt brought them in already as long as theres a transition period12 months to let people only have to fill towers with pellets on their next refuel afterwards and it doesnt bugger up me and factory slots for the next million years this is just good sense as for the fuel bay size increase it seems sensible we want this game to be relatively painless for those doing the scut work and refueling less often is a good way of doing that given that strontium is now separate there shouldnt be any problems around that
i disagree it discourages players from grouping with people that would reduce their bonuses for example 3 amaar pilots show up and one caldari guess whose not going to get a fleet inviteanother dumb idea you want bonuses get a command ship thats what they are made for
what about people who fly amarr theyre a minority and as such any amarr skilled player would be pretty much forced to train over to gallente to be of any use to their corp you would be pushing their numbers down and greatly increasing the most popular races as the most common now becomes the best to flypeople should not be forced into flying a certain race to be able to get in a gang with their corp imagine if your corp were caldari aligned so everyone was training down that road as its the only logical thing for a member to do then something happens you leave that corp and end up joining a friends corp who happens to be gallenteconsidering the huge difference in the skillsets between those races youre pretty forcing players to either ignore their current skillset and train to align with the corp or find another corp that happens to fit theirs bettermost corps are not going to be able to field multiple gangs every night catering for the different races of their members these changes would put up a large barrier to getting into pvp for a significant proportion of playersto put it really simply is trained as bs corp is a mix of c  d doesnt want to train c or d really likes his corp and doesnt want find a corp of b youre screwed
to clarify jade  how do you intend on presenting this idea it should be finetuned to maximize its chances of passing and be somewhat specific rather than the more vague racial fleets should be better than mixed which surely will not get passedcurrent optionssinglerace fleets get bonusessolid arguments against this in the threadcommand ships are better at certain racial warfare links currently implemented but not working too much skill requirement to usenavy doctrine mindlinks that increase gang bonuses to ships of that race my current favoritecurrent mindlinks give a 50 bonus to gangassist modulesminmatar navy doctrine examplerepublic fleet mindlink75 increase to skirmish warfare link and 50 increase to siege warfare link bonuses transmitted to minmatar ships
i support this idea the reason i support it has more to do with the command ships themselves than the actual idea itself however currently of all the command ship bonuses that are available very few have actual practical use or racial congruence example the eos gives bonuses to information warfare which directly affects ecm better than anything else in the game ecm is caldari from a racial standpoint this is extremely silly furthermore some of the links have very limitedfocused uses that fall short in a real fleet situation like the repair amount bonus on the armor links ehp is far more importantbesides nonmixed racial bonuses would fit nicely into the factional warfare scheme they currently have running if you get hired by the caldari militia you wouldnt think they would be happy you are using gallente ships right this idea needs tweaking and really should center around command shipsincomplete rambling but ohwelledit if anything this should not affect balancing ships outside races mixed fleets should still be viable options and another aspect that makes this interesting is the current corphiring mechanics there is a skill needed to hire characters outside of your own race odd eh
indeed single race fleets shouldnt be the choice but they should be a choice and a good one at thathow though would you stop people from just making one gang per race
cancelling mod effects may go a bit far since it would make it near impossible to tackle titans adding in 25000 damage to the effect would do enough to kill some support and dronesfighters while still making racial tanking dictors viable and requiring 3 titans to do the former job of 1 3 titans is 3 x the riskinvestment and timing to achieve total fleet wipeout that is far far harder to do than just 1 ship
agree
this it goes very well with the upcoming industry expansion where all modules are built from components of some kind loot should be removed and damaged forms of these components should be included in the salvage yield bring this to ccp as an realistic and intuitive extension of module components and ill support it

the main trouble with this topic as i see it is that everyone is on a different page so to speak waldo is against farmers henriette is mad about macros and jack cant stand isk sellers these are all different things which of course may become subsets of the othersunless we can first agree on clearly defined behavior were trying to stop this will remain a goose chaseccp have made it pretty clear that they are against isk selling they havent taken a stand against 10 farmers killing 1 rock in the belt and why should they that seems pretty ineffective to me anywaypeople farm in the game for different reasons not all of which lead to outside sale of isk i dont believe its wrong for me to sit in an ice belt all day and mine for my corps pos just because someone else doesnt have the time to do that farming by its very nature is repetitious and sometimes boring but it is a neccessary part of the game that said marcos are not nice they allow activity when you are away for extended periods there should be someone on the business end of any laserflight stick within reason the question is how do you stop them in a way that doesnt hamper others this is a much harder question than the what do we do about isk retailer question just because i choose not to say hi to you doesnt make me a macro user just because i mining fast with others doesnt make me a macroer heck if i fall asleep in a belt because its boring im not a marcoer either lastly i would submit that its not a crime against the eula to use more than one account at the same time in fact ccp even seem to encourge this with some promotions nor is it against the eula be a foreign speaking grinder we have to be careful how we handle this problem or i fear the only ones that will really be punished will be the innocent
thanks for your support so far i would be pleased if one of the csms would post a comment on this as well though
procuror needs love before covetor does as it is only use for those is to make skiffs
heh there is that toothe procuror would make a great ninja mining ship with a few minor changes well that and making it worthwhile to ninja mine in the first place
hopefully this suggestion will be read through the haze of whines as was said earlier in this thread 1 i see a lot of good constructive ideas in here amidst the complaints and discussion thank you those who have actually contributed something of value2 way to go ccp for following through with the csm process and your own review of the situation cant wait for tradable kill rights 3 one more suggestion for review by ccp what if concord were to assist those being attacked through shield transfer would it not be more realistic to have only a few proportional response craft as opposed to a gargantuan concordokken blob picture it concord vessels shield transfer to the ship in distress so it doesnt die immediately a webscram of the attackers and an actual fight between the offenders and concord if the battle goes sour for the pirates gankers they can leave if more gankers join the fight concord can warp in more reinforcements this would depend of course on balance the concord response would have to match both the dps of the agressors andor their ship types good points of my idea people get their pvp pirats versus concord more realistic defense for the defending ship i say realistic because the likelihood of an infinite number of uberpowerful concord vessels waiting to be deployed seems farfetchedbad points of my idea hard to balance properly so that gankers still have a chance to obtain the benefit for their risk ie pop the target shipalternative option once the agressors engage anyone with a positive sec status insystem gets a free agro and bookmark on the attackers for the duration of the battle until attackers die or escape this would increase the pvp increase the defenders chances and decrease boring automated police who remove the funbenefit of being a pirateokay  discuss interested to hear feedback from both sides of the fence 
interesting idea but if im not mistaken concord already has something of a proportional response based upon the level of solar system sec and on the persistence of the attackwhere this idea really breaks down is in forgetting about concord response time current response times allow the suicide attacker to obliterate the attacked ship before concord arrives and kills the suicider if the attacked ship is already dead it isnt going to benefit from a concord offer of shield transferi dont quite see how this would work well the whole point of suicide ganks is to kill the target in seconds before concord can kill the suicider theres very little chance other players will be able to get to the suicider before concord unless the player happens to already be on scene and once concord does respond its usually with a lot more force than a player can bring to bearwindjammer
why dont the drones just continue to attack the rats etc if you disconnect and then return to your control when you return since we get the lag drawback of drones acting like players on the grid why dont we get the benefit of them behaving like them this means that people wouldnt log off as an exploit but would give the drones a fighting chance of survival
next they will be suggesting a easynormalhard option for evei have to disagree if you cant afford to lose it dont use it not supported
well no theyre not attached to the ship thats one of their downsides travel time to from and between targetsi agree the programming which controls them can be used as a story line justification for the ops desired behaviour currently there really isnt an rp line of explanation for what occurs to cause emergency warp out it would be easy to invent one but i havent seen it done so far something along the lines of an onboard power surge causing a ship wide computer crash which breaks the neural interface between ship and pod this then engages emergency fail safes which include an automatic emergency warp out etc this could easily include a provision for any deployed dronesthe baseball analogy breaks down too easily you could say that missiles or projectiles are like baseballs and that would work drones arent a weapon youre throwing at an enemy your baseballs missiles projectiles either hit or miss and then stay where they are they arent designed to come back drones are mobile guns which are designed to come backwindjammer
using that reasoning would you be happy if you lost your ship everytime your isp failed or your computer crashed or the client crashed or the cat walked across your keyboard etc how about if you just lost your guns andor launchers evertime one of those things happenedwindjammer
ill add my signature to the petition if this can be reasonably implemented it should be implemented im going to also agree that this should only really apply when pvp timers have not been engaged ie when running missions ratting andor mining
no reason not to support it in this form
sure theyre designed to come back when you command them to do soare you sending that command no if you fly away after a fight do they automatically come back nowhy would it be any different to assume that they would just return to your ship when you emergency warp out especially given the possibility that youre performing a logoffskidont get me wrong  from an rp aspect the computers could suddenly engage the callback command having them warp with you but given the chance that logoffski happens likely possibly more often than people losing connection why dont we just leave it status quoid also argue that if you are having consistent connectivity issues you should damn well do something about it  its not always ccps fault that your computer your isp or your technical skillset sucks
im not the one to salvage much when ratting but today i gave it a shot and was shocked to see i couldnt use tractor beams on someone elses wrecks and cans in 00 its 00 are my tractor beams sentient and conscious objectors fix tractor beams in 00
you know when i think about it sure the post is a parodytrollwhatever and the concentual pvp thing is kinda silly given eve i could actually see a dueling system to have some valuefor comparison i am thinking of the autoduel universe a game with a pretty harsh backstore some protected areas lots of lawless regions controlled by gangscorperationsministatesetcone thing the universe had though was both a dualing circuit vehicles going in had cost limitations and cash prize going out and more relavent to this a limited corperate war system where sure corperations would go fully toe to toe in lawless areas but there was also a system in place that they could utitilize a regulated limited war framework enforced by the strong police areas you set parameters number and value of units victory conditions and what was at stake switch control of a territory resource transfer etc etcright now its just sorta war or no war at least from a game mechanic perspective
nope silly goon eve is for big kids another attempt by goons to subvert the nature of eve he knows it is an asinine idea but he would push it just to see what happens
we have a dueling system you want to fight consentual pvp with a noncorpieor npc corpie in highsec drop a can with one unit of something worthless in it  ammo a spare trit you keep on hand for the purpose whatever steal it thief drops it you steal it back and you both have 15 minute timers on each other its not perfect but its pretty good failing that fire up singularityespecially if you like the ops crazy no ship death bit
may as well get it over withdevs dont have the balls to admit it but yeahs thats whats going on
nod quite true players have found a way to do itand im not saying a contractlike system would be worth the development effort i am just saying i could see some value to it
certainly that is a solution but it isnt terribly elegant a formal dueling system would be nice but its definitely not a priority
i support this ideamost of the hate and frustration we see on the forums daily is because people are confused over what the hell this game isclear delineations like the op proposes would stop all this subterfuge and sneky  ccp are drip drip driping in  and eveyone would know where they standskunk
20 goons managed to create such a  storm by suiciding hulks for a few months that the forums were awash with complaints and we got a nerf to suicide gankinggoons have the power to change evesupporting this
ahhh ha ha ha rofli just read the title gigglenot
yes finally a good idea but just one more change maybee canUFFFDt we also have the opertunity to press the nonpvp button during a fight for exampel i say yes to a pvp fight but during this i see that my ship starts taking hits and iUFFFDm down to structure so i can now press the noidonUFFFDtwantto pvp button and see concord kill my opponentin and save my ship 
too complicated a better idea would be to automatically stop all fights when you reach 1 stucture you are then teleported back to the closest station with your damaged ship and can either rep the ship at the station spending a bit of isk or you can fly in your pod to the place where you lost the fight and pick up your ship there in that case the ship you pick up would be whole again with no need for repairsi think this would bring more people into pvp
you know if the ship could be stolen in its 1 state while the looser is podding around i would actually be in favor of this ive always thought eve could use a real salvage system where you could obtain heavily damaged but otherwise intact prize ships
no it shouldnt be allowed to be stolen concord should protect the ship and blow anyone approaching it up
i stopped reading right here i dont care what the rest of your post says i stopped playing wow a long time ago and do not wish to play wow in space
then you missed the obvious hilarity that a sarcastic troll post can ensue check my post at the top of this page
you misunderstand this may be a joke post but it still es me off when anyone even talks about this pvp flagging in high sec why because some moron on the csm panel will run with it because they will think it is a real good idea
i dont think the csm has brought forward a parody thread yet even ank epic carebear that she is hasnt yet posted in favour of this thread and i dont expect that she will give them at least a tiny amount of credit
at which point during the next x1 nerf patch ccp repurposes the snowball launchers into concord repellant

i think some sort of scaling can be done for the tower after reinforced my main point is to look at the strategic initiation and targeting utilizing small gangs as apposed to the destruction of the towers
recently my corp was ransomed and because we refused to pay we were basically pinned in a station we maybe miners but we couldnt even come up with that in the time alotted if we triedit got me thinking heres a few idea to help those like me1 make non mutal wars end one week from the day they can open fire legally with a downtime before then can resubmit onethat way if a young corp gets war decd they have a chance to build some skills and maybe defend themselves next time2alot of people buy mot build pilots ruining the quaility of the game perhaps ccp should make it so transfer have to have the same billing adress to keep thing chalenging3 im told ccp would like us to mine with secure cans i would like to voice the need for bigger non station cans seriously any miner would agree 275k unsafe is far better then 39k safe
what do 2 and 3 have to do with the wardec system
why not remove wars entirelly its griefing apparently
remove wars completly lol wtf high sec would be to much safe then wars are part of peoples lives tbh removing that will make more players angry d
its as good as done already as corp hopping is legalhow any1 gets pinned into a war is beyond me
i came up with these two ideas in response to issues raised on the csm discussion for the specific changes to sov threadin the discussion there are two rather distinct groups concerned about implications large 00 powers understandably do not want to turn 00 into a giant capture the flag game as if anyone who flies into 00 can get a participation ribbon nonlarge 00 entities would like to see more fluidity to the mechanics such that their ability to field the largest capital fleet is not the only measure of how well they can plant their flag in 00 am i right on these two concerns inviting statements especially from jade and darius to steer this proposal in the most successful direction prior to any escalationproposal abstractpos modulation arrays offgrid direct involvement in pos combat lower fuel requirements and increase grid at the expense of more indirect tower exposureferry drones automated haulers that greatly simplify pos management but are vulnerable and fit will with the riskreward mantra of evesov mechanics and pos issuesin the numerous ccp fix lag now threads and talks of antiblobbing mechanics its often brought up that starbases contribute significantly to the reality that blobbing is a winning strategy other concerns mentioned in this ccp thread i beleive all these concerns are interrelated and can be effectively addressed together to bring great justice to tranquility goalspos warfare happens across several grids in a meaningful way that creates more challenging engagement dynamics fun and reduces lag to delay the onset of skillnegating lagfests which operate to neutralize the impact of good tacticslogistics is much easier to 00 powers who wish to set up their infrastructure to take care of itself the price is increased exposure to non sovchanging threats the reward for all is more frequent smallgang forays into friendly territory and the good pvp that providesground rulesany changes to sov mechanics and pos warfare that give more fluidity and exposure to smaller gangs must come with additional advantages afforded to 00 powersbecause lag is a problem that affects everyone negatively and because singlegrid blob warfare is where the worst cases of lag are seen moves to break up pos warfare battles to several grids should be nonvoluntary as nonvoluntary changes they must be focused on breaking up pos battles across multiple grids to ease lag not on giving out free 00 to anyone who can fly a shipsince starbase logistics only affect sitting 00 powers changes to starbases logistics should be voluntary such that nonparticipation is an option when its strategically disadvantageous the changes must focus on making starbase logistics easier with a consequence of increased exposure to small threatsthis isnt about moar should or shouldnt be better its about fighting stayathome tactics reducing lag fests and breaking up blobs moar is better however with the current state of lag and blob encouraging mechanics better is not as much better as simply bringing moar
control tower modulation array new offgrid structure for pos warfare and logistics burden reducing called modulation array deployed at control tower where it warps to a location offgrid and anchors itself sized arrays every tower can field four arrays the rp explanation is that the arrays create a field between the array and the tower that harvests gravity field flux as a power source and lowers starbase fuel requirements while raising starbase power grid current towers should get a decrease in available power grid as this is a nonvoluntary change where nonparticipation comes with a pricelogistics burden reducingfor logistics the job of the arrays is very simple modules anchored at the tower can be set to take power from an array which requires no fuel and thus the amount of fuel required for a tower is decreased by having arrays since the array allows the tower to not have to rely so much on its internal facilities all fuel type consumption should be decreasedcombat overviewfor combat there should be a complex set of transactions between the tower and its arrays that will satisfy the following requirementsdiminished returns for force present at one location compared to spread out forces at several locations arraysinability to treat arrays as stepping stones where blobbing them sequentially replaces blobbing the towerdraft of specific combat behaviorarrays repair towerwhen the tower is below full shield arrays will begin charging up a shield burst to send to the tower what is a shield burst imagine the energy sifter from predator twenty or so little blue fireflies of shield energy that are targetable are spawned they move at frigweapon speeds and grow in charge and size geometrically as they get larger the slow down they coalesce and eventually form a single ball with a very high rate of shield building when its complete it is sent to the tower at 10kms where it adds 1m shield the charge is cyclic defeating one cycle early means it wont begin charging again until the next cycle would normally beginarray reinforcingwhenever an array is damaged to 25 it goes into a shield recharging reinforced mode and consumes stront at a constant rate unused stront will remain in the bay when the array is put back online the shield recharge comes from the diverted power of the gravitational flux capture thus any modules powered by the array will be offline until the array is back out of reinforced the array can be repaired to become active faster the rate of recharge is fairly high thus constant watch is needed to keep arrays from becoming onlinetower attempts to keep arrays onlineif the tower detects that it has sufficient shield and that an array is about to go offline it will canibalize its own shield buffer to build up a shield burst nontargetable that is sent to reactivate the array the pos is attempting to keep itself alive by keeping its arms healthy so they can continue sending shield burststower reinforcementwhen the tower is sent into reinforced the arrays also go into reinforced but as a function of the poss stront timer not their own stront bays because the array shield recharging is powered by the gravitational flux collectors the shields of the arrays will recharge even while they are under the reinforcement of the pos thus regardless of what happens during the reinforcement the arrays will be at full shield when the pos comes out and will play a very valuable role from the beginning in tower takedowns
ferry droneswelcome to pos logistics made skullnumbingly easy no more individual fueling hauling moon extract to reactors compounds to more reactors or constant involvement to keep silos from overfilling the price is that you have to keep the roaming threat tamped down but youll have more time to do itwhere do ferry drones come from belly buttonferry drones should be cheap expendable easy to deploy easy to replace easy to set up cheap easy to redeploy cheap and a complete breeze all around to work with bpos should be made available on the scale of marshmallows in a box of lucky charms materials should come from veldroidswhat can my ferry drones do for meferry drone programming should be customizable simple and capable of making the following processes almost automaticif there is fuel in a corp hanger and a tower needs fuel a drone comes to make the delievery thus a single stockpile of fuel will compeltely satiate the needs of towers in a peaceful systemif a reaction has completed or a mining cycle has finished and the product is needed elsewhere the ferry drones can ship it automaticallyfinished products can be aggregated at a single hangar arraywhat can ferry drones carryferry drones will carry anything that can be requiredproduced from a pos operation this includes all moonstuffs refines fuel and finished products once set up the server simply looks at the number of ferries available within that systems network and dispatches them to complete all userdefined hauling jobs they warp to the location with the goods take it to where it needs to go but come out of warp just a bit before reaching the bubble they can also be interdicted from the same grid using bubbles like usualhow would i program my ferry dronesive come up with a preliminary design for programming that should be farely straightforward and effective a pair of need and availability scripts that can be generated for a good you can have the job driven by either need or availability by setting a value in either respective script once you place the scripts in the proper locations with the desired values the job is registered any drones that exist in the system will attempt to complete any registered job whose conditons are met thus redeployment is a matter of buildingbuying new drones with no additional setup required
large mechanics changesjust a sweet list of things that immediately came to mind about what implications these new modules have for pos warfare and logisticsif you can figure out the pattern of ferry drones in a system you can disrupt logistics alternatively if the ferries are carrying anything valuable you can interdict their routes and scoop their lootposs can be damaged indirectly by attacking the arrays and watching the pos heal them out of reinforced as long as it has shields eventually you can trip the pos to reinforced and thereby cost the owner a lot of fuel with a medium sized gang if they wont come fight you cannot destroy a pos through arrays however because the arrays go into reinforced on a more friendly system and will always have full shield when the tower comes out of reinforced every array tries to heal the tower and the tower tries to keep all arrays onlinesince committing forces to one array of the pos too early either in defense or attack will mean the opposition can blob youjust support the tower from a different array fleet battles will become measured escalations of skirmish battles where the goal is to make as much headway as possible while keeping as many cards up your sleeveokay done now time to hit the crack pipe d
nande theres one specific problem i see and one general onespecifically if these two changes are to be completel optional im not sure how it would improve pos warfare existing 00 powers might as well continue doing what theyve been doing rather than introduce new vulnerabilities to their territory just to gain some logistics improvements essentially its all carrot no stick and runs a serious risk of just being ineffective in bringing about the desired changes because its optin onlygenerally i think theres a broader issue of whether pos warfare should be the totality of what sovereignty is ccp has said they are disappointed with the limitations that pos warfare imposes on sovereignty and in the end i think the solution theyre going to come up with is to make pos warfare part but not all of what it means to hold territory so while there are specific improvements that can be made to pos warfare thats not going to solve the overall question of improving sovereignty
this op is a good start and a major improvement on previous topic presentedshould be coupled with a general decrease in pos hit points with pos modulation arrays that bring the pos capabilities close to current values small gang fights take out modulation arrays crippling pos to about 50 functionality however adding the small fights cant take away the major engagement objective large fleet fight at pos finishes the battleon the general idea of how sovereignty is determined i think that infrastructure in this case pos should remain the major factor although the mechanic of pos deploymentdestruction can and should be streamlined
the changes brought by arrays are not effectively optional by design the benefits afforded by arrays should be balanced against a nerfed base tower that is highly reliant on arrays to reach its full potential a naked tower that eats more fuel than current towers has less hp and can only run a few guns should be a goal thus the choice to opt out and try to play blob warfare just makes the tower that much easier to reinforce exacerbating the fueling issue and in fact adding the same amount of exposure to smaller threatsone step at a time arrays are for breaking up the conflict across several grids so that a fleet battle will have less lag and rely more on mobility and tactics where winning a series of skirmishes can to an extent make up for inability to field a fleet large enough to take on the undivided enemy head on which is the only choice currently for holding onto sovthere is a broader issue of whether or not poss should encompass all aspects of sov but thats not as well agreed upon everyone hates the lagfests that happen when the defender comes out to fight everyone thinks pos warfare is pretty boring when the defender is down and out and wont show up im going straight for the most wellsupported themes big fights suck because of lag nonfights suck because theyre boring there are some accidental consequences that will accomplish what would be the goal of layered sov but what the arrays are mainly about is breaking up the conflict into smaller bites in large part to reduce lag and blobbing also so that a defender while unable to attain total victory can have measured impact on the battle and might be able to gain the upper hand through skillful whittling of an attacker to put them in striking distance the result id hope is that a big tower smash fest that used to be boring as hell because the defender knows they dont have a chance might become a series of smaller skirmishes surrounding the tower smash fest might not change the battle but would give a defender much more capability to influence the war over a series of engagements
ah that makes sense if the arrayless pos is nerfed then that could be enough incentive to use arraysi like where fahtim is going but i do think that conventional sovereignty based only on how many pos you can set up is flawed
i didnt take the space to point this out very clearly but the reasoning behind the flashy shield burst mechanism with coalescent geometric growth is actually for a very specific purposeadd one more feature to tower behavior when an array is damaged past a certain point 10 or so the tower will attempt to heal it based on the current amount of dps on it the tower is trying to keep all four arrays online thus if array 3 is taking a certain amount of dps it will require a shield burst of x points to keep it online at given time t smart toweralthough the shield burst is very potent hps to the tower when delivered in full theyre easily nullified at the very beginning stages 20 or so small targets that will take a minute or two to even get up decent size a hac or two could probably singlehandedly stop the whole process if theyre quick about itif you put a large amount of dps on a an array down to 90 shields the tower will attempt to heal it for the next ten minutes of punishment regardless of whether you keep shooting or not result is massive amounts of overhealnormally the towers hp buffer would be replaced by the shield bursts but since a hac can solo each burst if you are very crafty and have enough time you can put the tower into reinforced by sequentially getting the tower to prepare to heal your large damage spikes result is that you can do about 4x the dps against the tower by attacking the arrays suddenly your gang of 3k dps is doing a cumulative 12k on the tower this only works up to a certain point and doesnt work at all for dreads since they cant move from array to array fast enougha very midsize gang friendly way of reinforcing a towerthis has benefits for groups large and small large 00 powers have an easier way to reinforce multiple towers that requires splitting up small powers have a way of driving up the fuel billdisrupting pos operation of an alliance who has territory they want even if they cant win the fleet engagements outrighti believe this was the benefit to harassment tactics the star fraction bloc is looking forlarge 00 entities need not fret over the constant threat of tendomi reinforcement squads first of all the process can be forced to take time via the intervals of shield bursts and the maximum burst size since it takes time you should have enough forces to get your act together there are no additional timezone elements since youd be talking about a small gang if its a large gang you wouldnt repel them anyway in a peak vs offpeak situation nothing newplease comment on this mechanic i didnt throw it out there immediately because it seems a little rough still
well i was inclined to support this thread the getting an idea of the direction of the game from ccp part not the pirates want more noob bait part until ki an posted thispeople are entitled to their opinions such is life get used to itsorry now not supportedab
are you 12 years old by any chance
hiwhat if ccp enforced us to go into player corps by raising tax in npc corps for all older then 4 monthsbut at the same time limit operational time of corps to 2 months in which corp has to get at least 10 members into it if there is 9 and below members in corp after 2 months corp is closed and players are returned into npc corpswhy there is thousand of 1man corps which isnt point of having corporation and there are thousand alts in npcs corp which should find their way out of thateve is mmorpglet make it that way by playing massively in corporations not playing single player game onlineflame away
sighyou dont need to be in a multiperson corp to play the game socially chribba for example is his own one man corp and alliance and has been for years
one man corps are fine
wait chribba is a one man corpalliance wheres my ceos wardec approved stamp i mean come on hed have to hire mercenaries and really how long could any one guy hold out sooner or later his isk would dry up right
yes because lets tell people theyre not allowed to play the game socially unless we think their circle of friends is big enough the npc corp changes i can at least understandeven if i dont agree but the changes youre proposing to player corps are just dumb
you must work for ccps marketing department all this will do is get ppl to start alt accounts have them join their corp some of those accounts might stay active for longer than the 14day trialmost will let their alt accounts lapse into inactivity inactive accounts still contribute to the number of people in a corp easy work around found which means your solution is flawed
tax npc corps after 4 months no why because for some people who play the game casually and i was one of them for a long time we liked the npc corp we helped newer players figure out the game and got them to on thier roads to whereever tax the npc corps and people like azia burgee will not be around to help out new players who need the helping handhave 10 members in 2 months no why because alot of people myself included form the small corp in order to not have to be called newbs anymore and avoid being slapped around in a big corp relegated to a position of gopher some form small corps because they just want to do stuff with friends and maybe they only have three or four of them in the game at this time telling them to get 10 members in two months will merely cause grief especially if ur taxing them in the npc corps which u are now saying that they will be booted back into i have had a couple people toss out forms to join my corp but they are alts looking for a place to just hang or worse spies or scammers why would i want them for alot of people being able to make a small corp 15 people is all they want to do small corps of just ur own toon and some friends is easy to manage and usually not a target for wardecs or scammers looking to screw you over eve is designed for both coopeative play and solo play and that is what makes it so good in comparison to something like warcrack in that game you have to do the end game stuff in big groups or you dont go and for some thats not what they want i personally have played the game almost completely solo without interaction for close to 2 years before i gained the group of friend i know hang with but i created my own little 2 man corp me and my alt in order to be not a newb corper and not part of a massive overbearing group its me and i like that and i am sure lots of other 12man corps are of similar thoughtrant
wait a sec how is this fun because then people like me are forced to play the game your way im in a 1man corp and always will be im social enough to satisfy myself and occasionally chat with others that makes me social but i dont jet out in the vast emptiness of space just so i can be annoyed by the corp tab in my chat window i head out there to explore and be alone most of the timesure id be more than happy to find my way into a large corp like you suggest if you also give me the ability to completely hide the chat window no blinky no bottomrow tab no nothin then we can both have our cake and eat it tooor heres another idea invite me into your corp
why not
yes  but try it on the test server obviouslyedit its beyond me why every week there isnt a different game mechanic test on the test server
no dumb idea ccp should focus on new aspects of the game instead of adhering to whiners on the fourmstaymees
not needed leave them alone
maybe im misreading my original post but i think i stated that their speed should be boosted in an age where speed is about to get sunk making them much harder to catch they still get a 2 minute bubble but its greatly diminished in size if they want a maximum range effect they can keep a 20km bubble up but its going to require frequient drops over 2 minute span rather than 1 dropkeep in mind its likely webs are gonna get nuked also so a speedy small ship will soon be very hard to kill as intended add to this shields that can hit upwards of 3k if fit with extenders and a speed plus small shield buffer becomes a very effective shipi think part of the problem with the people in this thread is they hear a change and refuse to consider all the current and future factors that are going to come into game playid really like dictors to keep the 810kmsecond speeds that would keep them usable are they still going to suck in lag sure but what ship doesnt already bare in mind the speed is a bit lower than currently achievable bc the command ship bonus will likely be gone soonhonestly this proposal goes well with the current nano nerf when you consider that fleets will be given more maneuverability if and until a perma bubble or heavy dictor gets on a gate
posting to show this is a bad idea
from another forum but i want it herethe dictor still keeps the 20km bubble per the post its only losing the duration of said bubble so that its not a lingering effect if the ship is popped the 5km bubble holds the duration so 2x launchers could be very effective at throwing down 2 5km bubbles id rather a dictor have more speed less guns and be responsible more for dropping bubbles than replacing the frigatethe point of it is to remove a single ships ability to tackle large portions of fleet this allows more flyby attempts wo making them impossible to counter this is a very quick path to reducing the amount of people needed for fleet warfare and thus reducing blob mechanics the better more skilled fleet flyby becomes an alternative againolder bob members and their competition should remember the 50 man flyby fleets causing havoc on triple their numbers this would bring back this tactic to an extent but with more reprocussions since dictors are in game keep in mind dictors were added to game bc of flyby fleets in and out of grid constantly but their so good at their job its enhanced blobbing bc the fleet are held down way to easy now a daysi dunno maybe make the bubble 20 second duration but 2 minutes is a joke for that size bubble
crap idea raising issues to compensate for your inadequacies ftw
i live in 00 i like living in 00 the plentiful bounteous rats the highend minerals the cap ships and dictor bubbles and nano blobs and alliance politics  i love it all there is in fact really only one thing i dont like about living la vida lowsecthe darn randomcharacter system namesi understand the reasons for it  there are so many of them its just not practical for the devs to name them all but i think it would be really cool if people could propose names for the systems they frequent on a firstcome firstserved basis the rules would be as follows1 to propose a name for a system you must be in that system2 the name must be under a certain length whatever the current system name field length is presumably3 the name must not be obsceneoffensive pass it through the forum censor or whatever before accepting it4 the name must be uniquethis could be automated and itd be neat for those of us with explorer tendencies to get out there and really name the stars plus it would add a whole lot of color to those dry and boring 00 system names 
ane end up with another etherium reach hell no
nooband what happened with etherium reachnoob
just change the numbers in either syllables or lettersfrom leet speak and add vowels to the results until you can pronounce them no need to use a complicated process of people proposing names reviewing them and applying them thatd only result in cheese and idiocy really
after all of the bugs have been killed you can do this
isnt naming your station enough
yes im sure that we wouldnt have 500 systems in eve named after  stars or phalluss
its plenty
bad idea ccp will have to police innapropriate names all the time sometimes you wont get the meaning but some part of the players willbest to not even allow station renaming
you mean we will not see names like p3n1s
a slight improvement in many stats and abilities would be much better then boosting one ability over the top to get this ship to workand only boosting one abilitystat really ruins the versatility of the ship overall by making it so that you must use the boosted stat or be gimped an overall general boost to cpu pg sig radius of the ship and its drones or any combination of the ideas presented all over the forums would open up different fitting options and make the ship viable and versatile
look at my thread please and then tell me what you thinkpersonally i think that they need to give both the force recons and the hacs a considerable kick in the ass boost until they have a shot at going up against and killing battlecruisers so that the price and training time for them is actually warranted
i like the pilgrim but the in web range is somewhat unnerving without a drone bonus and adding a range bonus to neutnos it would allow the pilgrim to deal more damage as its using heavy drones but have less variety as it only has a 150m3 drone bay it allows the pilgrim to use sentries meaning it can ewar damage and cap warfare a target at range i think it would change pilgrim setups so im not exactly sure of the idea
not all of us think that heavy drones are such a good idea what with them being slower and more easily targeted and knocked out
while the pilgrim isnt great at the moment i suggest you give it a try after ea 11 while its problems stem from its lack of range postpatch web range is no longer guaranteed death and the pilgrim has a cap warfare advantage as well as the tracking advantage it might not be enough but it will almost certainly have more use following the speed and web nerfwait and see is the order of the day
i think that most pilgrim pilots are quite concerned anyway what with the ship having limited damage the tracking disruptors and their bonus being of very contestable use and things like the recent cutting of 200 armor from the ship which is meant as an armor tank and thus already has a rather inferior shield all of these points are very hard to get around even after the patch so while the cap warfare bonus might be considerable if the ship cant bring down the opposition that its scaled for that just makes it all the more pathetic and irritating to its pilots
basically as it stands the marauders generally combine bonuses of the top tier battleships to make one machine that can deal tons of damage and tank god apocs recently have been changed to integrate the cap bonus in favor of an optimal range boost and the paladin should get the same bonus why the golem has a range bonus in the form of velocity the vargur has a range bonus in the form of a falloff bonus the kronos is a blaster boat so range isnt exactly a huge concern why should the paladin be able to hit ratsenemies with higher damage ammo at similar ranges like the golem and vargur can granting the same bonus to the paladin gives it a megapulse range of about 30km with multifrequency crystals this would make life much more fun for ratting as crystal switching for kiting rats wouldnt be a huge issue anymoretldrapoc gets a range bonus and integrated cap bonuspaladin has the cap bonus as a throwback to the old apocpaladin should get range bonus like 2 of the 3 other marauders
i agree
this really makes sense if you think about it
down and up
hell yeah dude this is overdue
paladins need to get auras like in diablo 2 and a smite ability and some of those flying hammers
well that means at bs 5 which you need to have you get 50 more range which means with my tachys my optimal would be 525km i dont know about anyone else but id pull a pocket and only start shooting when they got within 40km  the range of my tractors i wouldnt need the extra rangebut if they become viable for pvp then yes this is a good thing
give it falloff bonus and itll be great counterwhinealso paladin has 4 guns when compared to apoc which as you know has 8 which doubles cap usage
i dont see what the problem is with the paladin i dont want to engage stuff so far away i have to slowboat out to get itcurrently i can hit with scorch l out to 72km with my paladin and an onerios which is more than sufficient to pull aggrothey will definately need a buff to web function with the upcoming nano adjustment though
no way with hammer of justice and divine intervention the paladin is already totally overpowered i dont see the need to buff it any further blizzard should focus on classes that really are underpowered like the priest or druid
this thread got to be a joke right right
this is ed why on earth would you boost the best marauder definite no to this nonsense suggestion
hey have one actually  all the web effectiveness bonuses have been increased to 10 so a t2 web 60 would actually web for 80
tarminic cant count lols60x1590
seriously why would you want to boost a paladin204540 combat your tachyon beam laser ii perfectly strikes sansha overlord wrecking for 39499 damagethe thing is an engine of destruction and is perfect the way it is i can hit to 50km with my tach iis but i never end up engaging over 40km because of the tractor bonusso really buffing it at all would lead to the paladin being used in pvp and the consequent whining about how overpowered it is
you are correct maths has not been my strong point of late
since you cannot fly against an asteroid in the game and lose the ship that wayfraud insurrance the selfdestruct isk must remain edit failtype
supported
i support this
you are perpetuating a stereotype of your alliancewindjammer
oh agree mucho
this idea makes sense
woops posted new topic by mistake
ok so i thought if this like just a few miniuts ago fyi i have desliesik and i dont have good spelling so if you feel need to re right this for me plz domy idea for a new option onto the gtc is to have a pause or freeze button this means that if people go on holiday or go on a business trip for a long time they wont loose any money or game time because they can just freeze or pause there game time to me this idea will help the customers alot and we really need this or something like this since gtcs are really expensive now i dnt want any whiners in here just say i agree or say what you think should be done to help the idea dnt whine people are sick and tide of whines now so if you go to whine just gtfo thnx for reading i have load more on spot ideas but never posted em because of all whines and my bad spelling loleditposted with my alt by mestake sorry my real charater is eliminator2 carnt wait till i get ride of my alts yay lol
i do think this idea has been trolled through in the past its not gonna work
step 1 buy gtcstep 2 train skill step 3 pause until skill is complete step 4 reactivatestep 5 repeat steps 24 step 6 sell ludicrously overlevelled character for billions of isk not signed
pause  skills pause too i guess
whats this a trendif you dont like it you come to whine to forums about it and hope ccp will fix itinsert random roleplaying rambling about ship sizes here
its like theres a ccpmade forum for game change proposals that he posted it on as for the idea i dont much care either way
well that explains how ubar this idea isif you want the item bid for it sniping sucks balls
sniper options and general auction improvements yup sounds like a plan
could the csms bug ccp about getting the economic letter out more frequently
you mean the quarterly that is soon to be 3 issues behindi guess we can just start refering to it as the annual economic news letterbtw somewhere on these forums cant find the link but lavista did actually report that while in iceland he had spoken to dre who was sorry for the delay and is reportedly working on it
yup  if ccp is paying him for a quarterly economic newsletter we should get it at least approximately quarterly soontm is annoying enough with nifty new features but with the really cool stuff like mmo economic analysis its just not right   not sarcasm ive given serious thought to doing a masters thesis on the topic
my hulk is fit with the following couldnt resist3x mod strip2x hardener1x pithib small booster1x domi sba1x damige control1x pee dee es2x cccnote it would be fit with more awesome stuff if i wasnt poor and it can tank good against angels and really crappy against sanshabut some spawns tankable
ducttape fix
um what problem does this address again
to opjust get into a 00 corp and get all the excitement you wish let other players do as they wish theres so many reasons what you suggest is wrong that its daunting even to start writing about itproposing to change the game just to suit your imaginary needs and expectations is beyond comment im afraid
forcing people who want to make a buck into gankspace will never and has never re exodus expansion  monumentally failed attempt to push the playerbase to 04 work or workedpeople want to be reasonably confident they can enjoy their game experience without the fear of being attacked without forwarning or reason thats why 75 of the playerbase resides on 20 of the mapcan they make good money you betcha but thats their choice in how to make that money people who exist solely in 00 make money too and a heck of a lot more of it its only lowsec that has problems because it cannot be claimed and held there is no concordpolice presence and its essentially one huge freeforall areaone caveat though faction warfare has made previously difficult to survive regions of lowsec almost safe for neutrals by driving off the less cautious pirates
introduce a new tier of npccorps one that can be wardecced for a large sumimpose a tax on players in the old npccorps based on their time spent thereso when a new character is created heshe will automatically be instated in a classic tier 1 npccorp first two weeks there will be no taxes over a period of time say three months taxes will increase until it reaches 50 when the pilot leaves the tier 1 npccorp for either a player driven corp or a tier 2 npccorp heshe can never return to the tier 1 npccorp when a player leaves a player driven corp it will always be to a tier 2 npc corp unless the pilot has moved to another player driven corpwhen the pilot arrives to the tier 2 npccorp heshe will be immune to any current wardec against that corp for 3 days or at least some form of limited time in order to not be kicked straight into a conflict these three days will not reset if the pilot transfers to another corporation and then back again during this period to stop it from being abused this immunity should not be repeatable for at least seven dayspossibly the fwmilitia could be classed as a tier 2 npccorp since they are at a constant war there could also be tier 2 npccorps that are involved in fw to various degrees adding an industrial aspect of fwalternatively there could be a possibility to purchase a letter of marque against a pilot who is protected by the temporal immunity given by the tier 2 npccorp but only during the period when said pilot is protected by the temporal immunity
if you want to make it like real life insurance just do this1 you pay for insurance2 they use the money to find legal ways not to pay your claim3 they draw out any court claim to the maximum possible timeframe or until you cry uncle and go home lessthanemptyhanded4 they win you losesimple lets make insurance a way for stupid people to lose their moneyalso lets make it mandatory like irl
i hate hearing caldari pilots cry that the amarr might have a better hac than they do i do not hear them complain about there drake being far more powerful than any amarr bc the point is that different races have different strengths some race is going to have a ship that just is better or is easier to make a good build than the other races per class i am sorry to the caldari that the amarr get hacs the sac is not better than the cerb it just is used differently however how its use just happens to be more useful in most engagements
this idea doesnt have an eve feel to it so im not supporting it if it goes through the only way for it to work is to let it become totally optional mute music or everyone gets free kill rights on lousy musicians
1 character per account is a bit too drastic i think some people prefer to pay for only one account and use remaining slots to train basic low sp alts such as hauler alts alts can also be trained on another account and then transfered to the main characters accounta better solution would be to add a tab under character information in game that would list two other characters on the same account it will not remove alt scouts but it will allow people to check who they belong to and it does resolve alt posting issue
what about the people who have 3x 60m sp characters on 1 accountthere are a lot of directors and ceos like this and veterans
i have 3 characters used on this account 1 indy and research character 1 market charater and 1 pvp main stupid idea stfu just because you have 2 other characters that only have 900000 sp doesnt mean everyone is like you most of us actually use the other 2 slots for something productivetaymees
terrible idea alts are half of what makes this game fun also with the free trial you wouldnt be killing alts youd just be killing alts that could last a useful period youd be building scouting alts by the thousand to no purpose and your rationale is entirely about cutting off your nose to spite your face which im also against
when i read this i hear people whining whining people complaining about people that are whining how ironic i remember the first poster of this tropic catching me in my heron afk scanning in a 04 mamouna system wasting a very expensif set of implants my own fault but what the hell im not whining where else u got mercs for

we are working on larger issues in terms of actual size and reachthough im working on smaller issues too a number of them even also the submission date is not for another week so there is still plenty of time
interesting is there a place where you announced what those larger issues are and i can read up on them at the moment it kinda looks as if you just do your thing and to hell with the rest of the players more positive publicity might be a good idea for the csm
well i can only speak for myself right now i dont have much to showbeen on holiday the last week so have really not had time but look out for it on the market discussion forum i will be posting much more about it there

i am wondering is why is this thread still active in here i meen what the heck are the forum mods doingthis isnt even worthy of consideration and despite my feelings towards the csm itself i have to wonder how much hipocrisy runs around these forums and this playerbaseyeh jade used some stronger words in a forum wow big deal call in the un comitee  get a grip people if i was in some of ccps staff shoes i would have been more worried about gs declarations of ruining eve and the unacceptable proliferation of mindless alts and sort of characters around here in fact jade may not be perfect but at the very very least he has appeared in most threads defending csm  agendas and sht cast aside  while most of the representatives didnt even bother or only appeared to help and degradade the csm image by atacking its chairmani can just point the gs member directly atacking jade and nothing has been done geee how wonderfull ccp
yes and numerous people have been testing on sisi and have stated that the nerfs are too much and as bad as they sound on paper
yep as soon as nozh gets his information from those players that are testing it and hopefully make some adjustments then we can bring up an issue with the csm as to the specific issues we would like them to reconsiderit makes it much easier to address specific issues that they plan after the sisi patch testing then trying to bum rush the devs with out even knowing where they are in the process you would only have to create one draft and a very poniente draft of proposal than guessing on half of it on what they plan to introduce to tq or nottldrpresent a clear and focused issue to the csm on the confirmed changes to be intoduced to tq after the sisi testing
posting in a i thought he was talking about the things on his ass from sitting too long in front of his computer thread
what if one could clone jump once every 12 hours1 boost fw participation as smaller corps that reside in 00 sec could jump clone to empire to partake2 station camping would be less effective3 managing pos in distant systems would be more manageable4 picking up the groceries from jita would be less of a hassle5 frequency of logon traps could sky rocket6 traders would become more versatilei have heard this idea mentioned before and thought it might be worth a few more wordsrelated topicissue 23h jump cloning edit  subject related topicflame on
i think it would be better if there was a 24hr stasis period on the to and rather than the from end in other words you can jump to a clone once that clone has been in stasis for 24hrs this would allow a player to hit all of their jcs in 24hrs and would give players who have trained up infomorph and have installed more clones the ability to jump more frequentlyany time period less that 24 hours would probably have some detrimental timezone effect or whatnot thats complex and someone will soon point out
hey maybe if i post my idea in this forum rather than the assembly hall people will pay more attention to it
we dont have a channel at all they put up the sisi testing thread great i believe there has been one fairly short response from nozh and thats it they arent reading it there were some serious and good posts about experiences on the new patch on sisi however it devolved into arguing pretty quicki dont really think they give a crap what we think they only pander to the pve noob whiners now because thats where the money is
lol
compared to realworld democracy the scale representation ratio and hours expected of csms is really not unreasonable they dont get paid except in the form of a working vacation but thats not wholly unprecedented either i look at school board trustees here in ontario for example toronto a city of about 25 million people has a public school board with just under 300000 students a budget of over 2 billion and its represented by 22 trustees who until recently made 5000 per year thats not much above the cost of two trips to iceland and they have a far higher representation ratio far more of a workload and some big realmoney campaign costs toronto is an extreme example and most boards arent that insanely underrepresented but its still a bigger burden than the csm with a whole lot more responsibility on top of that and these positions are still contested probably 80 of the time all over the province i agree we shouldnt expect them to fly around the world buying us each a nice bottle of 35year scotchthough ill gladly promise my vote to anyone who does but a lot of criticisms can be reasonable
thank you for your insightful response i hoped that despite the obviously sarcastic tone and content of my post this might be a place for a discussion based around such points

bounty hunters and mercenaries  a visionthe csm has recently decided to try and work out a few big picture ideas i chose to focus on the hired guns in eve bounty hunters and mercenaries it is currently not really possible to be a bounty hunter in eve due to the flawed bounty system mercenaries are more common but still have a lot of room for improvementthis plan aims to solve the issues around these two professionsplan nil mortifi sine lucre a 6 page pdf file detailing the plans if you do not have a pdf reader i suggest installing foxit readerfor the tldr crowd ill try to give a short explanation of the plans however do not criticize this plan without reading the full versionbounty hunterbounties will change into bounty contractsplayers with the bounty hunter skill can accept these contractscontracts can only be issues on players you have a kill right onbounty hunters who have accepted the contract gain a derived kill right on the target allowing them to attack the target anywherebounty payouts will be proportionate to the approximate value of the damage inflicted on the targetmercenarymercenary corporations can issue mercenary contracts with their feescorporations involved in a concord sanctioned war can accept the merc contracts but only if that corporation did not start the waronce accepted the mercenary force enters the existing concord war dec on the side of their employerpayment of the mercenaries is fully automated
i would welcome any comments or suggestions on this plan 
sounds interesting and definitely worth looking into
i endorse this product andor service
i see a couple problems first by making it impossible to accept contracts of over 2 million at first youre essentially freezing out most veterans flying across half the galaxy finding the guy killing him and podding him is worth a lot more than 2 million of my time anyone who is really gungho about the idea of being a bounty hunter will probably choose to endure it but its a roadblock thats not necessarily bad but it should be noted second why shouldnt attackers be able to use mercs ive done wardecpiracy before and its not unusual to attack a corp smaller than yourself and have them hire mercs rather than paying up in that case we should have the option of hiring our own mercs to keep the pressure on rather than being effectively forced to fold because they hired a corp twice our size besides if attackers cant hire mercs youll still have a business in forumbased merc services but the results wont be tracked and all the fancy payment options will have to be humanadministered also another similar problem  payment for kills shouldnt care who was the aggressor i care about kills not who gets the drop on who all that aside however this is one of the best proposals of substance ive read on this forum to date and im happy to support it
i agree with herschel and this is an excellent proposal
this is a problem i also identified and its a part of the plan that can still use polishing at first my plan was to allow bhs to accept any contracts but that greatly increases the risk of someone claiming their own bounty by killing themselves and having that as a real possibility will be a reason for many people not to use bounties at all since they dont want to end up paying the person they want to get revenge on another good point and one we did consider we chose to limit it to victims of a war dec to avoid a mercenary arms race where each side hires more and more mercenaries this also makes it easier for smaller corps or industrial corps to fight pvp corps by using their money we also hope this restriction places a realisation of risk that currently does not existing in empire wars the attacking corp would know they might get mercs on their ass without being able to counter that directly as for the payment the payment in its current form doesnt care who was the aggressor as you point out correctly only the kill matters not who fired the first shot did i phrase it unclear
i like the ideas
i realize this would need a lot of work but what about an npc bounty corp bounties would continue as they are but anyone wanting to choose this as a career could join said corp and as long as there is a bounty be immune from being concorded
have a skill for it that does seem to be the eve default solution to problems after all less grind more train and its easy enough to have people not want to collect their own contracts  figure out a market value of the damageafter insurance and pay the bh half of that you can collect your own contract but its at best a way to liquidate assets for half their value not many people will do that thing is if youre going to have a mercenary arms race youre going to have a mercenary arms race  most people wont shy away from hiring mercs just because they have to go looking on the forums for themor looking through open merc offers and evemailing the ceos involved for that matter this just seems like youre setting up the bewildered why havent they fixed this yet threads of a year from now if youre going to fix the interface you might as well fix the interface for everybody heres how you phrased it its the as the aggressor bit that im questioning use a phrasing like whenever a mercenary kills a concordsanctioned enemy a prearranged in the contract sum will be withdrawn from the corporate wallet of the corporation that has hired the mercenaries also as i read that one other minor thing comes to mind  if multiple corps are on the kill have the kill rewards be prorated by kill sharedamage dealt or ships count whichever its probably assumed but it should be in the final version since a lot of merc corps fly with their patrons or with other mercs if multiple corps are hired
both are wonderful thoughts i definitely agree that mercs should be limited to the aggressed to prevent escalation on tangential note i think giving empire wardecs some sort of meaningfulill leave what that constitutes to others end state could help address that problem regardless of that merc contracts sound goodbounties otoh seem subject to the major issue which you point out targets claiming their own bounty or having it claimed by someone with relations to the target the issue of it being claimed through self destruct isnt a major one simply make that a nonpossibility similar to no insurance when you get concordokken in order to prevent fradulent claims on the bounty for lack of a better term a bid system could work licensed hunters may bid on contracts the issuing party may then accept the contract in the event of multiple bounties on an identical individual some sort of corroboration system could be put in place where the hunter with the majority of confidence from issuing parties receives the full contract something along these lines still leaves room for parties with ties to the contracted individual to gain the contract but that could be resolved partially through leaving names out of the contract noting only known ship types flown and other information on the target in the contract itself
yesthis
thats exactly what i was thinking if the payout is only a fraction of the damage inflicted theres no incentive to cash in your own bounty
a few good points raisedin reply to mercs only being able to be hired by the defenders in a war the defender is having to pay large costs to hire mercs in the first place so by declaring war on a smaller corp and forcing them to hire mercs you are inflicting economic damage to them by allowing one side to hire mercs it makes wars between corps a little more interesting dont you thinkbounty hunters and contracts this is possibly the biggest hurdle to overcome in terms of selfcollection or should i say altcollection of a bounty a bounty system should not be a source of income for players that get themselves bountied or their corp mates etc by having bounty hunting as a viable career and limiting contracts intitially to them remember as they gain standing with the ird they get access to better contracts this stops players selfcollecting another idea floating about might be to prevent the bounty amount showing on the bountied player only bountyhunters see what x bounty is on x playerno system is going to be completely foolproof however these proposals are frankly many times better than the current systemstake carearithron
signed i dont see why you need this limit a mercenary arms race sounds like a lot of fun to meand as herschel said if you only give the defeners the option you force attackers to use forums to hire merc which again will undermine the function you try to implement
a merc arms race benefits the aggressor more than the defender in many circumstances it also places small corps at a distinct disadvantage when a large corp war decs them and as others have stated do it for some wardec pirating in empire wars should be serious business and the act of declaring war should entail some substantial risks currently imo it doesnt especially when a large corp decs a smaller corpthe idea was also to make merc hire valid with concord ignoring interested parties etc only by going through the ird automated payments etc would be available through this department hiring mercs outside of the system would be possible as currently they are but the rub is that its via the war dec system thus the hired merc corp outside of the ird declares war on defending corpthe defending corp can then hire mercs etctake carearithron
question though why particularly a skill and not a corporate mission or a taken profession or to make things simple and less mechanicinducing just something you accept through a contracti think these changes look great its just that im curious as to why it would be a skill and what skill levels would affect and what the requisites would be
are you referring to bounty hunters or mercsdefending corpsthe idea behind bounty hunters having the skill is that it can easily be referenced by code for access to bounty hunter contracts etc essentially the ird acts as an interface for contracts as for why mercs via the ird ease and simplicity for a wardecced corp to find and quickly acquire the services of a merc corp or two again the ird would be just an interface for contractshope this clears that up take carearithron
i endorse this development and look forward to trying it out if it passes the bar so to speak
well yeah theyd have to launch their own wardec but is that really a problem youre describing the status quo and sure the defenders could bring in mercs through the ird but they already can do that  if the attacker is hiring mercs then the corp defending the merc wardec is the same corp defending the original wardec and can hire mercs accordingly its easier to just encompass an entire conflict be it with however many corps into a single wardec because thats fundamentally what it is get rid of all the bureaucracy not just half of it and im not sure why you think wars dont entail risk ive got a fair bit of experience with aggressive wars and the vast majority of marks in my experience tell you to go pound sand  either they spend 5x your requested payoff on a merc force twice your size and average character age or they hide in station and take a week off people have a pathological aversion to just paying the guy with the gun pointed at themcf verones sig and as such wardeccing for bounties is usually a waste of effort it makes good sense if youre doing it as an attack on your opposing alliances supply lines or if youre settling a legitimate grudge but the idea that its a riskfree profit source is crazy
i agree that most wars entail risk dont get me wrong i did give the example of a large corp deccing a much smaller corp especially in empire these sort of wars might not pose much risk for the large corp at all the ideas for mercs are just those ideas nothing is set in stone indeed ccp if this gets that far will prolly adjust and change some of the proposals beyond recognitionhowever the current merc system is ad hoc and no easily reachable and instantly available system exists for many corps who might have zero experience in pvp let alone wars especially in empire a system that makes wars and allows for the easy hire of mercs and a system that makes it easier for merc corps to make isk and act as true merc corps cant be bad can ittake carearithron
yeah you can push around guys a fraction of your size but you wont earn enough to be bothered with theyll either bulk up to size with mercenaries in which case theyre not really smaller huddle in station in which case you get nothing or pay you a ransom thats barely worth your time effort and risk and besides most pvpers like the action as much as the cash and theres not much chance of that either risk is basically proportional to reward especially in pvptype activities and besides its not like youre banning the attacker from using mercs youre just making them fight with the old interface to do so if youre going to do a ui upgradewhich is ultimately what this is since theres basically no new functionality here then do it for everybody dont pick and choose and im not saying that its set in stone or that its bad i just claim that it could be better and thus im trying to fix what i consider to be a fairly obvious problem while i see it rather than assuming the person after me will catch and fix it i still like this idea quite a lot im just a nitpicker at heart

man great idea and stated simply too
i agree with this to an extenthowever along with that riskreward thing other changes need to be mademissions in low sec and 00 should pay way more than they currently do meaning we dont need to grind all day making up lost time from station camps or roaming gangs im not talking about bounties or loot drops either the mission rewards ans bounses need major buffs also changes need to be made to the cloaklogoffski timer or all of this is for naught since currently with these screwed up game mechanics ratting or mission running in low sec or 00 is not risky at all given you know how to exploit like the farmers do
i disagreewhy do some eveplayers feel the need to force other eveplayers into lowsec or nullseci do some l3 and l4 missions not to many but a few if i am bored with other stuff to force me to go to lowsec or nullsec to do those would cost me way to much as gatecamps is present and any ship fitted for missions cant hold their own against a ship fitted for pvp let alone a gatecamp of pvpers the skill and isk involved in getting a big enough ship to handle l4s will make a juicy target for any gatecamp more so then the small frigate i say let the missions remain in the locations they are now but remove any agent mission that are against any of the other races from the normal mission table and put them in the fw mission table
well maybe its will be a bit hard to mission with exactly these changes but lvl4s shouldnt be in highsec for sure i think moving lvl4 agents to lowsec would be enough i support this idea
if you have crap spawns in 00 you better of making missions in empie balanced absolutly notminerals are another story no oen cares to mine them they just refine t1 modules from loot moving lvl 4 to low sec will fix modules flooding market for refineveldscord in emprie space rest go low sec00
supporting this idea
whilst i agree that this is a problem i dont think that simply moving the agents is what one might call an ideal solution i might voice my support for moving all agents with a 5 base quality to low sec from lvl 1 to lvl 5how all lvl 3 and 4 missions is ed
100 support a change like this would do so much for the game compared to where it stands now
meh i find this a bit drastic i am a casual player and changes like these would drive me away from the game im afraid
i dont entirely agree but i do think that at the very least all lvl4 agents should be moved to low sec i remember ccp talking about doing it ages ago but it never materialized
fixed for you
my penchant for running high sec level 4s when im bored is exceeded by my hatred of rmt farmers farming with impunitysupported

thats the problem ccp is catering to people like you who rarely play the game the players who actually play the game for what its worth are getting screwed by people who farm without consequence

funny since usually the problem is ccp tunes all of its stuff to people who play large amount and tends to ignore the rather sizable community of 510 hourweek playereve is actually pretty attractive for the casual players esp with the skill system its a game where someone who plays 5 hoursweek or less can still be active in a corp of hardcore people and still be usefulbut scaling things to the hardcore group has always been kinda annoying well just replace your implants it only takes a day or two of ratting when it take a casual player over a monthcasual players generally dont want risk free but our risk table looks a lot different then a hardcore gamer since it takes so much longer to get any loss back not to mention longer to get something in the first placein another one of these treads someone was commening how impossible the game would be if everyone only got one mission per day many players already live with that and we do fine
a month to replace implants 4s take an hour of level 4 missions at mostand really podding doesnt happen all that often especially ij empire
poast
a month for the settrue a single l4 can potentially pay for a single implant but that is if you run l4 missions
what is thisgoons posting and then having the rest of them support any goon post should be automatically ignored by the rest of the eve community no matter what it isremember they play the game only to ruin it for the rest of the eve community so obviously anything they say is only meant to ruin it for the rest
this 00 is taken low sec is pirate controlled you cant jump a bs in a system without being ganked on the gate scanned out or ganked on the next gate
100 supportto address a few concerns1 insider trading  this is easily policed by an efficient market as long as you can easily access trade history on any corp youre in good shape by watching trading volumes and investigating any spikes in activity you actually encourage the dissemination of information volume spikes  interest  possibilities  eg small corps trading volume spikes people investigate learn rumors of admittance to large powerful alliance enemies begin to interfere with possible alliance while shorting shares 2 please dont limit access to the capital market  let any corp sell shares their value nav should reflect their lack of history or small size etc but permit the penny stock market to develop as well as its high riskreward adn would permit high rep players starting new corps to raise capital quickly3 fraud  scams  ultimately should be buyer beware however to encourage reliance on markets there should be some form of transparency via createondemand report function so that the market can look at the books of the corp at any time as a second line of defense there should be options for ceos to commit to certain things that cannot be changed later  eg 6 month commitment to 1 dividend or 3 month commitment to no sales of assets or 6 month commitment to no share dilution or 6 month commitment to no sale of debt or 6 month commitment to no acquisitions of assets in excess of 20 present corp value etca robust public share market would add a substantial minigame to eve  corporate raiding takeovers mergers it would add financial markets professions  eg ratings companies financial commentors consulting firms and it would be a new way to invest your isk for profit and to raise isk if your a corp with the rep and means to do so
fully supportedi have always wanted and done a little in stock purchases and ipos but i would prefer some more solid ingame tools to support it before spending much isk on it
sounds like a fine idea of course it would be a cold day in hell before id release any shares in a corp i was running but pvp corps are different
i propose the introduction of slash commands in eve these wont be a major change in gameplay but just make it a bit easier for us to play the game instead of opening your people and places window searching for a solar system and rightclicking the result to set your auto pilot you could simply type destination jita in a chat windowexamplesstarting a conversation with another playerconvo player nameopening the market details of a specific itemmarket item nameset your auto pilot destinationdestination solar system namedisplay the information window of anything in eve itemsplayerssolar systemsetcinfo nameim sure we can come up with more slash commands this is not any sort of revolutionary idea just a small improvement that i think will make eve a lot easier to use for experienced players
naturally i support this 
this would be awesome one amendment though  market name should perform a search on name and only display it if theres exactly one match also market quickbar and market browse should be special commands to jump to the respective windowsi doubt many would use them but they dont interfere with the search so we might as well give the option
i wholeheartedly support this
i completely support this
an excellent idea as long as it is tightly controlledi dont think we need an emotehappy eve universebut a few quick commands would be nicei support this idea
well we already have me which is enough for emotes these commands are intended to be functional rather than emotes
for practical stuff like you write i think this is a great idea it would make life a lot easier for me too and im not an experienced player starting convos and looking up market details would be very nice

not a damn reason this shouldnt be implemented

i think a gm already said somewhere dunno were it was a while ago that they cant implement slash commands because the chat interface is not connected to the game thing decision running stuff sorry i cant remember how he called it and it was like this to prevent abusingcheatinghacking natural i support such an idea wold be interesting but a bit useless in lag fests
hate to say but this is exactly correct the chat is just an irc network run by the eve servers that is why you can notice the chat time and the game times will be different
thankyou everyone for the positive feedback is there anything anyone would add or change i think more feedback and discussino would be helpful before poking a csm to add it to the agenda for the next meeting
i only see one mistake and thats that you want a minus not a plus herei also have two suggestions one all these new rigs should try to emphasize use of the crap salvage components as much as is practical we dont want more of them that use up melted cap consoles and alloyed trit bars give us some with charred micros and contaminated lorentz two for the rigs that do absolute things100 cap need for warp 2 jump harmonics etc make sure the t2 versions still exist  they should use significantly less calibration than the t1 or give bonuses to other things as wellcovert jump bridge fuel use etc but eliminating t2 is lame so give them a reason to exist when you cant just increase the bonus 5 other than that i like it quite a lot get poking
yeah id like to see more variety in rigs or at least more point to fitting a specialised one over a vanilla rigpart of the problem i think is that you cant change rigs without blowing them up therefore if you want to change to a different type of setup on the same ship you have to stick to the same rigs so people tend to stick to the generic ones that help all setups but if like you said a more specialised rig gave a significant advantage over a generic one then it would be worth fittingthe other thing i think that maybe needs to be addressed is where the penalties lay some of them are ok like more grid use for weapon rigs that makes sense and you have to fiddle with your setup to make sure the guns fit if you use them but stuff like polycarbs affecting your armour oh noes my armour on my lsetanked ship whatever will i do maybe something more relevant should be penalised such as agility or increased mwd cap use something like that that would actually hurt the nanosetup and maybe make the pilot think twice before automatically polycarbing everythingps the optimal range rig stacking bug needs to be fixed already
great ideas
i agree rigs could be a lot more specialized id like to see them add things to your ship you generally cant get via modules right now theyre just extra module slots especially with the ccc ones and stuff
awesome

absolutley yes
i was thinking about this some more what is so special about the speed tank that it needs to get singled out as some bastard stepchildthink about this what if turning on your armour repairer or hardener made your lasers go dead is that a stupid idea its as bad as this one speed is just another way of mitigating or avoiding damage like a conventional tank sure it has some secondary advantages such as staying at the range you want or being able to disengage from a bad fight but your battleship has plenty of ways to do that too like deaggroing and dockingjumping through a gate getting rr help etc
interestingly enough it does if you cant sustain your capacitor v0v
whats special about it is you cant beat it by pressing f1f8 and singing lolololol the way every carebear fw achura whiner wants to thats why it needed nerfing honestlyedit im not bitter about this honestly
looks like a good solution to me or at least better than ccps solutionelegant way of making the change too would require minimal time something that should be looked into
sounds very good would not totally break speed and change about a hundred other game mechanics
i might be a new character but this is a good idea
i like this idea
all truth has been spoken by the op this is simple elegant effective most everyone can live with it it wont destroy the game ccp will never listen and ramrod fullsteam ahead into nerfoblivion all checkedtherefore this gets my seal of approvalcheck
1not really an mwd user here but even i dont agree with their complete oblirteration by ccps ideasnot just for the ab boost i support this
once again sarmaul comes throughas a vaga pilot i totally support this god forbid a fight should require more thought than orbit f1f2 f3 etc
againstthis still kills most of the other hacs
wow something that actually makes sense
yes
eugh
fixed your post
it of course needs more thought and perhaps some tinkering but i agree with the overall concept supported
i like it the only thing that comes to mind is maybe some mitigation of the fitting on absmwds if you use the mwd to close and still wantneed an ab for effective fighting the 25 whered my cap go from the mwd along with the fitting requirements of a decent ab are going to be a bit steepremove the 25 capacitor nerfadjust the fitting requirements of mwds and abs maybe they give a sympathetic fitting reduction to each other when fitted to the same ship but obviously cannot be used at the same timescripting a single module may be a bettermore elegant solution though abmwd script or something
marvelousas was pointed out to me rather well though fitting two speed modules like that will be hard on most ships and make for huge trouble with interceptors thus it might be better to keep the cap penalty and a high energy cost and not make abs stack instead making the microwarp simply less powerful than it is now 200250 speed increase perhaps
awesome idea way way better than ccps idea change a few mods instead of all the ones they are doing less coding and would be altogether better

seems much more reasonable and a better compromise over the current sisi changes
i approve as well a nicely thought out change
very good idea

while i agree with the problem i think the remedy is the wrong one there are several reasons1 00 attractivenessincome in 00 moon mining excluded is not much higher if at all than l4 mission running in highsec when you take everything into account if you remove local what youll probably be doing is increasing the loss rate for people ratting in 00 this means that itll be even less profitable and youll see even more 00 players earn their money in highsec this is not desirable2 who benefits from localit is true that the ratter including the cloaking macroraven benefits from local but so does the hunter ive been on roaming gangs in 00 where weve run through 20 systems without seeing anyone imagine if instead of local youd now have to scan every single system meticulously im not at all sure the ratters are the ones benefiting most from local3 scanning mechanics for prey and hunterwe all need to make money and those who rat for it knows how boring it is imagine that youre ratting for a day to make a couple 100m isk and you have to press scan every 5 seconds doing l4s in empire looks pretty good compared to that ehh for the hunter it is much easier as he only have to do it maybe 34 times per system then move on imbalancedso what is the real problemthe problem is not that the infamous cloaking raven can see that youre in local the problem is that he can easily escape from you when he knows that he can either cloak or logoffski whichll effectively protect him from the huntersthus i think the solution to the cloaking raven is not a local nerf but a combination of these note that this might actually make it too easy to kill a ratter testing requireda cloaks require somewhat bulky fuel ships specifically designed for cloaking have the fuel need reduced covert ops cloaks doesnt require fuelb cloaking activates the aggression timer covops cloak excludedc npc killing activates a reduced aggression timer 5 minutesd aggression timers carry over through session changese reduction of l4 highsec mission pay not removal to lowsec

yes if theyre going to mail you notice of insurance expiry the least they can do is mail it when said insurance expires if thats too much checking have them go out over downtime  your insurance will expire at 3 pm today and to the two above me if you want to support check the support box when typing your post
i agree ive only noticed i get the expired insurence mail when i insure another ship or as you say open the insurence tabwe should get the notification at the moment the insurence expires or as someone else mentioned within the 24hrs period of it expiring by sending the mail out at dt

i guess putting support in the original post doesnt count obviously i like this
what i mean by this simply is if you have 8 guns on a battleship for instance allow people to drag and drop them onto the same turret button so that by pressing that button all 8 guns fireim of the opinion that you could then code it so that rather than 8 guns doing 100 damage each and the server mechanics of that you have 1 gun doing 800 damagehopefully this will reduce lagsometimes you dont want to do volly damage i realize so ofc this would have to be optional
and if one gun wrecks all wreckfor example
how about what i say in post 53 about t1 ships only getting a bonus  any comments on that 
i approve this ideaat the moment you only get the ship is out of control and plenty of dead modules in those brief halfseconds before lag catches up and you end up in a podyaays ideas make titan combat more tactically viable at the moment if a dd instakills someone theyll jumpclone back to the nearest station and potentially be back in the fight in 30 seconds with yaays ideas youd be crippling ships for at least 30 seconds and giving your own friendly fleet more to shoot at cmon who else is jealous that their titan pilots account for most kills on your kb combat is prolonged and it gives the victims of the dd at least some chance to surviveyay would your idea consider scripts one script to do as you describe and another to put the full 71k damage or even more should it be required at a single target
at a single locked target i think a script for damage could be viable i would say 250k damage with a rof every hour if it were focused a thanatos with 75 resist and 180k armor would take what 7 to 8 of these before dieing full shields to pod
i agree ccp should look into an idea like thistitans should be able to do some pretty neat things in return for the colossal investment placed in them not only in the ship itself but the blueprints skills materials and posinfrastructre needed but simply being able to deploy a chuck norris smartbomb is not that smartyaays ideas all sound feasible and preferablealso an additional brainfart here  does anyone have any thoughts on how to incentivise i may just have invented a word there titans to be fitted with their class of weaponry all the titans have some sort of bonuses towards their relevant xl turretslaunchers and yet there is no situation i can envisage where you would actually want to fit them or use on a titan in preference to a sieged dread at least
titans need two nerfs to fix them1 no doomday ablity in cyno jammed system  cyno jammers grid grid would be better2 1 doomday per hours per grid
having fought with and against the largest collections of active titans in eve since they were introduced into the game im convinced that when either side is sufficiently competent they make bugger all differencethe last titan nerfs were enough imo they removed their previous invincibility and forced them to put themselves in danger to dd all goodthe only thing that id say needs to be nerfed with regard to titans is their alignment time base is very high however as most of us know with the right mods you can reduce it to the extent that you can warp in dd then warp out just as it goes off this is in my eyes the only unbalanced aspect of titans left actually i tell a lie the amount of lag generated by firing a dd and generating so many wrecksmails simultaneously really needs to be sorted outdds are easy to buffer tank with regular fleet fittings easy to avoid easy to see coming with the addition of hics they are also in serious danger of dying every time theyre wielded against a significant foein my experience theyre actually pretty balanced and dont make much difference in day to day combat even when theyre in system though naturally this also has something to do with the fear many titan pilots suffer from to the extent that you never even see half the titans in eve going anywhere near a fight furthermore the combination of dds and cyno jammers that people endlessly whine about is really a nonissue they change little unless youre trying to use a woefully inadequate force against umpteen titans and support and have a braindead fc in which case its right that you should get annihilated
the main problem with doomsdays and their deployment and effectiveness andor lack there of is lag if you doomsday someone and those effects take place with lag theres no idea telling where you stand when the effects have really endedalso currently a doomsday is avoidable see the titan on grid warp outhave a titan spotter dedicated however with lag as it is by the time you actually see the titan on grid youve been dead like 15 minutes solution for titan dd would be to probably extend the time by which it can fire its dd again giving multiple waves of battleships a chance against multiple titans 5 titans bring 7 waves of bs  heeheh
i read the topic and thought geese another noob not nowing wat there on about actually read it and though wow best idea thought out for the ddgreat idea luved it 
role bonus 99 cpu use for siege module itd also give them a good 20000 more dps tanked for when theyre actually standing and fighting if youre feeling crazy you can also let them receive incoming logistics while sieged  its powerful but itll actually let them live against a dread blob
sieged titans its an idea  but the status quo is currently that you fit smartbombs and with good reason  hordes of fighters and tacklers swarming you have a good deal to worry about which they would not if the titan did not have smarties fitted  simply allowing a dread siege module to be fitted would a use up a valuable high slot and b not produce any significant damage that the alliance fielding the titan could not provide by fielding an additional two dreads at a fraction of the cost  therefore im not entirely convinced allowing titans to siege like a dread would lead to titans being fitted with xl class weaponryhowever thats not to say that the notion of a titanspecific siege module like dreads carriers and rorquals have their own type of siege module is not without merit  perhaps there could be some way to tie a titanspecific siege module in with yaays original idea
i like your thinking
i support this idea
remove plain vanilla t1 from loot tables  yes pleaseremove t1 meta items from loot  no thanks
i support meta items could be done from special components and bpc drops from ratsinvention cnr shouldnt bring more minerlas than hulk l4 is now more profitable than most 00 region rats

mission loots not 00 rats loots
proposal give each ship a hard cap to its maximum speed regardless of what modules or implants may be in play leave modules and implants as they arethe goal reduce nanoship speeds so they arent going into plaid i wont go into the justification for this it seems pointless as ccp has determined there is a problem that needs fixing how the goal is achieved is quite another matterdownside of current ccp ideas for reducing nano speeds they are too widespread and radical the ideas would affect ships that under current conditions do not reach speeds considered nano these ships are using the current rigs and modules for agility and yes speed but not nano speed millions and billions of isk in modules rigs and implants will be rendered impotent if all the proposed changes occurupsides of my proposal1 nano ship speeds are eliminated2 modules rigs and implants are not nerfed this allows them to remain effective for other purposes such as agility3 a smaller mix of the afformentioned modules rigs and implants can be used to achieve the hard cap max speed this would leave slots available to be used for a greater variety of abilities and thus increase variation within eveimplementation i would suggest ccp use the chart theyve already constructed see the dev blog
putting in the thumb for support
good concept but need a better idea than the above maintenance arrays in player alliance outposts in 00 are also subject to these rules the pirate factions agreed to this i do appreciate the attempt at ingame rationale but this just isnt sufficient the idea itself is pretty solid just cant support it personally
not nerfing snake implants down to half30 is senselesshowever nerfing overdrives one of the poor noobs only sources for speed boost which is a reasonably balanced module is at the same time senselessall nano structures should either have a massive stacking penalty or not stack at all seriously hydrocarb rigs should be restricted to one for every ship too you only have one damn ship structure and one damn housing for an engine and even if your ship is multiengine if it didnt affect all engines at once logically the whole ship would need rebalancing and we would be talking entirely new levels of customizationstill the basic idea of a hard speed cap has been mentioned and given a reasonable excuse and i supported that idea as i will the fundamental target of this ideahowever i stress that i think a few things have to be toned down and some others left alone still the proposed changes both in the dev blog and by loads of people here on the forums are way too large and simplistic
so would you be opposed to leaving the status quo in place but having the drones come back under your control when you get back on grid with them it wouldnt help people who logoffski but itd save those of us with bad power grids from having to watch several million of hammerhead iis getting calmly blown up as i slowboat 50 km to try to get them back
id support that absolutely i actually think its dumb that it doesnt work like that now
i think as a compromise they could just stop rats shooting your drones once the player has ewarped due to disconnectpvp you know you probably expect to lose a few drones and if that is from a server problem well it doesnt make that much differencebut npc rats killing your drones if you drop connection and wiping out your profit for the next x amount of spawns that just feels vindictive
id go for npcs deaggressing your drones and them auto reconnecting to your ship when you reconnect and warp back inthat seems not sploitable for pvp purposes the drones are still there so players can shoot them while solving the basic problem of losing drones because of stuff outside of your control
youre also not commanding your ship to warp out under emergency warp out protocol but it still happens if you fly away after a fight leaving your drones thats abandonment however in that case its an act you have a choice in in an emergency warp out you dont have a choiceif a ship has its drones out its usually fighting if a ship can warp away from a fight why would it perform the logoffski the emergency warp out doesnt work if the ship is scrambled or do i have something wrong herepersonally i have what most consider to be a pretty good isp one of the major cable companies our service still occasionally goes down many other people do not have as nice a service as i do and i know they suffer from connectivity issues not much you can do about such things there are only so many service providers in any one area and all of them go out sometimewhile its not always ccps fault we both know that sometimes their servers crash though less than they used tothe point is disconnects happen that are real and not just logoffskis logoffskis are a problem but i dont see them being exploited by having this feature of drone retrieval implementedwindjammer
if this can be implemented in clean fashion im for it
its actually because the tractor beams can only lock onto your particular signature of dust and space  they simply slide ineffectually over someone elses wrecks its just a matter of physics im afraid
its 00 theres no law there every wreck is my wreck
today 00 tomorrow everywherei mean come on people if you need to keep the jetcan aggro flag fine but lets at least play tugowar with the wrecks when someone loots the can shoot them
im liking thisi mean technically wrecks dont belong to the player that blew the ship up anyway  the wreck is the remains of a ship bought and paid for by the unfortunate pilot be he player or npc so even if any claims to ownership of a wreck should be applied it should be to the person who paid for the wrecks constituent parts not the person who destroyed the shipsupported
dont go warping it now i dont care if there are built in restrictions in regulated space but 00 why
dunno why tracktor works on one junk and dont work on anotheranother idea would be that you could tow other ships to you considering mass and beam strenght 
i think you misunderstood the point i was trying to make  i supported the thread because i think any tractor beam should be able to tractor any wreck its activated on  everything else i said was simply trying perhaps rather clumsily to explain why i think that is the caseedits and kalintos itll never happen but the tractoring ships idea could lead to some hilarity hotdrop rorquals with capital tractor beams pulling snipe bs out of position anyone hahaha

let us pull anything including other peoples ships
the trouble is that 25 people really shouldnt be threatening a space empire in the first place  the taking of space shouldnt be easy it shoulnt be quick for a small gang and it shouldnt allow a bunch of nanohacs to run around and have a chance of actually mattering in the grand scheme of things if youre willing to commit a large number of bses or dreads to the line then you should be able to do some damage if not then you should be harassing but not on a level where you can do damage to the infrastructureyou really shouldnt tailor nerfs to reducing lag youre gonna have to end up fighting at a pos at some point  its unavoidable by bumping the sov requirements you avoid the need for a jammer takedown at all  simply conquer and hold one or more of the outpost systems in the constellation for a week and the jammer becomes just another offline object in space
this is why we need territory control to be based on layers dreads and bs fleets would be needed to dig deep and root out heavy infrastructure like pos but part of what it means to control territory should also be based on light infrastructure that smaller groups are meant to attack and that changes hands more fluidlythe current system is entirely binary  you are either fielding dread fleets and sieging pos to impact sovereignty or you arent impacting it at all what sovereignty needs is a more gradual progression from minor impact all the way up to the big impact of dreads taking out pos and the level of defender benefit a territory holder has should be based on how well they are defending their territory from the minor impact stuff all the way up to pos warfare
some pretty terrible ideas and premises thereespecially that youre basing proposed changes around server performanceby that logic it would make sense to introduce a system cap of 100 people which would of course be ridiculed
technological limitations can and should be considered when devising a game mechanic the economist is just wrong
then i propose a system cap of 100 sharding of the server and the removal of dronesflippant retort aside obviously new content should take into account the limitations of the server however existing content should not be altered solely on that consideration there needs to also be justification in terms of game mechanics while there may be some aspects of the game related to sov poss etc that could use tweaking i dont believe the op hit the nail on the head with his premises his approach towards them or his proposed changes
disagree completely realism and believability withing the context of the eve universe should be much more important letting game design be dictated by technical limitations leads to artificial game mechanics
the reinforcement timer is an artificial game mechanic and far more unbelievable within the context ot the eve universe than anything in the op
first i am glad you identified a reasonable number second thats your opinion and again threatening isnt the right word as i keep saying affecting and taking part is the concept you are only threatening the space when the defender fails to show up or is too busy or cant actually maintain the space neither should the defending of space be easy and you shouldnt expect lagtedium to be on the defenders side i thought some of your collegues were suggestion that roaming gangs already have a part in the grand scheme of things and if you are incaping and disrupting station services and moonresearchindustrial operations by reinforcing towers you harrassing not destroying or damaging anything if they are such small gangs then they really shouldnt be a problem then would they i am sorry but that statement is inexcusable and totally ridiculous everything should be done to maximize gameplay and to ensure the integrety of the game for all players and not allow game mechanics that favor a few to dictate the quality of the eve cluster for everyone else current sov mechanics are in direct conflict with the ability of the cluster to handle the demands of players which are just following the rules given this isnt a nerf this is an adjustment to let people actually play the game in more conditions than are currently availible
true but a bad analogy this was implemented due to a realworld limitation not a technical one also strontium does exist in the eve universe this doesnt mean i think reinforcing is the best way to conquer the timezone difference rather im simply saying it is an acceptable compromise until a better system is found define better i would only support a new mechanic if it moved further away from artificial on the ingame realism scale which i have not seen in any propoasal that is based upon server processing or bandwidth limitationsin that category this proposal is pretty good part 3 though  for what ingame reason must a cyno jammer be located so far from the pos
let them support posts rake up i say 
if you dont like being war decced you can always join a corp that cant be wardeced caldari provisions springs to mind
seeing if i understand thisso basically watered down attacking the arrays effectively hurts the recharge rate of the pos it is in the pos best interest to keep these other structures alive by sacrificing shield recharge because when those structures go down the pos is even further gimpedonce all the outer structures are incapacitated the pos can focus all of its shield recharge on itself but has severely limited capabilities all in all this makes small special forces groups tactically viable but still allows a strong fleet to defend the pos at the main control towernow giving my support as it allows small gangs to beat the recharge rate and reinforce a tower given enough time it should take a long time to kill a pos this way  a realistic alternative to a bs fleet pounding the shields as is currently the only option but should still be a viable optionedit removed support after further discussion and new problems
it may be but imo anything else so far presented is too artificial pos count is a concrete simple system of determining power and ownership this new pos reinforcing system makes pos count more legitimate as a determining factor by adding multiple tactics of military pos removal which1 makes it possible for more groups to counter poses that claim sovereignty but 2 still allows controlling entities to counter with active defense of the installation
as with most sovereignty proposals ive seen im not at all sure that the proposed details are optimal but i like the thought process here especially arrays they do very interesting things
good idea if done right it cant hurt only help
this sounds like it could workmaybe ccp could impliment something that the player gets to decide how much percentage is income from say missions and rats or whatever would go towards a real charities that they pick charities that are a world organization not something that is only local to one specific country per say like a cure for cancer or somethingbut if we are trading in isk and ccp has to pay for that how would that work the isk could be used to sell gtc but then who from ccp would be online spamming to sell them or whateveraside from that whatever effort that is needed to make this happen would be well worth itcould you imagine as far as i know nothing like this has ever been done wouldnt it be great if eve online was the first to do thisin a game where nothing truely matters now it can
couldnt agree more
what a stupid proposal why would you want to penalize people for actually playing the game the way ccp intended it they are in pc corporations and they are part of the gamewhat you really want more war targets and make them easier to spot come on get a grip on yourself eve is mmorpg and people can play how they want to play it they do not need some turdbrained 15 year olds to tell them how to play this game no one forces you please do not force others either
3 man minimum and you can still run them solo
1  ccp has stated they will not force people out of npc corps deal with iti take it that 10 is the magic number at which you feel its viable to wardec that corporation it takes 3 maybe 4 trial accounts to fill that roster 3  1 alt on the main account works best so they can hop to another during wardecs by leaving an alt as ceoccp is not going to force a minimum size on corps or force players out of the npc corps they want to cater to the most playstyles they can keeps them in business
you read it right upon removing confirmed macro accounts refund sec status lost by players that suicidegank and report themgive us incentive to help boot macros out of the game by making it fun if not profitable
upon activation of a mining module at irregular periods 515 minutes send the mining client a simple mathematical or symbolic question that a 5th grader could complete but no macro program could answer correctly assuming nothing is done to increase the interactivity of mining itselfanything irregular to disrupt the operation of macro programsafter two or three failures caused by afk or macro mining the pilot becomes a global criminal and can be attacked by pilots
errr no if someone wants to semi afk mine thats his choice no need to make them global criminal for it
supported as a test on sisi
yes its never ever benefited me ever i like one way streets theyre easier to walk against you know its a fun game when people hide behind alts on this forum
cornfield this thread
heres an idea ive been throwing around a bit lately and thought id bring it up in here since its not really a traditional conceptany changes made to the game be it game mechanics changes additions subtractions whatever should be explained away through storytelling existing story andor roleplay advancement etc for example the current issue of the nanonerf whatever the outcome there should be some kind of reporting done by scope to explain what happened such as manufacturing corporations are finding it exceedingly costly to continue to make these components and blah blah blah rather than seeing some news on the log in page pointing to the forums or whatever you get the ideamy reasoning behind this is that when i log in and play no matter what im doing ingame im in the game im in eve and i want to stay in game the entire time im playing i dont want to be sucked back into reality this is my escape from realitylets discuss
seeing how the drone regions panned out hell nofor renaming systems check out this thread name systems corporate tool
i like the idea but the devil is really in the details on this one you want the names to be inoffensive nonabusive pronounceable relatively static and playercontrolled that is not a trivial combination ill support this in principle to see if anyone can come up with an actual system but frankly it probably cant be made to work usefully
most of the complaints stem from the idea that the pilgrim has to go into web range to attackfollowing the speed nerf web range is no longer death any cruiser sized vessel can outtrack battleship turrets and many cruiser turrets on sisi with moderate ease a boat that can approach using a covert ops cloak can use an afterburner which makes that damage avoidance even better a boat that can tracking disrupt can do that even better once getting under your opponents tracking your only threats are neuts missiles and drones the pilgrim has never been good at attacking missile boats and has a cap warfare advantage so being neuted is less of a problem hint if you think you are going to face heavy neuts and you have a massive nos bonus then nos work almost as good as prenosnerf if it can tank 5 unbonused drones long enough to kill 13 of them  with its 5 lowslots it can be an effective solo prowler againmy advice is give it some minor hp boosts as its the tankiest recon and leave as it is postpatch it will be relatively boosted in quite a significant way
trust me from considerable sisi testing tracking disruptors are not debatable in their use  they are in fact freaking nice especially within web range i also think limited damage is a bit rich thats rubbish  it has the same bonus and drone damage as both its t1 combatcruiser ancestor and the curse its combat recon counterpart neither the falcon arazu or rapier gets that damage i quite agree on the loss of armor which makes no sense and im not saying the pilgrim will be balanced post patch but i think it will get a relative boost from the speed changes and thus boosting it further is stupid until we see how useful it is on tq afterwardsi reread your op and i like the idea that force recons should cater towards the sneaky gameplay and i like the fact that the speed nerf means we can get towards that again despite having to give up my nano ships hopefully that plus blackops boost will be very positive as a change for sneaky guerilla warfare as opposed to speedy guerillai dont think that taking away the other force recons range bonus would make them better  it would be a huge kick in the teeth the pilgrim makes sense as a close range boat the others do not theyrenot bastard children  they nice ships that just dont work as well speedy so are not popular today the pilgrim seems readymade for these changes and if its still inferior then it needs hptank buffs not other changes
that analogy is complete fail think for a second how do you determine if a learning skill is worth training well if you plan to play eve indefinitely then all of them are worth training to level 5 period if you only plan to play eve for a month or so and then quit then theyre not worth it at all so what learning skills end up doing is making people decide how long they want to play the game from the very beginning before theyve even gotten a chance to see if they like it and they certainly wont be liking it much after spending so long training learning skills how does forcing people into a decision like that helpful it just adds stress which is what people play games to avoid
fail justfailyoure not specializing by choosing which learning skills to get youre gimping yourself by not getting them all specializing implies that youre choosing between things that are mutually exclusive that is not the case with learning skills consider one person who goes for learning skills and another who goes for gunnery skills the one that gets their learning skills up will be able to go for gunnery skills after finishing and will eventually end up with more gunnery skills than the person who neglected learning on top of that the person who neglected learning will never be able to catch up how is that specialization the person who went for learning ended up getting more of everything the fact is that if you plan to play for long enough all the learning skills are worth getting there are no cons to getting learning skills from the perspective of someone who wants to get maximum skill points the cons for learning skills to the average player however are that its boring to train them and you have to play the game for a really long time before they pay off so you make a game where the best decision is to do nothing for the first few monthswhat kind of game is that its flatout stupid to make a game and then encourage players to not play the game
see thats the fallacy you do have to do them you have to choose between having fun and having a good character if i want to play eve for a while and have a good character i should train all my learning skills to level 5 from the start if i want to have fun i should train up my ship and gunnery skills so i can go blow up some pirates youre telling new players that if they want to have fun they should quit eve fairly soon because theyll end up being left in the dust because they didnt train learning
but theyre not like any other skill training in eve thats why theres so much controversy train gunnery and you have an advantage train learning and you have a learning and gunnery advantage the only time learning isnt the best decision is when you plan to quit soon and want to get one particular skill or set of skills by a certain date that means that in order to decide whether learning skills are a good idea you have to decide when youre going to quit eve why is forcing people to set their quitting date a good thing what does it add to the game for someone who wants to decide whether they like eve it just discourages them and makes them likely to give up they can train some combat skills and have fun but they end up being penalized for it since they didnt spend that time training learning skills why are you penalizing new players for trying the game out
edited quote to save space sorryi appoligize for the misquote i never actually knew where it came from only that many have said it when making statements about the first amendment so i jumped to the conclusion that it was an american sayingas for the rest yes he is asking for special treatment this is the internet and a video game as close to being a public forum as one can get only teathered by the rules set forth by ccp you are going to get jerks and idiots alot of them joke around with thier friends and such using terms that someone else may find offensive to ask them to stop simply because you are offended is asking for special treatment in an example if i find the color blue offensive does it mean that i have the right to demand no one be allowed to wear blue when around me no i simply must learn to live with it or avoid it the responsibility falls on me not the rest of the world by asking the rest of the world to conform to my views i am indeed asking for special treatment in this case it is similiar his views and opinions differ from others so he is asking the others to conform to his opinions or views even more so to simply not be allowed to express any opinions or views that may clash with his that in my opinion is asking for special treatmenti have learned long ago that it is not possible to change the opinions or ideals of others that it is something they must do for themselves if i do not wish to hear them then it is my responsibility to ensure i do not this is what it all boils down to responsibility for yourself rather than accept it people try to place it on others people like that have the mindset of if i do not wish to hear you then i will stand here and not allow you to speak thereby making you responsible for what i hearalso i would like to take this oppertunity to point out that by stating that he hates bigots by deffinition makes him what he claims to hate not exactly ironic but that is the only word that comes to mind at 2amedited realised i logged in the wrong character sorry
im confused jade is being criticized for advancing his agenda shock horror surprise yet two goon csms arent being criticized for not aggressively advancing their agendas squeaky wheel gets the oil etcisnt the job of the csm to advocate their position maybe the posters in this thread should be demanding the csms who represent their positions to push for their agendasi guess you could keep deriding people who are obviously dedicated to seeing their vision realized instead of fighting for your positions then whine after its too late to block changes you dont like  like youre doing now
youre missing a key point in some of these issues the status quo is the desired outcome by some delegates the opinion that nothing needs to be changed in that particular area and arguing against new ideas that they disagree with is fighting for your positionalso are we going to see other 00 proposals from more delegates
if you have in mind an idea you like just post it in the assembly hall on a nongoonswarm alt jade will make sure it gets on the agenda

edit i forgot the subject mmm i dont know if this is the correct place but i would like to give an opinionremote clone jump destructioooooooooon pleeeeease seriously think about it it make sense you are able to speak with your agents when you are far away from them for example when you ask for a mission then you move away from that station and try to accept it the agent will say awsome come to me and blablablaand by the way we got spaceships and we dont got a phone riiinghellohi destroy my clone i dont need it anymoremore seriously you could access at your data via web or something and manage your account so you can even destroy your clone if you wisha very long post for such a simple thing just to try and give it a logical explanation p for the backstory or rpg or call it as you wish you got it 
remote destruction of ones own jump clones sure would be nicei cant think of any rp conflicts or potential exploits of it that would make such a change a negativei guess a thumbs up from me
i have actually wished to be able to do this for some time now instead of the flying across new eden to be rid of a clone now useless
i read the tldr version and it sounds great except that i agree with herschelattackers should have the options to hire mercs as otherwise they will just go to the forums if youre going to fix half the deal with mercs fix the whole thing
i fully support this exept the limitations both sides should be able to have fun and recruit mercenaries and let it escalate 
actually it can be quite a problem corp a declares war on corp bcorp b hires mercenary corp cnow a is fighting both b and c in the same war if a wants to even the score by hiring mercs as well  corp d  the mercs will have to declare war on both corps b and c if they want to be able to shoot both parties shooting at their client this can get costly especially if youre dealing with alliancesi guess i still prefer limiting merc hiring to the aggressed because i see it as a way for a corp that cant fight their own wars to even the scales an even balance means the success of the war will come down to player skill rather than who can hire the most mercenaries
as i said youre describing the status quo its not a real limitation for that matter just have corp d dec corp b and presume that theyll extend cs contract to cover d as for wars coming down to who can hire the most mercenaries youve got a solution hunting for a problem remember the old clausewitzian dictum  war is the continuation of politics by other means you dont fight wars for the sake of fighting wars you fight them to achieve aims so for example when bloodmoney decced a small corp last fall and they hired a merc force with a significantly bigger active strength than we had we didnt go out to oneup them and we sure as hell didnt pool our assets and get mc on the line we werent fighting to win we were fighting to make a profit hiring mercs to beat back theirs is viscerally satisfying but its lethal to the bottom line if a war is really snowballing that badly theres probably a reason for it and your interface should not stand in the way
nice idea too complex i think to be implimented but good luck
these ideas are bad eve is supposed to be a sandbox game but these ideas essentially say that you cant build the sandcastle that high as it violates sandcastle construction rule 35f if we start making these rules and mechanics eve will eventually turn into something else lets keep the sandbox a sandbox
whats complex about it you hire a bounty hunter they go out and kill the target and get payed based on how much of a loss they inflict thats pretty much all there is to it all the other stuff is just there to automate things and make sure thats what happens
this is what ive been waiting 5 years for ever since the first day the servers went live when i signed upbring it
i see some obstacles to making the bountyhunter payment completely automated if your bounty hunter blows up the targets ship and destroys a bunch of factionofficer modules how would the system appraise those one opposition was that the proposed system discourages sandboxing so to that effect id suggest more optionsthe option to set a flat reward for each ship class destroyedthe option to set a percentage reward for net losses inflicted to the targetthe option to set a cap on the possible rewardsthe option to contract a bounty hunter even if you dont have kill rightsthe contract info should show whether the target is expected to be in 00 sec lowsec or empire
estimating the approximate isk value of the damage sustained by the target is probably the most complex part of the bounty hunter idea im sure ccp can think of a good way to do this thoughas for setting a contract when you dont have kill rights this could be a problem unless the contract then does not yield a derived kill right this is necessary because wed be creating kill rights out of thin air otherwise a bounty contract without kill right will be a lot harder to fulfill by a bounty hunter though
i think it would be fun if you could issue nonsanctioned or black market bounty contracts that do not grant kill rights and that do not require kill rights to createim talking about putting a hit out on somebodythe formula for deriving the payout received would include not only he approximate isk value of the damage sustained by the target but also the approximate isk value of the damage sustained by the assassin in accomplishing the kill where damage includes some monetary value attached to sec status lossthis is basically a game mechanic for hiring people to perform suicide assassinations or at least assassinations that will result in a large sec status loss and guaranteeing their compensation if they succeed
tomanwatch out for the issue post re pirates hitpersons and other illegal activitiesthe purpose of this particular thread bh and mercs is to add depth to legal concordsanctioned activities take carearithron
ya thats the idea you dont need kill rights for the bounty hunter to be able to do their job especially if the target is in lowsec or 00 sec but theyd need to see that on the contract its just a prosandboxing thing
cant be arsed to read the 6 page file as its not worth it to be that detailed but its been pretty clear for a looong time that bounty hunting needs work and something similar to what you outlined has been suggested many timesmerc corps work pretty good as it is
its about time all noob pvpers goes of of this game and the ones with balls is allowed back who actually dear too pick a fight and stay in the fight instead of running around like a chicken  take the speed  away and all you pvpers who dont like it buhu get back into highsec then and do your lvl 4 missons p

glad to see that ccp still dont know what a blob is 
as in every single goon with no exception shares this same opinion of game breaking seriously link proof id love to see it meanwhile read the latest eon  we got a feature isnt that cool
trolling muchbut in all seriousness maybe remove all high quality above 0 mission givers from high sec through them in lowsec shrug maybe buff station guns to further discourage station camping in lowsec and make there be more mission givers in 00 it would be awesome if alliances could put mission givers in their stations  like tvn
aweful punctuation brillient idea
i do think that the mission system needs to be rebalanced i dont think this is the correct way to go about iti think its important that it should still be possible to access level 4 missions in hisec however the rewards loot and salvage should be reducedidealy i would like to see mission rewards scaled down with the popularity of an agent more popular less reward this has the added bonus of boosting the less popular mining type missions and dealing with the overcrowded mission hubs
signed but put some non high ql level 4 missions in lowsec as well
better idea make all 00 into empire 0507 make all lowsec into empire 0809 and make all empire 10this is about as reasonable as the ops ideabunch of petty children
so im gallente and i am doing faction missions frequently i get slaves as loot off amarr slave trader ships sadly if i take them home to my hangar i will lose faction as they are considered contraband in gallente space that makes sensebut my alternative is to leave them in space or kill them outright this is just sadim sure the gallente government doesnt really intend for their contraband rules to cause the death of innocent slaves but im sure im not alone in leaving those poor folks to starve out there in the cold expanses of space locked for the rest of their miserable lives in a cargo containerso give us the ability to uncontraband them turn them into freed slaves or something let them live i know its a small thing and there are probably bigger issues out there but this keeps bothering me

oh man thats awesome
no im all for making things easier but this idea will just make ccp put off improving the user interface with a ui overhaul there is no need for things like thisat a push id have a run window pop up on a bound button with a couple of dropdown boxes that you can tab between ie bring it up hit m for the first dropdown to select market tab s to select search tab then start typingeven less work than your slash commands and far far neater slash commands are a very hackish way of doing things

seriously ccp why would you rather implement your rediculous changes and subsequently rebalance nearly the entire game tracking exp velocity etc taking a lot more time than you would by little tweaks here and there time that would be better spent looking at real issues like sov warfare or i dunno lag
1 for this idea
i think this is a viable alternative to revamping the game specialy since ccp still hasnt repaired the damage to the arazu and lachesis with their last big nerf
this seems like a reasonable idea that would be interesting to test out on sisii still think the web nerfscram boost is a nifty idea as well though and could add more interesting combat mechanics
elegant and simple good alternative to current ccp proposed changessupported

wow simple and elegant
i had to scroll down to find this upppp
supported the main thing that would need balancing is how much of a boost abs get if they simply got a 50 boost around the board id be happy i think because then its still possible to do 1k in a completely tanked out hac which basically combines normal tanking with somewhat of a speed tank youve got your normal sig bs sized turretsmissiles have a hard time trackinghitting a tanked target orbiting at 115k you are just as vulnerable to neuting and you get that 25 cap that youve been playing without for years now no you cant make it back to a gate so its not for solo but in actual 30 man nano gangs it gives hacs some sort of survivability brings them back to their gankntank roots while also opening up many new possibilities for both the nano gang and those killing it
its a lot simpler and easier to assess than ccps far reaching proposals whilst there will always be issues regarding any nerf this seems to reduce the number of possible gripes worth a test and i support this alternate solution

makes sense
no sarms idea forces as many changes as ccps just fiddle with polys speed multiplier stacking on implants in conjunction with a couple of mods and a couple of ship slot amountsthen stop theretheres no need to continue to go down ccps route of making huge changes to fix a relatively small problem the issue is speed multiplied without thought not the total balance of combat tanking range and bonuses we do just fine excepting certain shipsimplantsyoure overthinking the issue stop acting like ccp
i for one give this a hell yeah
agreed needs some tweaking
please visit your user settings to reenable imagesthis changes two modules and results in a rebalance of speed and striking power while leaving the utility of ships as the currently exist intactccp made the tempest heavier than the raven among other acts of lunacy how can you possibly compare this idea to the drunkwithaweedwhacker approach currently enshrined on sisi
well in my experience eve voice has better quality better security and better usability than vent or ts the only downside to me is the ctd vulnerabilityif we could click a popout button once it was running to seed a separate client i could see no reason to use a third party app other than bloodymindedness or maybe a logon trapbring it onill
awesome
its kills me to admit ccp is capable of doing anything right these days but ive been using eve voice in small gangs since it came out and its miles ahead of ventts for quality security and convenience in those circumstances the only downside is that if you lose connection with the server you also lose comms people often have issues setting eve voice up initially but once its done everyone i know has sworn by it
i think this riskreward for hisec level 4 missions is out of balance this has resulted in mission hubs becoming overcrowded and prone to lag making the eve experience less enjoyablei dont think the solution suggested by the op is 100 correct but i agree something needs to be doneim more in favour of dynamically scaling down the rewardsloot for missions depending on the popularity of an agent more popular less reward this would in effect make agents obey the laws of supply and demand
it would also give a huge incentive for mission corps to compete and fight with each other
ya would be nice
i support this to the fullest extent
i totally agree with this i mean i have switched out of a warring corp myself due to logistics or diplomatic reasons regarding the main corp but using it as war tactics to evade and counter is an exploit this is a bit too drastic seeing as the same mechanic works for corps leaving alainces at war where they engage a 24 hour end period during which they are still at war this could be implemented towards characters doing so it would be as with corps a surrendering act by the player
agreed ask to get this bumped to a senior gm as the gm youve been in contact with is incorrect this is an exploit by the very definition of the word that ccp uses
there was a thread on the ideas forum about some lag reduction techniquesif the server is falling south of some metric for responsiveness it aggregates certain actions if you have seven turrets for instance it creates one with averaged stats have to prevent abuses like putting in a small turret to boost tracking speed and uses that average turret insteadon average its the same for big fleet battles yes it would help a bit maybealso had the idea of giving server priority to ships based on their speed class fast ships need to know where they are and need to see whats happening with a lot of granularity a dread needs to play stacking games with the stront in his cargo bay
i would be for this idea if it were a selectable option if you could right click a turret and select synchronise all turrets so they all fire at once that would be benefitial to players in addition as mentioned if the server treats synchronised weapons as one big weapon it should reduce server load generated by turrets where its needed most fleet battleshowever youre going to need to provide more info on the mathematics behind combining 8 guns into one for this idea to be viable remember that each gun has a separate tracking speed chance to hit signature resolution etc on top of the random factor in its damage its not all about just rate of fire and damage and you cant just take an average of all the stats
the best part that i like about this is that it has a sandbox element a group of pilots can decide to specialize individually flying t2 ships or specialize together in t1 shipsi would say if a fleet is comprised of 875 t1 ships of one race the bonus of that race is applied to all ships of the dominant race this allows one or two oddball ships once fleet size gets large enough 78 but any gang below 8 members must be all one race this cutoff can be tweaked very easily by making the percentage  n1n jade
i actually really like this idea in some form i do agree with the notions proposed by objectors about preserving the sandbox aspect but it really bugs me that fielding a fleet composed of a single races ships is not currently recommendedim sure something could be worked out that gave just enough of a nudge to get some people to do it id rather see some homogeneous fleets than none at all barring the likes of cva
thats the most important point it must be stressed when it is proposed that it is more of an incentive than an advantage
i support the further discussion of this idea by ccp and the csm it may not end up working out but its an intriguing concept that just might add a ton of value to the gamei quoted the above because i support this idea with those caveats in mind
now this is much more agreeable to me personally and it answers many of the objections im hearing in this thread
subversionso does this mean that jade has agreed to immediately step down and face reelection that was one of his promises immediately after election that if ccp approved it at the iceland meeting he would step down as chair to reelection
approving ideas gob
well to put it simply xl weaponry isnt very good an erebus fitted with 6 blasters and 7 gn magstabs does 2286 dps which is less than double a gank battleship for 1000x the cost the only reason anyone uses xl guns in any context is the siege module thus you need either the siege module itself or a functional equivalent now if you want to have a titan siege module with no tracking penalty and no bar on logistics or something of that nature sure but if you want them sitting in combat to be the slightest bit worthwhile you need to give them about a 5x10x boost to dps somehow focusfire ddd with no cooldown siege mode something i picked siege mode because its easiest to implement and to judge the merits of but its not necessarily the best solution
remove the gang bonus unless the ship is on grid but make it a stronger bonus something like 100 at lvl 5 thats the only change in that manner that needs fixing titans sieging would be silly in any manner whether based on current mechanics or otherthe scripting focus fire dd v my dd is a unique idea but the rof for either should not drop down below 30 min as titans would just be way way too powerful at that point
a titans main weapon should work against other capitals give them a ddturret call it what you likeyou lock your target fire the turret and it does its dmg over a time period of ca 60sec during this time it does enough dmg to kill the target lets say a pimped dread calculations up to ccp for this but because it takes 60sec the target can be repped if the targetsbuddies are fast on reaction yea i know lag is a problem if you are lucky you dont go pop but are heavy damagedthe ddturret then needs another 60sec to recharge then you can fire it againthis would have the following effects1 titan needs to be on grid to work and will be usefull for a whole battle not just 30sec of it2 the opponent needs to stay focused to remoterep the ddtargets carriers will be needed for this maybe even make triage more used maybe get the triage a bonus against the ddturret so that the titan will be an anti dread weapon to a lesser degree anti momcarrier
preferably no damage at alland wait a second you think blowing up most support class ships is ok but disabling modules for 20sec is too muchyoud rather be dead than disabled
no i cant support this one simple reason the devsif you invite them back into the loot tables they will only f it up more than they did last timetheir own 5 year track record is against them here when they f something up like the m3 exploit fix they never come back and fix it later in spite of their promises to the contraryadmittedly there are some decent ideas in this thread but i cant support it because i fear dev ineptitude more than i desire improvement in this areacheers
spoken like someone who has never set foot outside highsec
ok
not supportedi make the effort to lootsalvage wrecks and i like the fact that with a bit of extra effort i can provide myself with a small source of minerals and potentially the odd nice module to selllooters have already taken an unwarrented nerf by ccp clumsily attempting to combat the nonexistent problem of people building modules to compress minerals and bring them back to empire so looting is already harder now than it ever wasi dont agree that the t1 market is diminished by this  the chances of any one npcer happening to loot the exact modules he needs to fit his ship out are negligible at best  he will still be going to market for the ship itself and for part if not all of his fittingsalso the idea of making mining more meaningful through the context you describe is laughable until such times as macro miners have been scoured from the game  the sorry state of mining as a profession in eve is down to them nothing to do with npc loot drops
you realise were talking about mission loot not 00 rat loot
the thread title says remove loot from drop tables  it doesnt specify that it is referring only to missions and neither does the ops posti read that and understood we were talking about all npc drops regardless of sec status or whether it be belt rat or mission ratit would make no difference if it had meant mission loot and not belt npc loot i dont agree with the op about the supposed negative effects of t1 loot drops for the reasons ive described so i would still not be able to support the thread
i think this is a reasonable changethe mission system needs a bit of a overhaul the riskreward balance seems a little skewed
awsome ideano loot more lp yahoooooo
not supported at allit is excitement of finding decent loot knowing that in a pinch i can sell what i find for isk if i need it and giving things to others starting that makes it worthwhilethat is in addition to the loot and salvage adding immensely to the end of the mission and overall pull of isk from itthis suggestion is definitely not worth exploring
named loot should stay as it is t1 stuff that can be produced should not drop from npcs right now theres really no point to producing most modules because the market is so saturated with them people loot them sell them for below manufacturing costs and then theyre resold by a more dedicated trader but still for below manufacturing costs manufacturers should not be confined to producing ammo and ships  theres simply no profit in manufacturing most t1 modules unless you sell them in the middle of nowhere and even then you might get ok money for them but very little volume
economies function via supply and demand currently there is a good supply of t1 goods from loot drops demand is stable so prices stay low this is an excellent situation for newer players that can not earn vast amounts of isk to buy t2 modules etc and it also gives them an opportunity to rat and try out combatship setups etc with the added bonus of making some isk isk when you start out and many of you seem to have forgotten is hard to come byi have just completed 3 hrs of missions lvl 3 and purposefully collected all tech 1 loot etc i reprocessed this with maximum recovery and made just over 1 mil isk in minerals this is hardly going to impact the mineral marketsanyone can mine lets not kid ourselves that mining is something that is the preserve of a few someone mining for those 3 hrs can make more isk than i can from reprocessing with not very high skills the profits are greater for the miner the better ship she uses etc i suspect that the volume of minerals derived from loot reprocessing is small especially compared to hulk mining in low sec and 00 prices of minerals for miners arent affected by loot reprocessing they are affected by large corps and alliances dumping vast quantities of minerals onto markets in many cases the prices are manipulated by market racketeers which can greatly affect prices on many popular marketsmany highend minerals megacyte etc have ores limited to low sec or 00 only becuase there is a supply issue dropping loot will push these prices up higher making many items much more expensive and thus further out of reach of newer playersas for building and selling t1 items many already produce and sell below production costsnot due to the loot drops but due to sheer ignorance of costs the my minerals are free brigade etcgetting rid of loot drops will have widereaching negative implications especially for newer players the change will benefit a smaller group with more isk can someone enlighten me how making this group richer benefits the wider eve communitytake carearithron
i agree with you that an awful lot of t1 gear is sold at or below manufacturing cost  especially if you are diligent and include mineral cost bpc cost factory slot costs broker fees and sales taxes in your calculationhowever i still maintain that the principle reason behind this lies largely in two places  firstly macro miners and secondly players legitimately obtaining their resources who consider it free because they spent no isk on obtaining it confusing free with having no valuecompared to the two things above id be surprised if anyone could demonstrate that t1 loot from drops is having a significant effect on the t1 market  especially if you take a look at a mission site or npced system and see quite how many of them go unlooted anyway
hi guys i originally posted this as a petition and as per the direction of the gm im now putting up a thread herebasically this is the idea linkage  have a read and tell me what you guys think thts right devs cheers lark
drone bays in the same style as other pos defences i like it im not sure whether fighters or more conventional drones are preferable but something in this vein could work fairly well and if lag is an issue give them gargantuan hpdamage bonuses while making the numbers fairly small
very niceas was raised in the previous thread they shouldnt be able to warp off from the pos though
i have as well as others already suggested this in seveal other threads it just makes senseif ccp is so determined to do something about the speed problem then this is really the only way to go about it that doesnt break the game for people other than nanos unless the devs actually lived up to their names for once and actually developed something rather than nerfing the hell out of stuff that already exists new mods to help deal with these fast ships in pvp hello any devs not braindead in thereput a hard speed cap on ships and let the pilots decide which mods implants or skills they are going to use to reach that speedhell ccp already uses hard caps 250km max targeting anyone anyoneyeah ccp is blatantly ignoring this idea in several other places so ill give my support to it here so they can ignore this one too
you got my support
this is the best idea ive seen for this it forces ccp to finally say here here is exactly what our intended design is and it can never be broken by anything we add or change in the future this is how fast these ships are supposed to go in a balanced game
thank you for your comments yes the maintenance arrays in player alliances and pirate factions would be subject to the new condition and did agree to the new ship specification once the forensic findings were validated to everyones satisfaction it was seen by all to be an excercise in self interest to agree to something that would help all equally and harm none if all agreed further it was agreed that should any ships stray from the new specifications they would be immediately attacked by the other signatories to the accord thus enjoying an extremely short life as a shipthe above supplement to the storyline justification as well as the original storyline justification are extremely rough drafts they were the work of a matter of minutes and as such are not polished or fleshed out in the way i would normally write a story i only offered the storyline justification as a rudimentary idea outline if you will of how such a thing could be made more palatable to the residents of eve currently when ccp makes a change to the game they most often just do it and say there it is no ingame storyline reasoning my feeling is that makes for a poor presentation and it could easily be remedied for the benefit of subscriberssoall the above having been said your comments regarding the storyline justification are completely valid it does need work perhaps even a different storyline idea though i feel the original idea just needs a bit of worki hope youll reconsider supporting the speed hard cap as ive proposed the storyline can be worked into and around itregardswindjammer
fair reply but still if my pilot is also a skilled mechanic why cant he just remove the speed governor will concord or the empire factions pursue him into 00 for breaking the law will player owned alliances start hunting for these criminalsi do like having a speed cap but thats what ccp is doing just indirectly there is a hard cap on a ships max speed  it is the theoretical maximum with all best modules and by carefully nerfing the modules you can control the max speed of ships theres no need to implement a cap like this when it can be done with careful adjustments ccp just needs to learn what careful means but by using the test server i think theyre doing a good job i firmly believe all will be well after they revamp the patch
currently the ignore list for contracts stops at 80 entries given the immense amount of idiotic scammers placing want to buy orders as well as the already clumsy contract interface the limit for ignored buyerssellers should be expanded by a large amount i support eves cutthroat market and contract nature in general indeed stupid or inattentive people should be punished and have the opportunity to improve however the current contract system is already so slow and clumsy that the proliferation of lame dog want to buy contracts at 110 market value does not serve to reward the savvy buyers and punish the stupid rather such buy orders only clutter an already poor interface and prolong the agony when purchasing items we can only buy from contractsargh so given that intelligent buyers will strongly benefit from this enhanced feature and the stupid will fail to exercise their frontal cortex thus ensuring business as usual i would like to have a vastly expanded ignore list implemented for contracts at a minimum several hundred entries though i would prefer unlimitedthank you
heres a thumbs up as well since the forums ate my original tick on the support boxwhen are ccp going to fix their apparently patented programmed by stupids forums ever i could download free forum software that does a better job
id certainly like some enhanced filtering methods to be sureyou cant filter out wtb orders regardless if theyre twitscam or not which is one big annoyancein a game w 400k users it would sure be nice to ignore more than 80 idiots

the current format of cloaking works well if a player is playing the game according to the spirit of the gamethe issue lies with the number of players that choose to put their ship in a system safe spot cloak and proceed to continue with thier everyday duties whether this is work sleeping going to the pub playing another and actually not physically playing eve cjhoosing instead to spend a few times in their day to check to see if there are any easy kills to be had in the systemthe propsal is thiscovert cloaks into non passive modsthis would require some form of player intervention with the cloak at a point that it runs out the cap of the ship or the timer runs out for its use this would still enable cloaks to be a viable option fro monitoring ship movements stalking posibble targets and does nothing to nurf the cloakwhat this will do is require a player to actually be playing that character failure to see the timer running or or the cap running out will require some form of player interaction with his character in game thus failure to actually recloak will leave the character vulable to attack
question i have is how is that not according to the spirit of the gameand if you want to address afk players i feel a good balance would be to make sure those pesky afk mission runners and miners get the nerf bat tooapparently psyops really works
cloaks are already nonpassive  you have to activate them in order for them to workthe method of use you are referring to is recognised in the realworld military as a force multiplierfor example a sniper holes up somewhere and takes potshots killing enemy targets  enemies operating in that location then have constant anxiety about whether or not they are going to be the next snipe victim  regardless of whether or not the sniper is watching eating resting gone for a bio break whatevercloaks are just fine  you have excellent tools available to you in the forms of local scanner probes and buddies  make use of all four and you will soon find that cloaked hostiles are not really a problem at all
first off your position is ridiculous realism how can the word real or any derivative exist in an internet space ship game second do you have to go back to the very beginning of computer games and look at every game box and read what it says minimum requirements comes to my mind i do believe for the last 30 years game developers find system requirements to have a profound impact on the development of software where its ubiquitous throughout all aspects of game making now i didnt graduate from digipen but it doesnt take a genius to figure out your statement defies all logicwhile minimum system requirements are advised for the client machine so to should the limitations on game mechanics which are tools by which players interact with the eve cliente and cluster it is impossible to find poasts on caod on the first forum page that deal with fights where lag is not mentioned where ccplag and all other derogatory references to poor server performance is not mentioned impossiblethe goals of the proposal are to hit 3 points 1 simplified changes to encourage small gang activity within the current system of sov in 002 mitagate game play which leads to mundane tasks less refueling of towers less time shooting stationary objects3 investigate the impact of those changes on the effectiveness of loading grids with massive numbers of players and decrease the importance of lag as an active participate for the defendermore intuitive outcomes of the proposed changes are what most major blob fest nap alliances would fear by reducing the impact of isolated sovsystem contests huge implications to how alliances govern there space are clearly evident if at anyone moment installations can be attacked with real consequences calling upon action alliances may wish to stay home to protect those assets leading directly to the end of huge nap mega blocks as corporations and alliances of all sizes can engage assets on a more balanced playing field these are the ultimate goals to encourage self sufficiency and serious and deliberate politics not phone a friend alliance politics which is currently in eve
if distributed objectives were programmed into the game the way strontium was they too would exist in the eve universe its all contrived to the point that contrivance carries little meaning if its in the interest of good game designthe jamming interferes with life support systems on the station voila
basically my point is that game mechanics designed around metagame problems is less than desirable personally it works yes but it feels more like artificial restrictions than an organic emergent system
we are talking hit points they were given too many imo and they should be reduced the whole point of station services and anchorables outside the pos was to give small gangs the oppertunity ccp just gave them too much i understand what you mean about restrictions like you cant carry full haulers in a carrier only charges and scripts but reducing hp is nothing like that
move moon miners outside shields and decrease their hp boom something for my small gang to shoot when the residents dockpos up anoying for the defenders that chose not to defend but doesnt cripple their infrastructure it is a small roaming gang afterallagreeing with tarminic on 1 as well big battles should be forced eventuallyjammer away from poses is a nice idea perhaps only at planets planets without stations even those shiny pos modules and  make the grid load a 
that would be a bit easy and change the importance of the tower itself the goal is to engage the infrastructure not to destroy it but to be able to select point of contention with less resources and balance the fight for the defenders and attackers
this is a thing that have bugged me for some time and its the fact that you need standings with a corporation to use jump clones if i recall correctly it is 60 in standings that is needed to use jump clones which is a really horrible limitation especially for pirates such as myself for me to effectively use jump clones i would probably have to grind standings for a couple of weeks it is also a real limitation on traders who might just want to trade and not skill up for running missionshere is my suggestion1 make jump clones available for everyone with the skills needed2 make the price of the jump clones dependent on your standing with the corporation you got your jump clones withfx a jump clone could cost 10 million if you got 0 in standings then for every 01 difference in standing the price of the jump clone changes by 1 this means if you got 100 in standing with a corp jump clones are free but if you got 100 in standing you pay twice the price meaning 20 million this means that standings still have a very important impact on the use of jump clones but they are free for use to everyone
the obligatory 1 support
dont neeed dev time just look for mcorp clone serrvices many corps offer infinite clone make for 10mln or so
you shouldnt need to use a 3rd party corporation to do this personally i dont have this problem as i have access to 00 outposts but i remember how much it sucked before that
its 80
i agree either lower it or make it skill dependant intstead of standings
i support this concept disclaimer i was in no way forced to post my support honest
i support this awell however that means for the past week all my grindin would be pointless
oh come on its gotten way easier used to be your corp had to have ludicrously high standings tooi want to say 80 which meant that one guy starting to run missions would destroy your ability to install jcs but no this ones been patched well enough by player clone vats for my liking perhaps come up with a way to put clone vats in highseclike my thread a few weeks back to have research lines in offices but no dont reduce the standings requirement
its easy enough to get an inside jumpclone contract as it is no more watering down jumpclone mechanics
main problem with the standings is this when you jumpclone out of a station where you do not have sufficient standings why are they required to install a contract for you as you leavethis is a loopholecontradictionwhatever that should be either closed by not installing the jc as you leave or opened by removing standings completely
not supportedyour to clueless to get jumpclones and now you want to change game mechanicsyour sure your a pirate and not a whining winger carebear 
hey he said he was a pirate suck it up rat girl this guys with your groupwindjammer
ok oh wise one tell me how i am to get jumpclones instead of flaming me at the forumsam i supposed to grind standings to 80 with corps while i am 10and dont tell me get jump clones with a third partyi would like to use jump clones for other things than just changing implantsi am pretty sure i am a pirate i earn my isk from looting and ransoming
could pay a station holding corp for standings and docking rights but yeah i think the high standings requirement is just a stupid unnecessary grind for most eve playersas if ill ever get 80 standings with anything lololololzorz
so let me get this straight you have a thread in general discussion saying that level 4 missions are to valuable for their risk and either they need to be nerfed or 00 needs to be buffedthen you have this thread here discussing how high end minerals in losec and 00 are to valuableok gotcha
agreed this is where the flooding of the vast majority of the mid to low range moon mins come from
admittedly this idea is not completely 100 original on my part but i thought it was good enough to give its own threadthe problem as i see it is that everyone ccp included knows that macros and isk farmers sellers are out of control but precious few people have any valid solutions beyond what ccp is already doing and failing miserably atsome people have suggested forcing players out of npc corps once their characters are a certain age thus allowing them to be war decced by players who feel their game behavior is infringing on the rules andor spirit of the game while this idea has some merit imho it is also fraught with problems that might drive some potential legitimate players awayit has been suggested that instead of taking the forced out of npc corps approach that a simple extension of the trial account limitations would be more than enough to make life much more difficult for potential eve abuserswhat this means is simply this start limiting what ships a player can fly while in a npc corp no mining barges or exhumers for a start no battleships and battlecruisers later on this would put a big dent in macro users and mission farmers  isk sellers in that they would have to open themselves up to potential war deccs to use those ships players could then start to do a much better read more active job of rooting these scum out than ccp seems to be capable ofnow before we get too far note that i said limit the ships they can fly not the ships that they can own andor have it is just while they are in an npc corp they cant take these types of ships out of station the rp reason for it could be simple your current corporate charter is not licensed for use in the craft you are trying to undock inlegitimate players should have no problems with this limitation because single few man corporations are already everywhere forming your own corp takes having a single entry level skill at level 1 a one time token amount of isk and you dont even have to pay for an office if you dont want tosure macro users and isk farmers would shift around in player corps to avoid these war deccs but doing so can be considered an exploit and eventually lead to banning that is super easy for ccp gms to check up on and prove unlike most of the farming and macros these days abusers could pad their player corps with as many dummy characters as they wanted it would be super easy for the gms to see which characters were active and which were not then when only the active characters went to leave a corp to dodge a dec bam exploit warning a few of these and a permaban couldnt be far awayanyway i thought the idea had merit and wanted to put it out there for the players and the csm to gander at for those who loathe threads about macros and isk farmers i apologize for putting you through the horrific torture of having to look at another one i know youll be damaged for years needing lots of therapy but at least this one included a solution that i think will actually significantly helpyes there are more pressing issues out there for ccp to worry about but isk farmerssellers and macros are a cancer that is slowly eating out the heart of our beloved game and ccp seems wholly unwilling or unable to do anything significant to stop their progress replies for and against are welcomeps i give full credit and acknowledgement to others who have suggested this idea or other extremely like it elsewhere
i like it the idea has a lot of potential with very little downside from my point of viewat least it is better than what ccp is doing about them now which amounts to nothingat worst the idea wont help at best it will improve the game for everyone in one way or anothersupport
agreed with the proviso that this should only apply in hisec
it would also have the bonus of getting mission runners out of npc corps as well
tentative support for this ideai can see how this idea could help in combatting macro minersmacro mission runners specifically as their trade is generally plied in high sec space and if the idea helps in that regard only it is deserving of supporthowever im not convinced isk farming would be affected in the slightest by any of these proposals  whybecause for isk farming to be worthwhile you have to be regularly scoring bs kills which means 00 ratting so wardecability means nothing anywayas a 00 resident i have some experience of a particular group of isk farmers  they were in a player created corp not npc and had set up shop in some of the backwater systems of the region i call home after we killed a few of their ratting ships they quickly cottoned onto the idea of not warping to 0km in belts and make full use of cloaking and logoff game mechanics to avoid being probed outi think ccp eventually caught them as they all stopped logging in one day  all the characters in all the systems disappeared at the exact same timehowever soon they were back with different characters of course but they set up in the same systems and behaved in the same way  im as sure as i can be that they were the same people  this cycle has happened three times now and were currently free of that group of isk farmers although im expecting them back any day nowanyway now you have my life story about my local isk farmers  in short i think if ccp are doing as good a job universewide as they are locally to me then whilst not ideal they are still clearly working on the problem and obviously care about it  so notwithstanding the feeling that your ideas will not combat isk farming at all i am happy for now to leave them in the hands of ccp and support your ideas for how they may help combat macro minersmissioners in high sec
i do support this idea however there are going to be many people that dontit would have a bad effect on the people who like to run level 4 missions and remain in the npc corp to avoid wardecs i dont believe this is a bad thing but i imagine their opposition will be very vocal and very strong there is a fairly large community of people who are active members in the npc corps they wont want to leave the friends they have made in the npc corpthe npc faction warfare corps should be exempt from this change for obvious reasons players could join this corp as an alternative to the starter npc corp but this would lead to players who do not contribute to the war effort skewing the fw stats
good idea
put this in asap
denied until they fix wardec at this time a lot of legit players stay in npc corps doing their thing missions mining manufactureing etc because they dont want to be wardeced for stupid reasons forcing them to be in a 1 man corp suddenly causes them to be targets of this idiocy that plagues wardec at the moment fix how wardec works then maybe this idea has merit but at the current time thumbs down
would you mind giving an example of one of these stupid reasons
yes because who needs a large portion of the subscriber base anyways word of advice to those who want to nerf npc corps forcing people out of their preferred play styles because it offends you is boorish and bad for business besides
perhaps you did not read slowly enough or understand what you read this idea doesnt force anyone to do anything it simply expands limits that are already in place in the gamethis doesnt even limit what you can train or own simply what you can fly when in a npc corpit also doesnt limit people opting out of participating in war deccs it only limits how much isk they can make when they do thus it encourages people to pvp but does not force them to which is obviously what ccp had been trying to do since the inception of the game kinda like factional warfareso with all that said not seeing your point at all i am affraid
not supporting thisa much more reasonable fix would be to limit the amount of time people can play eve per day your average person works for 7 or 8 hours a day and sleeps for 8 hours leaving 89 hours to play evelimit it to 8 hours cumulative and then your eve client closes until the next day only bots and isk sellers play 23 hours a day
an unrealistic solution based upon a false assumption
i never said it was a solution i said it was more reasonable you made a false assumption in assuming it was a solution
nicely done
ccp should actually take action against isk farmers problem solved
i support this
perma ban anybody caught buying or selling isk for a startwe already had a way to deal with isk sellers it was called suicide ganking some people abused it and started ganking for the hell of it we all thought this was ok and part of eves cold harsh universe ccp have now told us we were wrong and its not now ccp have had to nerf suicide ganking in an effort to stop it before it becomes an epidemic given the track record do you honestly think that some players can be trusted not to use or abuse this for anything else than its intended purpose im afraid i dont share your faith in the players
more accurate than the op though
im not sure that the specifics mentioned in the op are the ideal ones but i like the idea and think it should be given consideration
thumbs upthey also need to have war flags carry over per pilot so that once the dec comes down the person can go wherever they want but theyre still at war for the duration eliminate the corp jumping exploitif they join another player corp their war flag does not extend to that corp but that corp can assist their new member and aggression et alneutral parties not in the players corp assisting a war target or jumping into a war corp and back out will give that full duration war flag to the neutral and the corp flea
oh there already are hundreds of them its just like a 00 alliance300 in alliance chat only 30 wanting to do more than putter around doing their own thing
imo back to the drawing board your idea if implemented would affect the macro miners to some extent but at the same time negatively impact those players who enjoy being solo flyersi know people will cry out multiplayer and such but these people still pay their subscriptions and as such it is a valid playstyle ive also known a few folks active players who prefer to remain in the npc corps for war dec protection again flame suit on but this is their choice they wish to minemission in safety more subscription money for evealso players who may have exited a corp and are currently seeking a new one would be nerfed to only fly certain ships what about mr joe pvp who is an awesomesauce bs pilot and wants to demonstrate this to his potential new corp by flying alongside them get in your cruiser nub same thing for super minergirl looking to get into that new club of miners t1 mining frigateclosing basically your idea has some merit imo but it has some serious flawsholes that would need to be worked out so as legitimate players were not unduely affected by a blanket nerf if you want any indications of the outcries from blanket nerfs look at some of the speedsuicide gank threads of late
i dont like your corps namei wanted to name my corp thatyou ignored me in localyou have only 3 members woot easy target for out 100member corpyou said i smell in local
sorry this is a bad idea whilst it would help police the current problems it would also infringe on a legitimate playing style people should be able to choose to play eve in the way they like once they have a paid account not have the possibility of war decs forced upon them simply to fly around in bigger ships also just after ccp introduces something that will curb more of the highsec ganking your then introducing something that will do the complete opposite
orour alts have lots of cash lets just wardec any mining group we see in local so we can get our killboards up
i would like to be able to make up my own ships paint scheme would it be possible to make up a patch tomake this possible
no
first off since it would cause server stress there must be an option to disable itif this were the case i would immediately turn it off to improve client performance but the person with the supercomputer and superbandwitdh wouldnt have to turn it offnow custom paint schemes or other graphics whatnot give an advantage to people who use it as they can identify certain players quickly without using the overview thus mr supercomputer has an advantage because he has a better computer than i doccp would never include a mechanic that both 1 requires a better computer to run efficiently and 2 gives an advantage to players who use itnote that the premium client only fulfills part one of these characteristics
i hear posting the same thing over and over in caps bold and underline at the same time is a good way to get your point across
stop posting multiple threads on the same stupid subject and underlining them posting same exact rubish in multiple forums is called cross posting and is not a good way to sway peoplei used all caps and underlined the texts because it seems this person can only understand things in caps and underlined
i would like to be able to make up new paint and paint scheme for my shipsi think it would give players more of there own identity
stop cross posting same crap over and over
please see the following thread and read the documentation for proposed changes to the bounty system and merc system
seems like youre pretty on target going to reword this to be sure were on the same frequency sorry my writing isnt succinct  going to flesh out some details as wellproper array combat managementattacking an array causes the tower to try and heal the array back to operational shield level five minutes from now tower estimates how much the array will need based on dps calcsthe behavior is designed to keep arrays very relevant all throughout a large fleet pos fight a bs fleet that tried to knock out every array by moving around as a single blob would find the tower healing arrays in their wake thus to keep arrays offline its almost necessary to camp all of them the brute force method is effectively volunteering to be divided across several gridsa cheaper way to nullify the arrays pilotwise is to leave the arrays online and simply intercept the shield bursts in their early stages this allows a handful of fast ships to counter the arraysfurthermore if you instead do just enough damage to trigger the effect not trying to offline arrays the tower will have overestimated the necessary amount of aid if you can do this fast enough the pos will be donating shield at an unnecessarily swift rate to the arraysthe ninja reinforcement maneuvernormally the tower is thinking that it will be receiving shield bursts from the arrays thus tower is trying to invest its own shield towards eventually gaining more back through shield bursts laterhowever you can execute both special techniques simultaneously force the tower to overheal the arrays and interdict any shield bursts from the array to the tower the tower will be receiving no hp back and will be sacrificing an inordinate amount of its own shield to keep the arrays online even though they might not truly be under serious threat its a design built for largefleet efficiency that can be tricked by midsize gang cleverness into instead multiplying their forcesninjareinforcement technique limitationthe benefit of the technique is less muscle required the drawback is more timeyou can only cause the tower to donate up to 25 of array max shields at a tiem this is because the array will go into reinforced at 25 nullifying any further dps of anyone sitting there and only need to be at 50 to become online again maximum dps you can inflict with this method is thus capped by the interval of healing and maximum shield boost size its a ninja method that only scales up so farcynojam implicationssomething very dear to all our readers hearts if a tower is hosting a cyno jammer you can potentially get the tower into reinforced without ever laying eyes on the cynojam just need a lot of support and good ewar for any carriers that show up at the tower requires five times the titans to camp
agree wholeheartedly ill bet the reason for opposition to the pos system as the only determination of sov is almost 99 due to the flaws of pos warfare fixing pos warfare will go a long way towards fixing them as instruments of sov kelsins goals for startgate capture can probably be attained to a large degree by better pos warfare which benefits all parties
i dont particularly care for the pos donating shield to the arrays as much as i prefer the pos shield recharge rate being decreased say each array has a max recharge rate that is of 14 the max rate of the pos bringing each array to max recharge simultaneously will bring the pos down to 0 shield recharge destroying an array should hurt the maximum shield capacity hurting the rate furtherhaving physical shield bursts that can be destroyed i personally dont care for are ships supposed to follow them between grids also i dont like the idea of a pos going into reinforced after having only attacked its perimeter it still must be dealt damage directly to be reinforced
i love your new pos mechanism ideas with reinforced mode and stuff but the ferry dronse and voluntary things i dunno about but you have my support but this idea needs working onalso threads like this puts a smile on my face it shows the eve wont die tomorrow and it has alot to improve since its still in its baby stage
if arrays are destroyable a blob will just have to make a tour of the arrays and then go blow up the tower like usual any method of tying the arrays to the tower needs to keep all five grids relevant at all times otherwise well keep seeing singlegrid fights the reinforcement behavior of the arrays is designed to solve thisarguably pos warfare should require dreads to tank the guns and thus require a nonmobile deployment that is committed to trying to take the tower down this isnt 100 true nowi know what kelsins supporters are after though and opening the field for midsized gangs to do it as well albeit slowly and able to be stopped cold by caps at the tower would be healthy for 00 combatstill yet one of the original goals of pos warfare was to give a defensive advantage currently guns are only at the tower though so reinforcement via arrays breaks this rule i guess there could be guns at the arrays question is how many guns and if the arrays get a bubble to protect the gunners not quite settled on thati like the tangible targetable shield burst idea because it provides another way for more mobile forces to play a very pivotal role in pos warfare bss can do it to so its not going to require a shift in fleet distribution even if it makes differentiation more attractive a burst that can be targeted can also be triaged and the geometric growth rate will take off if given an early boost its a method for attackers and defenders to very directly affect what happens at the tower from the arrayno ships dont follow them between grids once a burst has built to size at an array it is sent to the pos its essentially out of anyones hands at that point as for the pos since its cannibalizing its own shields it doesnt use the same process and thus its bursts are not targetablethink of it as a limited oneway relationship you can influence the tower from an array but not the array from the tower its possible to triage the tower or reinforce the tower directly so its not entirely oneway anything else would again allow a huge blob to blob the tower and ignore the arraysi understand it would be much simpler to simply use recharge rate relationships but these wont provide as much avenue for small skirmishes or fleets of ospreys to force the attacker to stay involved at all arrays i know it sounds overcomplicated and annoying but am confident it wouldnt look so complex on sisi
ok so major question then if gangs are deployed only at the arrays and the shield bursts is it possible to reinforce the pos without ever firing directly at the control towerif that is true then i cant support it at some point damage must be dealt directly
well its still up for discussion actually can you tell me more about why you in principle disagree with this capabilityin principle i think there should be a strong relationship between arrays and the tower the goal is break a singlegrid fight into a multigrid fight as such the array should be a path to the tower both for defense and offense as the design stands now of the methods open to the attacker is to trigger the pos to overheal arrayscan guns at the arrays maybe 14th available at towerneeds more thought work towards alleviating your concerns
mainly because of thisshould the owner of the pos would have the ability to disable any transfer of shield to protect the main structure basically one may in character say these shield bursts are killing my pos lets turn them off what do you mean theres not an off switch who engineered this thing without this ability to disable the mechanic it seems restrictive for ingame reasonsof course enabling the deactivation of shield transfers may cause many to just simply turn it off all the time and not care if their arrays go down forcing the attackers to engage at the pos after some thought this really negates the argument for recharge rate and really for any sort of posarray defense assistance that drains the posadditionally for what ingame reason must the arrays be located off grid if i were a pos owner id just anchor them all together  in other words why is there this artificial distance between pos and arraysi think it is for these reasons why im losing faith in the separation solution to pos destruction not because your idea is bad but because it so well thought out it is revealing the inherent flaws in the broader concept
this frankly isnt going to solve the blobbing situation one bit if a defense fleet is larger than an attacking fleet and the attacking fleet splits off to take out one modulation array at a time theres nothing to stop the defenders kerbstomping one fleet thats less than a quarter of the size of theirs at a time until theyre dead if the attacking fleet is larger then theyll wipe the floor by balling up job donein fact youve managed to turn one boring pos siege into five boring pospos modulating array sieges this idea is even worse than the last one where do you cretins keep on coming up with this crap the uwe boll memorial home for criminally insane ideas that should never have seen the light of dayand just to pick up on the original post if you hadnt noticed a pos burns all but two of its fuel types no matter how much stuff youve got onlined the ballache is getting of of it into empire and reducing the amount of ozone and liquid oxygen isnt going to be the universal panacea that you make it out to be
precisely proposing this as a nonvoluntary change to mechanics as for the question of why they cant be turned off why doesnt unused strontium go back into the bay when you rep a pos out of reinforced it would make sense but there has to be a price for filling up the bay with stront and playing hide and seek with carriersthe arrays operate a gravitational flux field in the space between the array and the tower the field harvests the gravitational flux that occurs in the tide of space normally an imperceptible current when collected over a large distance it becomes a strong power sourcei believe they should be set up such that when you go to anchor them they warp themselves offgrid in a neat configuration one towards the star one to the left right and away from the starall in all i dont think poss are failing 100 this is a game and we need to have something to stimulate some agreement as far as when fights occur otherwise theres no indication of where to meet and when for the showdown if anything the pos system is a good fight broker meet us on the playground at 511 in two days three hours and fourtytwo minutes if you dont show up were going to blow up your tower
if the attacking force is bigger and throws everything at the tower you park your carriers at arrays and indirectly rep the pos to the point of tears since their dreads arent going anywhere fast you can afford to triage wiping the floor against a fully loaded deathstar thats recieving 10m shield hitpoints every five minutes is hardly a picnicif the defending force is bigger with current mechanics you probably wouldnt be winning the battle anyway in my proposal at least you can try to force them into bad skirmishes using feints while trapping their main forces you might be able to turn it uphill for them if the situation is really bad just split up to other systems and run up the fuel bill dont get caughtyoure absolutely correct about the dynamics of having to split up forcing a divided fleet means vulnerability to being blobbed while divided this is why you have to play your cards slowly and try to win as much ground with as few ships as possible keeping your cavalry available to open up a retreat or to pin a routed enemy trying to keep some caps safed up until you can field them advantageously this forces you to constantly skirmish all over the pos and if you cant win the skirmish fights without blobbing you end up overcommitted at one location and outflanked at another on the other hand if you can force the enemys hand you will gain a huge tactical advantageyou have to fight five fights and coordinate them well without showing too much skin you have to pay a lot of attention to a force even half your size since they will wipe out a deployment that gets trapped away from friends you have to win lots of small skirmishes all the way down to onevsone dogfights you have to treat any threat as a potentially dangerous one you have to pounce on every single opportunity if the enemy gets overextended pound on their weak spots if theyre flatfooted outmaneuver themthis can only be boring if youd rather have the privilege of ignoring any hostile gang not at least 75 your size since theyre going to get rolled
just to respond to this point  i dont think small gangs should be attacking and destroying pos i think theres a vital and valuable role for siege fleets for that purpose the problem is that setting up and knocking down pos is a poor method of determining who owns space ownership of space and the benefits that come with it should be based on something far more comprehensive if defenders are to have abilities like the jump bridge that confer great power in dealing with small gang incursions then part of the system that grants those abilities should be based on small gang combatthe current system is very feudal allowing the control of space by constructing and sieging fortresses what im interested in is modernizing it
i just started a thread in jita park linkage about the fundamentals of sovereignty
forgive me for making such a ridiculous mistake about my own proposal but its not possible to destroy a pos with a small gang in this setupits possible to reinforce the pos and run it down to zero shields when it goes out but you have to shoot the armor and thats not connected to the arrays you cant hurt pos armor via the arrays so in the end you have to do something at the towersmall gangs can run up the fuel bill and disrupt moon mining in this setup but can never take down a tower and destroy hardware that would still require a gang and dreadswith that ill skip the question of guns and bubbles at the arrays for now no theyll just be naked
ohgod i hate tower sieges a few more silent details that are built into the designpos warfare fuel costsafter some more consideration id like to shed some more light on fuel consumption and reinforcement these relationships are based on a concept of more meaningful sovereignty defacto economic sovereignty means you are making money off of a system having a tower thrown into reinforced should be pretty expensive and strain logistics to maintain a power with towers can never be removed by simply reinforcing towers all the time but they might choose to leave if its costly enough sov gained through the ceding of territory isnt a recognition of who can win outright pos warfare but that the power ceding territory has less interest than the power taking it it would be a healthy thing for 00 and would place less emphasis on the fleet battles although its still possible to burn down all the towers if you have enough muscle and willpowerif you havent read the op and followed the thread its possible via a loophole for a midsized gang to reinforce a tower without sieging it no dreads required can only destroy with siege but reinforcement can be done albeit slowly without touching the towergoals of fuel consumption behaviorif you really want a territory you can field a tower that gives you much more capability to protect yourself form large threats but at the price of exposure to smaller threats thus requiring more defacto sovereignty to come ahead on economicallyif you dont really care for a territory you have to expose yourself to smaller siege fleets in return for the decrease in expense and less defacto sov requiredspecific amendments for pos fuel consumptioncurrent towers are given one fourth their powergrid and one fourth their shield hpi hate tower sieges raise the reinforcement shield level to 60 so that there is less needless shooting of a giant structure nobody cares about the first 40 of shields since the defender rarely shows up for this phase buffs to tower hp via arrays make this change especially necessarywith no arrays the tower has to use internal power sources that require maintenance thus a high 250 of current npc mechanical parts etc fuel consumption rateeach array provides a full half of current power grid to the tower and a boost of one eigth of current shield hp raising death star firepower with four arrays above existing death stars while boosting postreinforcement hpeach array lowers npc fuel types required by 225 with four bringing npc fuel consumption to 25 of currentwhenever the tower goes into reinforced the arrays do not contribute to powergrid a tower in reinforced is saying my owning alliance has invested a lot of fuel to buy the opportunity to protect me until they can come to my defensewithout the arrays online and contributing power grid the rate of fuel consumption is quadruple that of the base tower with the tower supplying all of the power grid via emergency hardware this works out to 1000 npc fuel rate and 632 lo rate all on top of strontiumfuel bay size should appropriately increased to allow for the same time frames of fuelingreinforcementthe result of these modifications is that a naked tower can be fielded for handsfree management but will be easy to burn down thus if you dont want to deal with keeping defacto sovereignty you will have it taken by force from you more easilya much beefier tower can be fielded if youre willing to take on midsized gangs who show up in your territory you must have defacto sovereignty or else face serious blows to economic sovereignty in the form of fuel bills every time the enemy decides to come visit

i agree for this idea that i have quoted my support is for doing something and if we do somethingi support this idea that zareph thought of
game needs more nodes pls or some kind of solution 600 v 600 might still be laggy but do not lag out people doing 2v2 or 4v4s on empty systems ie game lacks nodes so empt systems gets lumped together and if blob war happens then everybody even those 100s of jumps away but on same node suffers due to lack of nodes
id like to see a response just because itd cut down on the arguments
why does someone with corp name lowsec liberators want a pvpfree zone in eve indeed why would we want one at all or am i missing your point somewhere in that argument lacking any depthby lowering the penalty for fighting in lowsec it takes longer to get to 5 meaning a starting pirate can spend longer having access to highsec explain to me please how this makes a pirates life hardereven though ive disagreed with you on occasion i can support that notion nothing wrong with more info however id say we all deserve the response not just those who have been in the game a long time after all from a business perspective ccp has already had your money its us newer players they want to keep tempting so yes and since i forgot in my previous post to do so i support the notion even with ki ans rather unpleasant way of handling itedit id suggest however having a good read of this post just as a potential different spin on things whether you agree or not i think it does give a hint as to where ccp might be coming from
the problem many probably have too many chatchannels unable to read their titlesi was thinking that that could be fixed by merging the tab format of the corporate hangars into the chat windows 4tabs with 3 under themthe idea has had some positive respons in the features and ideas discussion section with so far nothing negativepeople with small resolutions will benefit greatly from this as most older players have many channels to keep in touch or see intelligence high resolution players still gain from this as they can read the full channelnames with amount of players in it etcdownside would be that the amount of space reserved for actual text would be a little reduced but in my opinion it is too little to be noticedthank youmoizo
almost a duh i like minimizing the width of the chat window and pushing it off to the left but i want access to all of the tabs good issue
this seems nice
x the ninja salvager should not be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because i support ccps current ruling that salvage is free for anyone with the proper tools to retrieve from wrecksas a newbie to the game i have only recently started salvaging and i have not tried the ninja salvaging scenario described in the original post i have recently spent several hours combining gurista pirate hunting with the salvaging of abandoned wrecks in doing a repeating circuit of spawn sites for pirates i found at least three clearly abandoned wrecks for every pirate located when i logged off after a couple of hours of repeating the same circuit i had left behind dozens of yellow containers it is very clear to me that the owners of the kills had no intention of salvaging or even looting the wrecksthis is similar to other online games i have played such as wow you go out to harvest critters for the hides and find that someone has simply killed all the good critters in an area and left the bodies unskinned this is identical to what i have observed on my gurista pirate hunting circuit therefor i must vote in favour of wrecks being available for anyone to salvage if i understand the conversation on this subject the ninja salvager is not subject to attack by the bad guys the mission runner is taking on this seems unreasonable i would suggest that anyone entering the mission area should be subject to attack by the bad guys this seems more realistic and subjects the ninja salvager to some of the risk in wow if i follow another player looking to skin bodies heshe abandons i am still subject to attack by the local critters please excuse my ignorance if i have misunderstood the immunity aspect of the debate thank you
you just admitted that youre stealing his stuff i guess that kinda derails your entire argument
thats not true isk has real world utility and requires a significant realworld investment to obtain the gamecard market is a great testament to that
stupid thread leave high sec and go play the real game
it is the fault of older players that mandate the training of learning skills that newbies are turned off not the fault of the system itself players getting a feel for the game shouldnt bother with learning skills and if they are subjected by vets and listen to them they are being too impressionable rather than assessing the situation themselves if a vet told you to jump off a bridge
lol so then youre proposing that new players should remain ignorant of the fact that theyre being punished so it wont bother them cmon thats just stupid thats like saying its ok for a noob to jump off a bridge so long as they remain blissfully ignorant of the consequencesthe fact is that training learning skills is always the best strategy in the long run and by choosing not to train learning skills youre doing nothing but penalizing yourself of course a noob who learns that this is going to be upset its the system that causes the problem not the noobs awareness of the systemyou might as well say we should destroy all documentation of the combat systems mechanics so that way people will be blissfully ignorant of how good or bad their weapons are and we can all be happy using crummy fits and blaming our losses on luck
but its not as simple yes train them or no dont train them it is up to the player exactly how far they want to take their learning skills at different stages of their characters life should they train them all at once should they space them out with their other skills so its not so boring should they wait until frigate v to train up all of their perception and engineering v for intelligence because most of the gains will be seen on these chunks of skills anywayits an important sandbox feature that in essence gives players a chance to be proactive or procrastinate depending on their play style and personality
yes they get more points period they are better off by training them all at onceand here you hit the nail on the head why have skills that are boring none of the other skills are boring why is boredom even a factor in how much you as a player are rewarded especially from the very beginning it makes no sense from a game design perspective if im a new player i want to jump into all the games features but then i find out that i lose out on the games most important resource if i dont spend at least half a month boring myself out of my mind how does that hook me into the gamethe longer they wait the more skill points they lose im afraid i cant come up with any boredom utility to skill point utility ratios so i cant apply any economic ideas to itso you want the game to be work and responsiblity online
so strill all i have seen from you is whining have not seen one reasonable suggestion of any kindit is obvious you have no clue what you are talking about and you are whining because its toooo hard no one is making you train  i did not train my learning skills till at least a month or two in the game at that point i made the decision to stay with the game then i started training the skills to help me alongand at that time you had to level out at 5 before you could train the advanced set
add a topic there should be a way to replace the csm head rep once you find out the one you elected is a total moron and has no idea about anything except roll playing a girl so he can meet boys online and get confronted by chris hansen and end up in jail with his front teeth knocked out
could we please have fleet battle lag discussed as an issue at the meeting it has been raised a number of times  for example
yes fix the lag we know ccp knows and by now most tibetan monks probably know
im back from holidays today so will be attending
what makes you think ccp know the only quote ive seen from ccp on fleet battle issues comes from further up this thread as follows nathan ccp said that he does not believe that current largescale fleet combat is interesting for the participants mainly due to focus firethat comment didnt come from someone who has experienced fleet battles current issues ismt it worth discussing this explicitly with ccp rather than just saying yes yes of course everyone knows about that 
they know about lag you dont need to tell them about lag at all
is there a problem with putting it on the issues list it isnt there currentlyis there a problem with discussing it in the csm meeting surely it would be worthwhile
i wouldnt be opposed to knowing exactly what they are doing to improve performance
those tibetan monks are wise and surely know the answers to all questions maybe csm should discuss sending nozh to tibet to find out what the solution is
thats exactly how it works ccp spin the wheel of nerf and sledgehammer whatever it lands on nano this time usually while at the same time completely ignoring screwed ships and mechanics for months and months blackops cyno jammers jumpbridges bombs range rig stacking bug etc etcof course the players and particpants in whatever style of play dont get a say ccp dont give a crap what you think
linkage to the assembly hall thread sovereignty is often recognized as territory and the ability to control that territory territory in the scope of this game is vague  system control is the current setup but it is determined by the control of uninhabited moons additionally at its root it this definition is not specific in how control is definedso we have the problem of deciding first what territory are we controlling and second how exactly we are imposing our sovereignty this thread will look at these two fundamental concepts within the context of eve and hopefully will present a foundation upon which a proposal can be made for a new game mechanic that clearly and sensibly defines how we control territoryterritory is important to look at first an alliance wishing to claim sovereignty over a system must essentially control its inhabitants and unlike empire space where stations are abundant there are not many places for a systems inhabitants to live other than planets this is assuming the followingfirst it is assumed that moons are all uninhabitable second it assumes that outposts being controlled by alliances are primarily built for function refining research service administration factory cloning etc and not for supporting lots of people other than the crew of the outpost third it assumes that any other habitable structure is unregistered and is located in a deadspace location these three assumptions narrow down the location of the majority of the population of a system to its planets and as such these should be the focus of territory i think that exerting control of a 23 majority of planets and major habitable moons should they be included would give an entity sovereignty of a systemnow control can be broken down into three fundamental categories military control economic control and cultural control typically control would be imposed by planetside government that to some extent controls military economy media or some combination of the aforementioned depending on the governments personality and basic beliefs but were a bunch of capsuleers and wouldnt bother with petty involvements
taking an idea from factional warfare occupancy control of a planet could take place at a sort of control bunker call it whatever you like the owner of the control bunker in effect controls the planet and ownership is determined by an entitys influence over the planet this is where the 3 forms of control come into play the entity that has the most forms of control  military economic and cultural  is the entity that holds the most influence and is credited with controlling the planetthe mechanic that determines planetary influence could be orbital structures military structures would be the hardest to destroy but would provide no benefit to the controlling organization and require many resources economic structures would provide an income to the controlling entity and be defendable but not as hard shelled as a military base cultural structures would involve media control and entertainment fragile and subject to propaganda and psyops infiltration thus requiring the most attention but providing massive rewards to the alliance surpassing that of economic influencethis allows multiple play styles and forms of empire building on the defensive economic infrastructure can be built up with military support and finally culture can flourish resulting in stronger control on the offensive a blitz campaign can occur where only military bases are setup while all other structures are destroyed resulting in police control most similar to pos warfare military superiority coupled with owning the only economic structure would result in control of a planetor an alliance can resort to cultural subversion and economic disruption practicing guerilla tactics to slowly erode the influence of the current owner and most interestingly this allows three entities to compete and essentially be tied on a planet if each focuses on a different form of influencethe exact mechanics arent really complete and would be up to ccp anyway but a system similar to the influencecontrolsovereignty model allows for a wide array of play styles and tactics in gaining territorial control there is still the option of military only like the current system but also the option of refining your empire to provide rewards could be determining factors for level of sov or constellation sov and now there are ways of overthrowing enemy control in ways other than who has more guns
so tldrsovereignty is defined as control of territorysystem sovereignty is determined by majority control of planetsplanet control is determined by a combination of military economic and cultural influence think galactic civilizations but much simpleroutcomesmilitary blitz is still an option but is not the only optionmore options for empire building and reward groomingi have no idea if it fixes mean scary blobbing but rather its an entirely new vision in looking at sovafter some discussion here hopefully i can cross post this to assembly hallfahtim meidires
poses as bad a determinant of sovereignty as they are at least have the virtue of being structures the players want to build and use given the lack of npc civilization in 00 pc research and manufacturing is critical and that happens at poses as does the gold mine du jour of moon mining of course there are death stars for the combated systems but the core systems dont take down the poses because sovereignty is won they convert them into industrial yards in order for your vision of planetary structures to be viable in the long term you will need to make these planetary structures as attractive to build maintain and defend as poses are today you have ideas for how good they should be but i dont see any ideas for what they should do its nice to talk about planetary culture but there are literally two implementations of human beings in eve today  little spacefaring eggs and the livestock market category in order for your idea of cultural control to make sense you first have to create culture for tens of thousands of planets sure it can be simplistic and generated by computer but there still needs to be more than just planets have people for this to make any kind of sense in order for propaganda satellites to have benefits you first have to figure out what planets are good for besides convenient gravity wells so you have military economic and psychological dominion over a planet good for you what does that give you its not that this isnt an interesting idea  it very well could be but ive seen variants on it several times and nobody has yet seemed to answer the question of what precisely planets do until thats addressed this still seems like too much of a pipe dream for my liking
i agree that cultural control was the weakest component and would likely be the first to go if this transitions to the assembly hall the other two work well though high defense military satellites provide planet influence while low defense economic provide isk something like that may simplify it all all of these structures of course could killed with medium fleets the advantage to the defender is the ability to send a crapload of them into orbit maybe 20 or more with 67 military installations required to gain planet control if you deploy 20 military satellites the planet will be secure but unproductive and viceversa along the scaleorbital satellites determining planet control which then determine system sovereignty would create the layers desired by some
thanks for starting the discussion fahtim this is definitely an overall philosophical question that needs to be sorted out a couple quick thoughts for now with more to come laterit may be helpful to distinguish between sovereignty as it applies to pod pilots and that of planetary governments at present capsuleer alliances are pretty independent of dirtside politics everything we need and value is derived from inspace resources i think 00 sov is more about capsuleer sovereignty than npcs on the planets assuming they are inhabitedthe really interesting concept you brought up was how economics might play into sov that is an unexplored angle and i think something very interesting could come of that
they would generate pure isk free and clear i am about the last person in existence to worry about inflation in eve but that starts ringing inflation alarm bells in my head theres a hell of a lot of planets in 00 and putting 20 cash sources around each has the potential to thoroughly warp the monetary system youre on very thin ice here and while were on the topic ive come up with an idea for a revamp to the sovereignty system significantly less drastic than yours so i figured id mention it sov 1 one of pos sovereigntyas current system or gate sovereigntyof the style kelstin keeps championing on the assembly hall grants fuel use reductionssov 2 both of pos sovereignty and gate sovereignty grants lowend anchorableseg cynogenssov 3 as sov 2 but must also have sov 1 in all systems in the constellation grants highend anchorableseg cynojammers gate usage logging and notification sov 4 as sov 2 but must also have sov 2 in all systems in constellation and an outpost maximum one sov 4 per constellation prevents new poses from being anchored by other corps without permission prevents attacks on gate sovereignty yes it is possible for two different alliances to have sov 1 in the same system at the same time this is intentional let the raiders come in and steal the gates and itll give them some status but in order to win for real theyll have to drop dreads into the mix also the rewards for each level of sovereignty are just things that sounded good at the time dont take them too seriously  theres a reason the proposal isnt in the assembly hall
sov is ep33na lot of control is about having defacto sovereignty if you claim a territory you claim a territory no mechanism is required to show you that you own a system where you consistently kick asswith economic power theres really no way to combat a market pvper its just not happening in any meaningful wayi agree itd be fun to have some way to spray your name on a system like a graffiti artist id like to have something more to do with a medium sized gang than stare for three hours until the enemy decides theyve reached critical mass 2x enemy i wouldnt mind having something like automated miners omfg in a system that are basically like civilians a representation of your economic power and vested interest in the tidiness of your systemthe best way to implement these civilian miners i believe would be to randomly spawn freshly logged in players to 00 systems could give them mining barges or exhumers maybe even have them jetcan mine haulers production peoplewe could have an entire population of these 00 civilian miners who do nothing but produce crap and bolster the 00 economy of alliances who can keep their boarders nonporous and maintain stability for the citizens i read something somewhere about what a carebear does and it seems an awful lot like carebears could be developed into something like thisjust rambling
the civilian miners idea is really awesomeimagine it works like thisif you own a system and keep it relatively well patrolled and your miners are decently smart you gain the following benefitsthe roids in your space automagically turn into finished goods you can use to win more spacemarket activity is increased a great deal and its much easier to buysell goodsyou get a huge increase in station feesrefinery actionhowever in order to have these civilian miners you have to keep their hardship level low the following conditions will reduce their numbersthey lose a hulkthey lose faith in your ability to hold space and desert youyou impose too strict of laws on them or decide miners are ed and nuke them yourselvesremind you of anything
the problem i have with this combined posgate sov system is that an alliance that does not visit their system often can lose their status quickly also constellations should have nothing to do with sov 3 the problem with these mechanics is the effective stripping of jump bridge networks systems that are a link in a jump bridge chain often never see any local stargate traffic but that doesnt mean the system isnt being used by hundreds of alliance pilots every day you cant impose stargate control without giving the defending alliance the ability to fit defenses like sentry guns on the gates  a modest request if gates become important
editthis is what i hope to bring to the assembly hall with a few tweaks from you guyseditalso wrt the economic aspect planet npcs and isk generationmaybe the best way to look at the orbital compound is a strict military standpoint seeing as the mechanics of cultural and economic are weak in sensibility however i still think that multiple small structures at planets is better than one big structure at a moonthe deployment of small military outposts in orbit makes it easier for small groups to disable them but the sheer number of the structures makes it take a long time here are a few ideas for military orbital structuresmicro  military surveillance satellitesmall  military refueling satellitemedium orbital defense platformlarge  planetary defense headquartersmilitary surveillance satellite  can be deployed regardless of planetary control located on a small 50km grid impossible to find with astrometrics  can only be located by the deployment of your own mss scan and too small to hit with cruiserbs weapons should take 5 frigates to break shield dps allows the pinpointing of orbital defense platforms max of 5 small gunsmilitary refueling satellite  can be deployed regardless of planetary control located on a mediumsized 100km grid impossible to find with astrometrics  can only be located by an mss scan too small to hit with bs weapons should take 5 cruisers to break shield dps each refueling satellite provides fuel for 2 orbital defense platforms max of 5 medium gunsorbital defense platforms  can be deployed unless the defender has an active planetary defense headquarters locatable using astrometrics easily hit by battleship weapons should take 5 bs to break shield dps requires refueling satellites alliance with the most orbital defense platforms has control of the planet max of 5planetary defense headquarters  can be deployed when 5 orbital defense platforms are owned and no other active odp is present in orbit prevent the deployment of more odp similar defenses of a medium control tower fuel requirements 3x that of an odp max of 1 provides owner with locations of all friendly and hostile surveillance and refueling satellites without scanning if 5 friendly surveillance satellites have been deployed guns ftwinstead of the reinforcement timer each pdh and odp has 24hrs of fuel if enough refueling stations go offline these structures shields go offline starting with a pdh if present when fuel expires the deployment of new refueling satellites takes 24hrs to refuel the large structures
specific mechanics24hr timers are completely advantageous to the enemysinglegrid objectives just make for a quick tour of the system as a single blobcurrent pos mechanics basically just give us a good time and place to fight this really only measures how well a corp can win a giant fleet fightshould this represent all of what sov is i dont think so should it change hands if you leave home not reallysov currently is awarded when you win a series of pos fights as a metric of claim to territory it only means we won the battlesomething im kind of unhappy with is the ability to wear on a large power with small fights smaller objectives dont completely solve this if the objectives can be made very costly even when theyre not destroyed outright then you have a system where a noninterested party can be harassed into leaving a system they dont care abouta sovereigns economic power can be reflected in whether they make enough money to fuel the possdeal with transgressionsin the end id look for a system where its possible to cost a lot of isk to a standing power without driving them out by force if you can make it expensive to hold space that you want you can make it a straightforward decision to cede territory you dont wantof course im biased and went after these goals 100 in my thread on csm d with the midsize gang capability to reinforce a pos and the changes to fuel consumption under reinforced its much more feasible to cost an alliance enough through headaches and isk pits that they may rather pack up and acknowledge that youre more interested in the territoryon the flipside the grid divisions for pos warfare make it much more viable for that new power to defend their poss using devious tactics even if they still cant win they might make it much more costly
what if the refueling occurred when the defending alliance wanted it to that way if the refueling satellite was destroyed the odp shield would run out of fuel when they want it toa single blob could not defeat this system unless it was focused only at the main points which should be a viable way to destroy the system anyway
what i mean is unless the goals are simultaneous and on separate grids you get huge blobs yes its ridiculous to go fly after a little tiny target with a huge blob but basically thats what will happenonly way to generate interesting fights is either with rorquals on either end of an asteroid field with veld gneiss and arkonor anyway theres a reason im pushing for simultaneous goalssince a big part of lag is overview lag im pushing specifically for simultaneous goals across multiple grids
the my big question for you is why do you oppose blobs there are two different reasons but personally i think both arguments are fundamentally wrongthe first of course is to discourage huge fleet fights most proponents of this dont like the fact that if group a has more pilots of similar skill than group b group a will win the fight but this is a truth that goes beyond the context of eve sure small fleets should have an impact but a small fleet should always lose to a bigger fleet of similar shipssecond the lagbased argument against blobs i think is wrong based on principle designing a game mechanic so that it limits stress on the server isnt the right approach to solving the problem in my opinion you just have to do the best to improve the network capabilities the fact that the server has a hard time on large single grid fights shouldnt be the sole reason that youre forcing fights to occur on multiple grids
this is the heart of the matter i think the sovereignty system should discourage absentee landlordism and the way the current system links linear levels of sov with important abilities like the jump bridge results in alliance asserting that they need incredible defender advantages to maintain blanket sovereignty lest they lose one vital abilityreally i think all of these benefits should be completely separate if you want a jump bridge or a cynojammer in a system you should just be able to build it and it should be able to be attacked without having to spam or siege pos to do so while the stargate control portion of my proposal was linked to the invulnerability of tactical arrays and pos the main point was that the three elements could be established seperately if desired and that having them work together made them strongeri think sentry guns on gates could be effective and balanced given the proper rules  make them cheap enough that they can be reasonably destructable make them only fire on pilots with aggression towards the alliance that anchored them and limit how many can be anchored on a gate then theyd be a valuable assist for defenders protecting their territory but also attackable infrastructure if the defender isnt around and an alliance could maintain an engineer corps to keep their sentry gun emplacements operablebut the key point here is that the concrete benefits a territory holding alliance receives should be based on actions appropriate to the type of benefit outpost construction would be rightly based on having pos infrastructure to support it but cynojammers and jump bridges being based on how many pos you have in system is silly especially because they grant such a huge advantage in the subcapital arena without having to set foot in that arena in the first place
i dont oppose bringing more ships and thereby having more muscle but a giant fleet battle with lots of lag overview or serverside negates to a great extent whether or not blob a is more skilled than blob b when dictors are dropping bubbles 200km off target the fight is almost down to luck of the draw its this randomness that im againsti would prefer there to be simultaneous objectives across several grids as a method of increasing the impact skill and tactics has on the outcome of a battle on face value it seems a lot harder to manage a fight effectively when its happening in multiple locations but welcome to the real world a multigrid battle will cause fcs of true genius to rise to the top far outstripping the capabilities of larger groups with less effective commandas we are conditioned to the game as it is we look at a multigrid fight like but but i dont want to divide my forces this is symptomatic of the oversimplified field of combat weve inherited from the early days of eve those who can adapt will move forward those with real cunning will have more decisive impact in the end warfare will be much more exciting and we will all benefit
how warm are you to the idea of subcap gangs being able to reinforce a pos and thus exposing the benefits gained through sov to maintaining defacto control over the midsize gang warfare
i totally agree but the solution must be by improving server capability or by streamlining clientserver communications changing a game mechanic because the server cant handle it and designing the new one around server capabilities is wrong and i hope ccp would agree it is against their morals as game designers
they can bs fleets are entirely subcap and can destroy a pos
if sovereignty is independent from the ability to have pos anchorables then the only benefit point of holding sov is having your name on a map and a small fuel benefit
its a fundamental reality that has no workaround sending ship data is an nbody problem if there are n ships you have to send n ships locations to n clients thus telling clients simply how to display what is going on will scale load exponentially performance increases naturally will gain less and less real increase and get harder to achievea battle that happens across several grids or a battle that happens in several systems between midsize gangs trying to ninjareinforce poss wont seem any less epic especially when you listen to several teams in alliance chat all encountering and dealing with their own challenges while you struggle to make headway at your own objective
so there can be no fundamental objection to a process that can already take place score one for towers getting reinforced via the arrays not that you ever said you were againstwondering when i can win your thumbs up on csm
but as a defender i wouldnt be stupid enough to separate my assets but rather would place them all together i wouldnt let my arrays be separated to my own forces would be split and i wouldnt let my pos kill itself if nobody was actually shooting itfurthermore once the pos shields go down i would still blob my control tower to protect the armor and structure so it doesnt even really solve the problem
no it makes no sense to me that a pos go into reinforced without being directly attacked its capabilities can be reduced until all the arrays are destroyed but the pos itself shouldnt go down
you have to remember im not treating the array as a simple addon structures the arrays are additional paths to the pos attackers and defenders have ways to influence what happens at the tower via the arrays its not like youre attacking something thats entirely separate from the pos arrays are indeed part of the pos if you want to forgo involvement you simply opt not to install arrays and instead make your towers much more vulnerable to traditional conquest methods just went through this in detail over in my proposal threadby having their own stront timers that do not eat all the stront when they come out of reinforced the arrays should almost never be destroyed theyre essentially a permanent fixture unless youre very lazy with refueling of the pos warfare until the tower is either saved or brought downfrom my point of view such a design characteristic is unavoidable if multigrid combat is to be a goal if the objectives can be treated as isolated they will get blobbed one by one they have to have some protection stront timer is like a timeout from total annihilation until the fight is completely over they have to have ways of being brought back into the fight to stay relevantsince bandwidth for fleet battles is an nbody problem i believe multigrid combat should be a goal
to be honest that is preferable to gaining some of these huge tactical advantages simply through pos warfare in particular the ability to drop a huge gang on top of an enemy roaming force using the jump bridge is very powerful and all the more so because long term the roaming subcap gang cant attack the infrastructure that makes the jump bridge possible in a reasonable waybut to your point there is also the capital shipyards and outpost benefits that ought still to be related to pos construction not to mention the normal functions of pos
forgive me for continuing to derail but what do you think of arrays as a requisite for jumpbridgecyno deploymentthis would expose an alliances infrastructure for dealing with a roaming threat to that roaming threat since a gang of domis can reinforce a pos using arrays in a reasonable frame of time its immediately possible for a successful roaming campaign to divide an alliance and deny them easy transport if they cant deal with even a small gang
what im saying is that holding sov should prevent others from deploying cyno jammers and jump bridges in your space you have to be able to restrict the build up of enemy infrastructure with some sort of defense thats why pos works
naturally it would take time to respond to a small gang so as a defender i would make sure such an important piece of logistics would be amply defended so that it takes a long time to disablesure there could be more requisites to having a cynojammer or jupmbridge but i still dont like your reasons for why they have to be off grid the metareason for lag is in my mind the wrong reason and the ingame reason is too artificial for my liking
what im saying is that holding sov should prevent others from deploying cyno jammers and jump bridges in your space you have to be able to restrict the build up of enemy infrastructure with some sort of defense thats why pos worksunder the system i proposed with stargate control as an element you could not attack arraystyle anchored outside of pos jump bridge or cynojammers without punching a hole in the local stargate network what i found ideal about a system like that was that stargate control was an indicator of local activity and presence unlike pos construction and at the same time it allowed you to move portions of the tactical infrastructure outside of the pos to separate them from pos warfare i think its a good example of how a layered system is superior to the one trick pony of pos warfare in a layered system you have greater flexibility both defensively and offensivelywhat it keeps coming back to is the absentee landlordism of straight up pos construction it conveys powers beyond the scope of what it deserves
artificial gravity tide capture is an amazing source of energyits not really all that farfetched basically there are a lot of processes in space even simple ones like solar wind that if harvested across a long distance using a field established between to objects separated by a good distance can provide a large amount of highquality energythe metareason is 100 sound either do something thats not built around poss that requires multiple simultaneous objectives or give me thumbs upthere is simply no way around the fact that 1000 pilots on one grid means 1000 ships being sent data on 1000 other ships i said earlier that anything is possible with software not 100 true in this case no matter what you do a large fleet battle on one grid is going to mean a huge amount of bandwidth necessary it gets worse as battles scale up so there is no room for eve to have more players in the same space in the futurewithout something some game mechanic or piece of infrastructure to eventually manage multigrid fights in a way that is meaningful the life of eve will slowly run out this is about lifetime of the gang the devs have to recognize it its inevitable and must be dealt with
my pos runs on fuel because in a sandbox game i dont want arrays if they decentralize my vulnerable assets if the gravity tides only produce energy id rather use an alternative source and pay for it im against changing game mechanics because of metalevel problemsmy sovereignty proposal has nothing to do with a single pos it is all about orbital structureseventually even the multigrid fights will get too big you would have to keep adding layers upon layers
i will say i dont like one relationshippos moons are sov tools and moonmining toolsseparation of moon mining and sov i would like saya series of battle stations out in lagrange points you use them to control the ability to field poss thus the defacto ruler of the system determines who uses the resources but without the fuelhogging pos spam crap getting needlessly entangled with others wishes to produce the fruits of the systemi have supported something like this in the pastin a utopian feature request world this is what we talk about in discussions like this eh i would go for this1 poss are infrastructure you deploy for economic purposes to perform the rites of building supercaps and harvesting moon goop2 tactical arrays are the multigrid battle coordination devices that enforce a need to be very quick and able to manage conflicts at several locations they are also the basis of infrastructure used to hold and defend the system3 player owned infrastructure that can be granted by the holder of tactical arrays and allow occupants of a system to exploit the systems riches in a more passive manner without giving them the strategic capabilities of the station and tactical arraysyes feudalism at its best you can grant services to your serfs at driveby windows in the castle wall will raise 00 population and improve 00 life moons mining will no longer be sovholding pos related affair pos spam at worthless moons will no longer be necessary
stargate control becomes a game of tennis furthermore your system prevented any sort of imperial control where pilots fought on front lines and colonies are left to themselves on their existing defenses colonies can include systems with valuable moons and isolated systems as part of a jump bridge network
perfect include this in the orbital structure idea where oribtal defense platforms and planetary defense headquaters be deployed at lagrange pointspos are infrastructureplanetary control determines sovereignty
tennis ping pong etc are poor analogies for what would actually happen defenders would only have to respond to actual attacks on their territory  a perfectly just scenario an expanding power can simply choose to ignore contesting of their interior stargates unless they are in a key system and return to shore up their network at a more convenient time i think giving a free pass to the unattended interior of an empire simplo because it is inconvenient for a territorial power to bother to defend it is very wrongwhat it comes down to is that i think a territorial power should have to respond to small scale attacks within their territory in the same way any real life power would the current system allows them to ignore their territory resulting in huge swaths of uninhabited but somehow claimed space that should change

okay so a few know you were created to represent the player base  forward ideasconcerns to ccp yet i have some questions for every one of you on the councilhow long have you been involved with the game  have you been here through most of the major changes what race of ships can you pilot what have you installed in place to make sure all proposals put forward are looked at in an unbiased manner what guarantees do we have that any changes are not purely beneficial to only yourselves or your current corp  alliance what is your main bulk of eve time spent doing  ie pvp pve manufacturing invention etcthis may have already been asked before  if so why wasnt it stickied and why am i interested in knowing the above  because this will help myself and others know from what experience you are drawing from when having discussions or putting ideas forwardi look forward to your replies
most of this info can be found in our campaign threads phow long have you been involved with the game  have you been here through most of the major changes ive been actively playing since january 2007 and yes i know this makes me the youngest player on the csm by a large margin even i have not been here for some of the major changes but i have talked a lot about it with people who were i find the way eve has developed and changed very interestingwhat race of ships can you pilot all t1 frigs and cruisers and most caldari noncapital shipswhat have you installed in place to make sure all proposals put forward are looked at in an unbiased manner csm members keep pretty close eyes on eachother and watch out for bias that may occur what guarantees do we have that any changes are not purely beneficial to only yourselves or your current corp  alliance the fact that the csm is made up out of very different players and player factions even if something would be highly beneficial to my corp if it isnt good for the game the rest can still block it and i would toowhat is your main bulk of eve time spent doing  ie pvp pve manufacturing invention etchelping out in eve university and recently a lot of low sec exploration
what she saidthere is a ton of information available on those threads although i did notice a few weeks ago that links to campaign pages are in a few instances no longer working however spending even 2 minutes researching a csm member should get you all the answers you could ever need and morei suspect the reason the info isnt stickied is because most people who have been paying attention to the csm read those threads at the time of the election when we were deciding who to vote forit annoyed me in the campaigns and it still annoys me now  lazy people asking generic questions addressed to all the reps when the info is already there if they could only be bothered to look for itah  please flame me for posting on a thread intended for csm answers when im not on the csm it will make me cry destroy all my stuff and ragequit well done

cloaks are fine the way they are why do people insist on saying they are overpowered when they were introduced prenerfed to hell and back and havent changed imho if you cant catch a cloaker in your space then you shouldnt be in nullsec a bubble and an instalock ceptor and the cloaker dies simple easy gaurenteed ive done it and can do it i use both cloaks and i hunt cloakers its not that hard you just dont want to have to put the effort into itfor example if the guy you are hunting is in a raven in the belt at say 60km he sees you cloaks he cant warp cant lock cant reload cant activate mods and cant hardly move all you have to do is set a course in his general direction and if you are in a ceptor you should be able to decloak him as hes only capable of approximately 2530msso to say again there is nothing wrong with cloaks they are just fine the way they are and they work just as intendedregards maabuss
an interesting idea ill see if i can work it into the final document 
edit i missed your pdf link before you addressed several points i was going to makevery good ideas a couple of thoughtsregarding bounties there needs to be a way to prevent the hunted player from interfering with or even benefit from the arrangement for example id want to make sure that the bounty payoff plus insurance was not enough to make it worthwhile for the hunted player to benefit by suiciding themselves to his own alt to this end the bounty payment amount per kill should be worth no more than about half of the full insurance value of the target and the the maximum insurance payment for the destroyed ship should be reduced by the same amount in the case of t2faction ships this should probably be bumped to several times the full insurance amount note that modules need not be included in the ship valuation since the hunter will get about half of the modules as loot treat this as a bonus incentivesome thought needs to be given to how large a bounty can be set the current limit of one kill is too little and theres incentive for the hunted to sacrifice a cheap ship to cancel the bounty but if killing the hunted is more or less unlimited as in your plan then there is potential for griefing perhaps the limit should be a multiple of the value of the ship loss that created the kill right to begin withregarding the merc contracts this is an interesting idea it might be worthwhile to simplify this idea to a contract type filed by either the merc or the entity trying to hire mercs that automatically files for and funds the wardec and ensures the payment of contracted amounts similar to your plan but without the requirement that the hiring entity be involved directly in a war another interesting question relating to this is whether or not the contract should be public once accepted
yes

when abulation is out by all that is holy make it be this year planetary fligt would be awesome if you could actualy do something in there not just flykilling npcs of course but blowing up planetary npc bases that shoot back at you or blowing your enemy alliances base to pieces while it launches fighters at u would be realy nicealso why not be able to dockland in your friendly planetary bases and walk around in it as ambulation charplanets also open up a whole new form of industry i bet there are more elements then just atmosfaric gases and cadmium on those thingsmaybe there are uranuim to be mined using planetare mining facility thingy and then brought up to pos to be enriched enriched uranium ofc being the stuff u put in pos
lalala ankhs gone madokay not really this is just a compilation of all the creative garbage floating around in my head but why not post it and hope it will distil into something useful dont take it too seriously but instead see if you can salvage some useful parts of it and incorporate it into different things if you think it is promising well id love to hear that too of courseagents in 00 alliance spacesurely it must have been a highsec carebear coming up with this kind of rambling but read on anyway there are outposts floating around in 00 so why no agents wouldnt it be possible to have agents from the npc factions settle on these stations and provide means to get unique standing combinations and special loyalty point rewards why couldnt alliances work towards building relations with the npc factions and have the agent standing payouts reflect this so if the goons would have built up ties with the amarr and minmatar but are somehow hostile to gallente and ore the standings of people running missions for goon agents would be shifted accordingly roleplayers would love this and if cva for example would be nice to amarr and at least neutral to gallente i would personally prefer to visit 00 and run missions for them instead of my regular highsec agentsbut enough of that it gets better what about player created missions eve is supposed to be a playerdriven universe thus player action should affect the environment in a meaningful way agents could act as mediator for alliances and hand out rewards for actions set by the alliance command im sure some of you have played ultima online where players could hire npc vendors to put in their house to sell stuff on their behalf well that type of facilitator npcmissions types could include scout obtaining the locations of x poses belonging to enemy corp y agent would handle a database of known enemy pos locations to this purpose raid get pos x in system y in reinforced mode siege the destruction of pos x in system y search and destroy the destruction of x enemy ships haul move items from x to y acquire gather x minerals and deliver them at station y produce produce specific item x y times and deliver them at station z defend ensure that poses in system x remain unmolested for y hours patrol score x kills in specific systems only escort make sure ship x gets from y to z unmolestedalliances could specify the reward for players undertaking these efforts and even reward standing loyalty points and consequently set up their own lp shop and yet to be implemented things such as medals and rank points i believe this would result in more player initiative and when the alliance chooses to open up the agents which can also have standing requirements the chance for mercenaries and opportunists to participate in 00 warfare it also provides a direct measurable way to determine how much a player has been contributing to the allianceof course these missions could also be tied into the sovereignty system with repeated successes making a system vulnerable like factional warfare and a dynamic objective spawning that will ultimately result in the conquest of the system like blockade secure all stargates in this system for x hoursokay that was it for now i also had some ideas with players owning small anchorable structures and being able to store small quantities of stuff there and call it home and also have small production facilities to produce trade goods such as soil livestock holoreels and that sort of stuff and that these trade goods would be consumed by the outposts improving their quality which results in them looking shinier in ambulation with more bars and other facilities opening up and also more and better npc agents being attracted feel free to expand on this
i like the idea of player made missions but they are more like contracts really for example if i despise an allaince enough i could basically put a bounty on their head but being more specific like kill x amount of ships mineral value so they dont suicide shuttle and put up a cash prize sorta thing for the first groupcorpalliance to accomplsh it and maybe some reputation points or somethingalso with the possibility of transferred killrights you can just pawn it off to the highest bidder sorta thing maybe i dunno too many details and a lot of work would have to be done to implement itbut it would make this game damn fun for mercs and the like
i honestly dont care about the type of mission but something needs to be done about npc sov being massively better than true 00 and this is a step in the right direction
how is ccp screwing over hardcore players by not implementing this the game have been around for 5 years or so and the proposed changes by the op havent been in the game yet there are hardcore players as it is there are still l3 and l4 agents in lowsec just as there are l3 and l4 agents in highsec the onlyone getting screwed by these changes are those players that dont want to be forced to low or nullsec to do l3 or l4 missions not those that are already in low or nullsec also i keep seeing how hardcore players are being screwed over by farmers and how these players bunk all the players that isnt doing what they are doing into the farmers category someone that is casual about this game and run 2 or 3 missions per session isnt a farmer it would be like saying that the hardcore players are farming kills by sitting at a gatecamp players are farming isklootwhatever by being online 10 hours a day neither is true as the way people play the game is different for everyone
id love it personally however the remaining high sec populace that did not ragequit will either mine or whine
terrible ideano reason to make the 00 spaceholding megaalliances even more rich and the other peoples cut off from lvl4 missionsu have missions there if u want to have more lvl4 u can move free to the empireu have moons for mining high end minerals in belts good ratting possibilities officer spawns faction spawns valuable plexesif u dont like the way than give up your space and go back to empire
i prefer the suggestion of dynamic agent quality to break up the laggy mission hubs but theres a gross imbalance between individual isk making opportunities in 00 lowsec and highsec and so any suggestion of correcting this is worthy of supportfix ur game ccp
great ideaif you want to make isk buying more of a problem reduce ccps subscriptions reduce ccps profits and make eve less appealing to new playersps poasting in a thread started by someone in the same alliance as the people that got suicide ganking nerfed and made macroers and isk sellers safer
an hour you really should stop exaggerating malc it makes you look like a liar
not supportedyou are forgetting that the casual mission runner does only one or two l4 missions a day if he does l4s at all as most of them seem to be doing l3s because l4s are too hard for them and earn 15 million per hour not the exaggerated 20 million figures some people claim they can squeeze out of l4smissions are not that much of a goldmine unless you got a marauder or other ship with several billions in fittings and thats only a tiny fraction of the playersi am all for bigger mission rewards in lowsec00 though as they currently are not worth the effort see faction warfare missions i dont see anyone doing those either
give that i can  and i dont care what you say its both true and unexceptional  make 2025m in an hour buying a 1618m isk implant is not challenging
why would people who can only run 1 mission a day be bothered about perdiem mission limits
that would not necessarily be a concern for this type of player but the ops proposal to effectively remove level 3 and 4 agents from highsec alltogether would be problematic for them
why

to give you ccps ideas on thisthat was by wrangler incidentally
ratting you first have to be in a system with true sec good enough to spawn triple 11m or better battle ships chain them in each belt wait for respawns hope people dont mess up your chains if you have more than one person ratting in the system you have to hope you get a belt with rats in them missions you can do it with a raven easily you do not have to worry about much they can service as many people as have standings that can you them you can get the standing quite fast with the skills and the cosmos turn ins
you do not need a marauder or a faction ship to do the missions you can do them with a normal raven and best named or tech two gear they have insignificant risk compared to the reward
i disagree with this proposal though i agree with the basic premise the problem as i see it is that lowsec offers no incentive to draw population unless you are in fw or are a pirate miners and missionrunners suffer enormous risk for marginal if any benefit so instead of nerving the stuffing out of empire dwellers id like to see lowsec earnings buffedfor mining increase the value of ore in low sec systems instead of adding some flat increase which may or may not be enough to offer the desired incentive implement a dynamic adjustment for example each downtime the server checks lowsec belts against their capacity each belt that is relatively untouched over 90 of capacity has a few highergrade roids added to the belt  which last until mined but dont respawn except by the mechanic abovefor missions dramatically increase the adjustment to mission rewards based on system security add a small possibility of faction spawns in lowsec missions eliminate the drone loophole to probing missionrunners change the npc ai so that interlopers share aggro from mission spawns to prevent the missionrunner from being penalized if attacked in the mission
i think low sec and 00 need a boost low sec like you said has no real reason and 00 for mining is not as good as people think because of the massive value veld has over many other ores also ratting is not as good as mission running and you can not run missions from outposts so people dont even have the option its mining or ratting and neither of them are as good or reliable

i would like the csms to address the issue in which probes lose ownershipunder the current system all exploration recon and survey probes lose ownership under the following situations1 dock up2 leave the system3 exiting or quitting eve4 disconnection5 very rare lag out but not disconnect in which the server thinks you have disconnected you have engaged the emergency warp but the client maintains a connection6 client crash7 downtimeone two three and seven are not the issue however four five and six areone of the things eve has that i do enjoy is exploration in some systems you have to deploy upward of ten probes to cover the entire system these probes can cost anywhere from 5000 to 15000 isk these are just exploration probes if you are surveying a system for moon mining you can deploy upward of 50 probes if youre fast enough each costing between 90000 and 195000 iskthe loss due to technical fault on ccps behalf is not recoverable after a petition i was told by a gm that there is no record of the probes launched in the system so ccp is unable to reimburse the loss of probesunder the current system you could lose anywhere between 5000 isk and 10000000 isk depending on what youre doing for ccp to say sorry we have no record of that is just not acceptableforget about the cost for a second consider the other factor here timeit doesnt matter what type of probing you are doing it takes time to find whatever youre doing moon surveying can take hours for a single system exploration can take just as long recon probe can take under a minute so were talking about the loss of time as wellwe now have two scales5000 isk to 10000000 isk60 seconds to three hoursweve all seen how ccp wants to incorporate probing more for faction wars to get complexesded space where faction and officer items are all the way to building t2 items however this simple but highly annoying bug doesnt make people want to spend the time and effortmoon probes are probably meant to be an isk sink for ccp however with the risk of losing near 10 million isk multiple times people will not use the gaze survey probes theyll use the quest survey probespeople want to explore but they sure dont want to have to keep on deploying between four and ten probes every time the server chooses to boot you offnow for the last piece when you get disconnected the probes remain in space they do not disappear exploration probes will remain for over an hour if you disconnect when deploying so now you not only have the lost ownerships probe taking up cpudatabase time you also have the new probe you where forced to deploy againonce in a system with a lot of lag i had 42 probes deployed but could only use 7 of them thirty five objects in the database sitting there for an hour doing nothing just taking up space because i was disconnected five times i was even unable to destroy them because i was not the ownerthis needs to be fixed if you emergency warp your probes should remain your until you either destroy them or they expire or from the list above one two three and six happens
no record of probes launched lets get this fixed i have yet to go into probes but its a field i would like to start in the next 36 months
has ccp ever released a schematic detailing the components interconnects and topology of their server farm perhaps if they could provide more details some of the smart people that play eve and have it experience could offer advicewould that be asking too much let the people who suffer from the lag help find the solution something other than keep out of that system

solid arguments very well thought out
anything that makes each and every module and rig in the game a viable alternative is fantasticthis also should apply to modules like a shield recharger since it is almost always better to simply add shield extenders and flux coils or pdus than waste a mid slot on something less useful when the mids are the most valuable slot to a shield tank

weve already had a load of threads about mission running but this issue has not yet been raised so ill do that this weekfor those that have not yet read this there was a dev blog on mission running a while ago it is an interesting read and provides for a little discussionthere are a several issues with missions that get echoed in many threads and the discussions ingame and the emails sent to me so ill raise them here1 missions need to be made more dynamic and unpredictable2 mission payout in lowsec and 00 needs improvement3 module loot has a negative impact on the economy by making t1 production obsolete and injecting too many minerals into the economy4 missions in factional warfare require improvements5 mining missions require improvements6 agents are static resulting in overloaded mission hubs desire to have agent quality made dynamic7 level 4 missions in their current form do not belong in highsecurity space8 standing is being monopolized by missions no ways to get standing outside of mission running with the exception of fw standingmissions need to be made more dynamic and unpredictablecurrent mission design is static and repetitive players can look up the mission summary on various websites and know exactly what to expect while the problem will be alleviated somewhat with the introduction of new missions in the empyrian age 11 patch and beyond which causes players to get the same missions less frequently the problem remains that the player will eventually know what to expectthe solution to these problems would be to introduce dynamic content missions could be pieced together from random elements have random ship spawns and variable objectives another solution would be random bonus content that goes beyond the mission objective the mission would be completed but like in the angel extravaganza mission the player has the option to go through yet another gate to get to a bonus room these bonuses would appear randomly in missions and will not appear in every missionmission payout in lowsec and 00 needs improvementcurrently not many people run missions in lowsec00 because the rewards are not that much better than highsec while there are often significant risks attached perceived or not i think that the mission rewards could get a positive adjustment also if dynamic missions are implemented as above then certain ship spawns or bonuses could be exclusive to lowsec00
module loot has a negative impact on the economy by making t1 production obsolete and injecting too many minerals into the economyat first i was all  dont mess with mission income  towards this point but i have done a lot of reading and research on this topic and it cannot be denied that income from missions is much better than from mining minerals yourself this invalidates the miner profession in addition due to the looted modules the production of most t1 modules is unprofitablewhile i do not think that reducing mission income is a good move due to the fact that many mission runners are just casual players that already have a hard time making isk it should be possible to shift mission income away from modules and instead deliver either more loyalty points or through items such as dogtags or other token drops that can be traded in for various rewardsmissions in factional warfare require improvementsseveral issues with these particular missions ship spawns inside these missions are often bigger than the class of ship that is allowed entry making them quite difficult to complete in mediumfitted ships and flying anything expensive generally is not a good idea in fw space they are also often quite a distance away from the agent risking gatecamps and it is generally easy for the opposing faction to intrude and disrupt these missions due to them being visible on the overview and the difficult nature of the mission itselfdue to these difficulties it is impossible to do these missions without a group of players however the rewards of the missions are extremely low and even more so if they have to be shared by a whole group the penalty for failure is harsh however while the risk of failing is extremely highin short these missions need to be reduced in difficulty have an increase in reward andor have the penalty for failure lowered significantlymining missions require improvementsthese missions are extremely boring and yield significantly less income than mining the veldspar outside and thus need a boost in reward and be made somewhat more interesting not much needs to be said i thinkagents are staticvarious suggestions have been made in this aspect one is to adjust agent quality based on the amount of mission runners knocking on the agents door each day so that outoftheway agents eventually offer more compared to the ones in crowded hubs like motsu this mechanic would also immediately yield improvements to lowsec mission agents since these are not frequented by playersthe holy grail would of course be to have agents appear and disappear based on events in game such as backstory and the result of player efforts in factional warfare which would bring a dynamic universe one step closer
level 4 missions in their current form do not belong in highsecurity spacewith this issue it is hard to determine if this stems from whining and intollerance towards a certain playstyle by a vocal minority or actual valid game concerns i think that a lot of valid concerns will be addressed through points 2 3 and 6 i personally do not think that elimination of level 4 missions from highsec alltogether will be a valid solution and that doing so will not accomplish the goal of bringing more people into lowsec as this type of player will either resort to other income in highsec mining lower level missions or quit the game alltogether i think the way to address this is by giving players incentives to go to lowsec such as factional warfare and increased profibility there instead of these attempts to force people outstanding is being monopolized by missionsthere currently is no way to get standing outside of running missions with the introduction of factional warfare however it was made possible to acquire standing through the capture of fw sites it would be nice to see more of these systems put in place so players can engage in different activities to raise their standingsanything i missed
general announcement 1just to clear it up guys i do not necessarily support all these positions myself most notably the one to remove all l4s from highsec however these are missionrelated issues that are repeatedly brought up on the forum and in game i could easily have painted a onesided picture only featuring happy dancing carebear mission runners and without taking into account the industry mining and even lowsec hugger side of things but in doing that id ignore the fact that as csm i have to be open to all aspects and work towards making eve as a whole more enjoyable not just attempt to boost my own playstylethis is also how i came to the conclusion that the mineral input from mission loot is a bit outof line compared to miners all aspects of eve always are tiedin to other aspects just like a reallife economy however to make it even more complicated i do not think that nerfing mission income is the right approach if we keep casual players in mind that is why i think the solution may be found in shifting mission income to other sources im open to suggestions as to what these sources might be i already suggested loyalty points and tags as examples and in dynamic mission content there might be a chance for a rarer module drop or rare decorative crappolia to put on your desk in ambulation whatever just thinking of things you should do the same moving all level 4s to lowsec in my opinion hell no never however this issue has been brought up many times and apparently there are players that feel strongly about it if we get to hear ccps stance on it and that does not have to take an afwul lot of time then at least these vocal players get to hear ccps stance and reasons you do not have to support all these items yourself you have to support the discussion of these items and as a csm i do not mind discussing issues i do not necessarily agree onthis thread is to support some discussions on the matter until its brought up for voting in next weeks csm meeting and ill try to incorporate your feedback into my document if it gets voted throughthanks
i absolutely support the concept that missions need to be made more varied dynamic and intersting fewer smarter rats with more realistic fits using tactics that would encourage players to use fits closer to modern pvp setups and require greater player skill would go a long way to solving many of the problems of misisonrunningwhen they require full attention cant be semiafk farmed arent so easy that a 3 month old in a raven can solofarm them virtually risklessly arent utterly predictable then well see a lot fewer complaints about them wherever theyre locatedmake pve more challenging more interesting more fun and eve overall will be betteredit and when if mission fit requirements change so that mission ships arent faction pinatas then missioners wont have quite so much to fear from pirates frankly its crazy that the mission fits required to kill npc pirates leave one defenceless against player pirates i dislike carebearism in all its forms but fairness dictates that they should at least expect a fighting chance
grr 
smart move the way i see the situation is that lowsec00 missions need a boost but not very significant the thing that needs to be done is nerf lvl4 missions in hisec some people have clarified out whats the problem its hisec lvl4 missions has way too high reward vs risk ratio compared to lowsec00 missionsedit not too high but higher
mission rewards were not a problem early last week and have only been a problem sinse the suicide gankers and their speed lover allys made them a problem how a csm can not see this i dont know but for sure bandwagons spring to my mind
i support making the mission system more dynamicas the demand for missions from an agent the potential reward for the missions should diminish in accordance to the laws of supply and demand it stands to reason that as the high priority missions are completed an agent would have to hand out the less lucrative ones equally if the availability of people willing to take on missions is low then agent would have to improve the reward to entice pilots

depends there is nothing wrong with knowing the content of a mission some are still very hard mordus headhunters wc ae bonus room in the midst of deadspace 15 enemies abound i think it is 55 not sure etcif missions are made random this makes it impossible to determine if a mission is 1 possible and 2 worth doing which makes it a particular problem for less skilled chars or people with worse shipsfittingshaving to use pvp setups no just no some people dont like nanoging everything and having to do 3478234723894789ms and pvp setups have such crap tanks that it would make harder missions impossible without a blobmeh whatever doubt this will cause people to go to lowsec and run missions but even if one person does and then gets killed by pirates it will reduce their whining so do iti am for removing t1 loot it is a huge pain to loot due to large size and then have to sort through it to reprocess remember than named loot only comes from missions thoughi am not a rper i couldnt care less about fw do whateveryesyoure right there are plenty of other mmos around eve has plenty of problems aready making it unenjoyable too will just mean people will find anothermining missions faction warfare for the rpersno support due to above pointsedit for formatting and a correction
maybe yea i should it was a bit of a an inconvenient truth and as we know truth and politics dont belong with each otherok constructive side of thingsjust change recyle rates on dropped modules maybe the npc used them to hard so they will lose 50 materialslvl4 missions in high is okthe high level missions are already in low but lets make it that on lvl4s you have to pay concord a  of pay to help protecton the basis concord were payback but the speed they arrive now it can be seen as protection nowyou and on top of that you pay concord a bounty for any ships they kill trying to gank youbase the payment on size of ships aggessing and the size protecting ie 10k for a riter attacking a raven right up to 15million for a raven atacking a raventhen if concord fail the victim get 90 of ship cost and module loss
id be careful about adjusting mission pay downwards even in the form of minerals lp prices are fairly flexible and tag pricesespecially for pirate tags are massively flexible so neither is an especially good way of replacing mineral drops the only commodity big enough to take the jump from what i can tell is isk itself and even that would bring on inflation concerns also for the love of god dont eliminate highsec l4 missions youd destroy the game make lowsec and 00 missions better sure but highsec should stay asis at least in the broad strokes
1 missions need to be made more dynamic and unpredictableagreed to an extent maybe having multiple versions of the same mission and it randomly selects which one you get would be feasible but everything else you are asking for is pretty hardcore2 mission payout in lowsec and 00 needs improvementagreed the actual isk payment needs to be adjusted minimally but the lp rewards on offer should be desireable and unobtainable from empire lp stores give people a reason to use the low sec00 agents3 module loot has a negative impact on the economy by making t1 production obsolete and injecting too many minerals into the economystandard t1 loot should imho be removed from mission drops and named gear drops should be uncommon in the scale of commonuncommonrare why not have the only thing drop as loot other than nonstandard gear being faction specific tags that have no value except for cashing in with your agent for isk or specific lp  mission tag items brings back mining as a profession and makes t1 production viable again 4 missions in factional warfare require improvementsdont do it myself but my spies reliably inform me this would be a good thing5 mining missions require improvementstheyre boring just like mining is  not sure what the issue is really6 agents are static resulting in overloaded mission hubs desire to have agent quality made dynamicpersonally i think dynamic agent quality is going to fail for the same reason static complexes did but ill be happy to be proved wrong7 level 4 missions in their current form do not belong in highsecurity spaceeh what you talkin about willis8 standing is being monopolized by missions no ways to get standing outside of mission running with the exception of fw standingyou used to be able to buy back standing through bribesedit supporting the fact that missions need a look at overall  just dont agree with all the points prolly shoould split them up into multiple issues
i like the idea of diversifying missions to make them more interesting and dynamic instead of the you vs blob current version lower the number of npcs make them harder make their drops better but remove the basic tech 1 stuff and raise the bountys accordinglymissions need to have the highest payout in lowsec they can be farmed in relative safety in 0 of done correctly and supported by an alliance so making them pay huge sums in 0 wont fix anything not to mention that most npc corporations are going to have much more interest in making low sec more secure before they concern themselves with 0 so they would offer the most incentive in lowseci would love to see roid belts in high sec removed completely and replaced with mining missions only this would slow the roll of the macro miners because they couldnt park in belt for a few hours at a time this would direct more miners to low sec and 0 in search of better mining without completely eliminating empire mining it would also force flippers and gankers to search for prey a little more than just flying from belt to belt
fixed it for you
while you clearly did made a good points however i dont dispute any of themi agree about the income and slightly boring nake asteroids mining mission channel know this joke very well i am still waiting for the mining mission to be add to the index the reason i ask for adding to index since no one really oppose it other than miner should stay in asteroid belt rofl of course we dont want the income to be too much do we cough macro coughmining mission linkage
im surprised youre willing to take such a bold stance as to even discuss reducing the profitability of level 4s in highsec i think that its an issue that needs to be addressed regardless
no l4 missions in high sec no loot and the price of 60 day gtc is not the best combination for the eve player
thumbs up to all
thumbs up
1 missions need to be made more dynamic and unpredictablemeh this is really about adding content and redirecting priorities for me to support what you say here youd have to explain what you are transfering content priority fromif this was spend less time on walking expansions more time making mission content im all in favour but there are higher priority issues throughout the internet spaceships parts of eve2 mission payout in lowsec and 00 needs improvementyes yes it does3 module loot has a negative impact on the economy by making t1 production obsolete and injecting too many minerals into the economyyes on the first part not so much on the second part4 missions in factional warfare require improvementsthey require improvements in the sense that large parts of the eve community shouldnt be arbitarily banned from them beyond that i cant comment5 mining missions require improvementsdont mine dont know6 agents are static resulting in overloaded mission hubs desire to have agent quality made dynamicagree completely7 level 4 missions in their current form do not belong in highsecurity spacepersonally i think the real issue is that l4 missions pay out too much in high sec this is the trade off with point 28 standing is being monopolized by missions no ways to get standing outside of mission running with the exception of fw standingagree but probably not a priorityso i can agree with you on 48
i agree as for the highseclowsecnullsec problem maybe have an equal number of agents in highsec and lowsec and increase the differential in rewards that sec status brings
there are already more agents in lowsec so i support an increase to equal numbers
well yeahnow i am not saying keep mining missions as they are just that the current form of mining is way to easy and profitable for macro miners i would be happy to see mining missions yield larger quantities of the existing ores as your agent level goes up so that the reward is very similar to mining except that it takes more interaction on the part of the minerof course if your a macro miner you would be upset or even leave if you take the belts out of empire and make them have to actually play the game i dont see a problem with all those people closing their accounts at allso would you be among the ranks of those who would be upset or leave ethaet
in many ways we should be happy that there are macrominers as its pretty much the only positive side of mining when you compare it to missioning the veld prices would have to increase a lot to compete
i spent my first year of eve mostly in low sec fighting pirates and doing missions rewards for low sec stuff was a little bit higher than high sec back then i never lost a ship during that time simply because we formed up a local antipirate milita that was very effective we were not solo players like todays mission runners are so what stops this nowadays1 risk vs reward low sec does not give enough reward to make it worthwhile for most people to go there in fact its mostly pvperspirates that run low sec lvl4slvl5 solution  massive lowsec00 mission lp boosts before you say ah that boosts pirates alts who are the only people who run them remember that the more lucrative they become the more likely pirates are in running protection rackets and taking protection money from mission runners who want access in other words people will be giving money to pirates to avoid being hassled in addition to the extra targets so risk vs rewards is certainly there2 the total lack of grouped missions which destroys player confidence to enter lowsec basically all high sec missions are mostly solo affairs rather than being something that would excite people into bringing more people to help solution  not sure perhaps more high buffer or high hp npcs that give a decent reward but make it more exciting for the player to bring a friend or two along not a perfect solution though
i dont mine so it makes no difference to me but i am sure miners wouldnt want to have to waste time and isk to scan things out or get a mission every time they wanted to mine scanning being hugely time isk and skill intensive and mining missions needing a an agent and b luck getting the right missionas for missions for groups they already exist they are called l5s it is just that risk vs reward for them is broken even before you factor in pirates l5s need a big increase in reward again
if you meant scanning as exploration when ever did it cost much to start out last time i check you barely need some isk to start but we mining mission suck in income you cant even really get much out of them to pay out your shiny hulk you would have to do about 50 mining mission average they take 45 min solo in a maxed out implantrig drone which is totally impractical to repay since they are 2 million isk each last i check to pay off a skiff mining mercoxit00 ore in your alliance would require minimum effort if you brought it at empire pricemission for group yes they do exist however no mining mission level 5 yet exist nor level 5 miningastrosurvey agentsjust fyi not interested in flaming or anything
i agree with most of the points made with the exception of moving level 4 missions to lowsecin particular i think the dynamic agent quality shows a lot of promise for spreading population out or even encouraging missions in lowsec in combination with the boost to lowsec mission rewards i could see for example making a change so that the server checked agent useage each downtime or perhaps once per week and lowered the quality of the 25 most used agents at each level by a point and increased the quality of the 25 least used agents by a point current hot spots would quickly become less profitable and outoftheway and lowsec agents would become more attractiveim not a fan of having agents move more than a minimal amount this would have a heavy secondary effect penalizing traders trying to sell to missionrunners
i agree that mining missions need a boost i was just trying to say that nerfing normal mining is not the right way to go about that
although i think fw missions were designed to be group missions everything else needs a look supporting on basis of this is important stuff
ankh i wanted to call your attention to a missionrelated topic i posted previously if i can find it againhere it is vision eve should encourage people to fly in gangs to make isk morethis post gives some missioningspecific detailalthough thats a really ambitious idea anything that would make missioning more groupcentric would be welcome
throws his support in the general direction
i have created and posted in so many please look at missions threads i think my fingers are bleeding however one more1 missions need to be made more dynamic and unpredictableyes and more logical to the agent type giving them and better variety of completion goals i have come up with some examples here2 mission payout in lowsec and 00 needs improvementyes wouldnt tempt me into low sec even if they paid 100x what they do now but im sure it would tempt others3 module loot has a negative impact on the economy by making t1 production obsolete and injecting too many minerals into the economynot bothered either way really  i reprocess the lower end mods but dont use the mins every now and then i just give them en masse to a friend in production but its nice seeing a nice meta item drop from time to time to add to my collection i tend to just give all my salvage items to this same player  every now and then she makes me something nice for free4 missions in factional warfare require improvementsi dont do fw so cant comment on this5 mining missions require improvementsyes  not entirely easy since mining is mostly about going to a rock blasting it with lasers and picking up the rubble see also a couple of the ideas i posted in the thread linked above6 agents are static resulting in overloaded mission hubs desire to have agent quality made dynamicor just remove agent quality have mission quality and reward based solely on skills and standings7 level 4 missions in their current form do not belong in highsecurity spaceno no no i am a casual player and i like running missions having discovered i can now do level 4s and live i hope to move up to doing them exclusively soon take em out of high sec and i would probably leave the game  been doing 3s for about 18 months now and they are getting dull 8 standing is being monopolized by missions no ways to get standing outside of mission running with the exception of fw standingi like standings its one of my weird things about mmos the more ways to improve them the better fw didnt do it for me though edit  supported although i do feel that ank might have better served this particular cause by jumping on the back of one or several of the other missioning threads which have been around for longer and generally have more support than this one tarminics thread is i think the one with the most thumbs so far
besides people i know and my self having done lvl 4 missions in less than 3 months of play i have no idea how it took you 18 months to get to level four missions but people also need to consider that by changing the rewards from missions in low sec and 00 the are also making mining and ratting an even less viable source of income also that if you keep the same level of income in high sec lvl 4 missions then it really didnt do anything most mining income is less than grinding lvl 4s and ratting is a whole lot less stable if you increase low sec rewards it just swings the balance even farther out to make an impact you would have to reduce the rewards so that the incentive is not that these are better than you are use to but what is are use to is now no longer in high sec and you have to move down to get itspelling i think not grammar not so much punctuation i never
edit how about no
yes
i have to agree
worth looking into this proposal

excellent suggestion imo ccp set it up on the test server for a week and at least give this some thought please
still going to hurt blaster boats and our tiny optimalalso we need our mwd during pvp blaster boats so turning our guns off while its running can nerf us still
i concur maybe missions should be looked at but dont adjust their payout or the loot dropped i for one salvage and loot the wrecks and refine said loot to build stuffthis will kill a legitimate playstyle that is highsec pve it will also ruin what little lowsec pvp remains ie pvp in lowsec and make money in empirethis idea is fail
unless youve read most descriptions of or issues on and with blasterboats the whole deal with them is that they are supposed to charge hard and deal with the threat through huge damage before they are worn down well if they are gallente that is and not rangebonused things UFFFD la caldari in which case you wont have too much of a problemit should work really

yeah we should do this
yes pleasea much better solution to the current problem
ya lets remove local and make life better for roaming gangs to take on ratters and moon miners lets do this sarcasmyou idiots who want local gone havent been in 00 long enough to realize how important it is to survive do this for me go run through 00 and dont look at local even once just minimize it and see how long you last

you are extremely dense as you limit it to your income leaving out the corporation income from moons but including the corporation level expenses for defense00 is not only personal income it is personalcorporation income while high sec is personal incomecorporation tax as corporations in high sec have very little isk making activity that a solo player cant do research pos rental onlyabout the edited post i edit only for grammar andor spelling errorssometime i edit to add a second part to the post instead of adding a second postyou can check the posts and see if someone has cited them differently try finding them you ad hominen attack fail miserably
agreed the idea of nerfing highsecurity missions is a bad idea i cannot support this
mainly a problem for people who live in pos you can not see when the insurance expires without traveling to a station with an insurance tab

ive proposed the first idea in another thread yeah its not a bad one as for a focusfire ddd i stole the idea off jade give it the choice of doing huge dps to enemy capital ships or doing the current ddd aoe effect personally i prefer the varieties of ddd mentioned in this thread to just a simple mod to make it xxxl artillery but its an option like i said it needs something to make it stay on grid and i dont care too much what
nooooowhy not drop loot like drones no t1 modules only mineralsi need the minerals for production of ammo and ships from lp store
i am a missioner and i agree with this at the moment everyone is a scrap dealer from the start and meta items can not be made but t2 can be inveted and made which is odd at the moment from refining t1 i make my own ammunition i would still be able to do some mining to support my ammo making but could probably only make the less effective ammo since i would be mining in hisechowever do not raise the lp reward or money from doing missions but rather change what drops and what you can do with it some ideas1 take out all t1 and replace with more metal scraps therefore players loot scrap metal make these only refinable by people with the scrap metal refine skill or very very very 10 max inefficiently refinable unless you have this skill have different types of metal scraps with the stuff that refines into the rarer ores being rarer and only on high level missions you now have a new type of industrialist the scrap metal merchant and refiner2 make meta item drops much much rarer after all the ships have been fried in combat we assume that t1 0 items are of such low quality that they destroyed in combat only meta items have a slim chance of surviving instead make meta bpcs inventable from t1 blueprints or researchable gives researchers and inventors another thing to do however their production inventing and researching requires items got from refining different types of scrap metal 3 keep salvaging as it isso missions runners make isk from selling scapmetal scrap metal merchants refine and sell products to industrialists who buy bpcs for meta items from inventors and researchers and then make meta items for the market producing all t1 items from 0 to meta becomes viable and missioners still get valuable items just items they can not use immediateleyminers especially those in low sec and 00 have a purpose once more
and where does that leave the miners
dont have to buy minerals now since i am refining my loot so you still can mine and build some nice t1 stuff wich will not be on the market from loot
in other words screw the miners
anyone can mine and get minerals to build thingsthose that are mining larger volumes to sell more skilled miners and make isk already mine and sell to make isk what is really being argued for here is loot dropped so that some players can make more isk this of course will be at the expense of the other players of eve and will impact the newer players greatlyloot drops provide starting players with modules to fit ships and experiment with it also gives them a small source of income which is tough when you first start outdropping loot will hurt the newer players which is why im against the ideaarithron
excellent idea
best way to nerf them tbqh dont nerf the modules nerf the ridiculous stacking of them
on the fence i think a hard cap would be an easy fix just limit everything to no faster than x with x being things like interceptors light missilesetcand no hacs wouldnt be up near x theyd be closer to bs max speeds than inties by a good bit
how aboutmarket purchases include a shipping and handling fee then items are delivered in a relatively timely manner from station of origin to your current stationdepending on the space between distance and sec the fee and the delay will varythis would solve the jita problem since no one would have to cram themselves into a hub to sell their waresand the fact that it only works for market purchases would still leave courier contracts viable for moving bulk cargo
1 practically destroys the trade business 2 theres no problem with jita or similarly rens i find it very convenient that the lowest prices are in one place market hubs are not an artificial occurrence they happen in real life 3 most players especially those who dont live in empire rely on these major hubs for a reliable place to get their hulls and modules every time4 i dont like giving more tasks to npcs it takes away from the playerdriven vision
i remember a dev blog about interbus delivering to your station only if its in the same constilation and high sec would solve jita lag dunno what they are doing with it though
1 i think it might actually help the market given that you could choose the perfect station for your production and vend your wares from that location instead of trucking them somewhere else for sale2 lowest prices are fine but the incredible lag that everyone complains about would instantly go away if 40000 people didnt have to cram themselves into a single system to buy and sell as for hubs today theyre called ebay and amazon and your orders are mailed to your front door3 again you rely on getting the best deals at those locations whereas this change would still mean you get the best deal but without the hassle of waiting for a lull in playerbase so you can manage the lag long enough to retrieve your merchandise4 player driven doesnt work anymore take a look at all the complaints for courier contracts 500bil collateral 50 jumps 350 isk reward when no one is taking the contracts anymore because people are r3tard3d in drafting them in the first place then we invent a new system and move onaccording to game info interbus is supposed to be a delivery service its already there were just giving them an actual job to do
that would be oh so nice
cap of 80 is not enough
if more than 500 people add a character to their ignore list the character should not be able to make any more contracts
sounds good to me
noob griefing is too easy to do i started a corp when i first started playing and got squashed by a pirate corp and i started a second corp which i kept going for 4 months but getting war decd week after week makes it impossible to get anywherecorp of noobs vs corp of 3 year old pirates the noobs have not got a chance it costs way too little to go to war with noobs its too easy to grief themi propose the cost for going to war should be raised not sure to what amount but it needs looking at
when approaching a change in 00 mechanics in the jita park forum there are certain fundamental principles that need to be adhered to throughout a discussion in jita park titled what determines sovereignty an examination of the concept our group of posters was able to agree on a few concepts that should be true anywhere called playerowned spacelinkageedit also a consolidated version by nande yanen that sums up a bunch of our goals read this insteadlinkage ii1 sovereignty logistics and security are three distinct concepts2 sovereignty should be based on permanent military presence3 holding sovereignty should benefit your logistics4 logistics inherently benefits your sovereignty truth no mechanics needed5 security should benefit both sovereignty and logistics6 sovereignty and logistics should be fairly static in comparison to security7 security should be more dynamic based on friendly presencethe total mechanics of player owned space should fulfill all of these goals the mechanic i propose implements a different system for each of the three concepts of system ownershipsovereignty  claimed by the control of planets through a layered system of destructible orbital structureslogistics  the current pos system anchored at moonssecurity  the presence of sentry guns on stargatesthe following 3 posts will hopefully dispel fears of the new systemthe stargates arent ctf trust me and read through
holding sovereignty through planet controlfulfills 1 2 3 6sovereignty must be determined by the amount of military presence of a system by first breaking this down into planets a limit is placed on sovereignty strength number of planets and an easy way of determining sovereignty is created whoever controls the most planets system sovereignty can be neutralized simply by gaining control of more planets than the enemyplanetary control is broken down into further layers the main structure is the orbital defense platform located at either the physics l1 or l2 lagrangian point of the planet a maximum of two can be deployed per planet but a lone odp can claim planetary control planetary control can be neutralized by deploying your own odp or by destroying enemy odps they have the comparable strength of debatable a smallmedium pos orbital defense platforms rely on fuel from the planet to recharge their shields odp are refueled by lowaltitude refueling satellites much closer to the planet because of the location of these structures only medium hulls cruisers and below can maintain stability and as such are the only ships able to lock on to their warp signature they can be located by use of a new astrometrics probe destroying the satellites can potentially cut off fuel to the odps as each odp requires 3 active refueling satellites to maintain a maximum level of fuel each day as a safeguard an odp carries enough fuel to maintain shield recharge for 24 hours giving the defending alliance a chance to deploy more into orbit to balance this refueling satellites are not owned and if planetary control switches the new owner gains these satellitesoutcomessovereignty is determined by planetcontrol countmaintaining orbital defense platforms determines planet controlorbital defense platforms rely on refueling satellitesattacking refueling satellites weakens the odp but requires you replace themafter this sovereignty remains the same progressing from 14 with time the benefits are the same except for the invulnerability of pos and outposts moon based pos are now solely for cynojammers jumpbridges and moon mining
security based on gate sentry gunsfulfills 5 6 7i for one have always wanted a way to defend your space from anyone who passes through if large factions can put guns on their gates why cant we the following is from our jita park discussionafter this the security of a system can be determined this isnt such a huge mechanic as stargates capture which may have led to system ctf but rather a way for owneralliance presence or lack of to have some effect on system security the proposition here is that if every stargate in a system has active guns the system is secure and pos outposts and orbital defense platforms of the holding alliance are invulnerable thus if a system has a cynojammer the alliance should pay attention and keep its sentry guns up and running other less tactical systems dont need such babysitting there of course would be a notification system if your system security went into the contested stagethus security has nothing to do with sovereignty it simply makes holding sovereignty easier by 1 giving you guns on gates and 2 protecting your tactical and logistical structures
i think many of the emergent mechanics will be clear from here so ill give my support and open the floorfahtim meidires
although im not sold on the orbital structures around planets this is a great summary of the issue and the general direction of dividing the concept of territory into sovereignty logistics and security is excellentid see two things that probably need to be debated1 what is the ai of the anchorable gate guns i think youd see a lot of resistance to the idea of the guns autofiring on 10s perhaps autofiring on wartargets would work but more likely the only fair way to do it is to have them defend alliance members  so if you have aggression on a member of the alliance that owns the gun they will fire on you2 where are cynojammers located in this scenario do you have to contend with pos guns to attack them once security is lost id advocate for tactical structures like the cynojammer being moved to a nonpos arraystyle setup under this system
the ai should be customizable by the holding alliance some may want to keep it free of 10s some may want it to shoot just enemies some may want it to shoot neutrals tooyeah theyre still on normal pos i see the reasons against it but the way i see it there should be a way to prevent capitals namely titans from being on the same grid as the jammer while leaving the jammer at a pos personally i think warp drives should be removed from capitals but because thats such a different issue ill leave that to another thread for another day
why would the ai be any different then that of pos guns where you setup them up to follow standingsi dont know why your making more work for people and not giving anything in return what kind of resources will planets give for holding them etc
just cause thatd be way overpowered it would never get passed or implemented
thats exactly how they would work like pos gunsholding planets is a layer under system sovereignty which eventually grants fuel use bonuses to logistics structures pos however im sure your question lies deeper than that so ill continueunder the current system many pos are set up for the sole purpose of claiming sovereignty essentially were moving that particular system to planets that way pos are strictly logistics and planets are strictly for system controlnow that pos are strictly for moon mining jump bridges and cyno jammers theres no reason to load up a system with 30 of them takes away the pos shot grind and makes the transfer of power quicker  but still requires that you build an infrastructure of tactical structures
i actually would like stargate sentries to work exactly like pos guns it should take 23 bs to punch through a gate and a drake shouldnt be able to tank them of course frigs and other quick aligners should be able to slip throughedit but yeah the idea is just that there are guns specifics can be worked out by ccp
it sure would be nice if one of the csms could actually take on the mantle of lord of the drones and look at all the issues concerning drones and amalgate them in one postdocument there are a myriad of things wrong with dronesdroneui that should all be looked at in relation to each other
greetingstoday a corp member asked me if we were buying various minerals after checking our stock and also trying to set up a contract to this end i found that i cantwhat i would like to see is some way to do an item exchange contract that allows us to select an item from a list a list comprised of the same things you see on the market rather then things you have in your hangar or corp hangar that way we could set up corp contracts for basically anything or in this case for mineralsfor example lets say we set up a corp contract that we want 20 mil trit this contract can then be filled by any corp member and as soon as they complete it they get their isk for it
already exists go to contracts click on the big yellow you can create n more contracts set up an item exchange my corporation jump to page 3 add items in the box at the bottom
thats just it i dont want to add items i want the one accepting the contract to add the ore or mineral the corp wants and once they do they get the cash rewards from the contracti want to be able to set up a contract that states tss is purchasing 10000000 tritanium  25 isk this contract will expire in 10 daysso the members look over the corp contracts see this one and head out to a belt and mine some veldspar once they have 10000000 tritanium they accept the contract and their tritanium is removed from their hangar and placed in the corp hangar and the cash is given to the player from the corp wallet
the box im referring to is a list of things the person accepting the contract must provide if you want a contract to buy 20 million trit in corp go to that box type tritanium quantity 20 000 000 add item set the i will pay to the desired amount and click through
im all for its own thread it cant hurt and it definitely needed its not just a roleplaying part of the game thats a hypocritical statement to make there fw players are made up of everyone not just roleplayers in fact there are probably more nonroleplayers in fwit deserves its own channel perhaps even a recruitment channel for militiasill never play jade online

the biggest challenge we have here is thispeople play this game simultaneously all over the world 237 however they all dont wake up do their thing and then play all at the same time because its not the same time all over the world this in and of itself creates an awesome dynamic there are whole regions of space that are owned by someone that if you entered at the right time would be like a tour of a ghost system go into delve some time after 0200 et and be surprised by empty system after systemthe core problem we have with this mechanic is that there isnt a euro east us central us west us anzac ap india server where people log on stay on and log off close to the same time there are entire swaths of time where short of doing something ridiculous to play internet space ships like stay up 24 hours or alarm clock an operation at 3am or something else crazy outside your normal lifes schedule that you cant doso the pos mechanic of reinforced and reinforcing timers and the strategy that has evolved around those needs to be kept in any sovereignty system that comes out of this discussion a capture the flag mechanic can not solve the 237 problem this is more like a play by mail chess game moves made pieces put into place and the execution of that strategy over time is what wins or looses the systemthe main problem in the mechanic is this to reinforce a pos and to defend a pos from being reinforced are extremely imbalancedattacker of pos that is onlinejump in an overwhelming number of capitals or if a cyno jammer is in place an even larger number of battleships and you blow up guns then shoot pos until its reinforcedoption 1come back in x time and do it againoption 2camp said thing until the timer runs out blowing away anything that tries to repair any defensesships in order to keep said systemgf experiences both of those with option number 2 being the much maligned delve campaign having participated in the taking of and then loss of qy6 i can say that id be amazed if people werent physically ill afterwords due to the number of people that did the 24  30  36  48 hours of no sleep in an effort to out camp the next guythats todays pos warefare in a nutshellhow do you fix iteasy nerf stuff make dreads worthless make carrier repair blobs worthless overpower the guns so they can 5shot someone there are lots of ways to make this so ugly that you effectively destroy fleet lag festsi mean the united states of america didnt hot drop 75 dreadnoughts with 50 carriers that spider repped them on japan logistically impossible due to the manpower needed for thiscapital ships are controlled by one person and one person only they mash buttons just like the frigate pilot does the mechanic is identical the buttons they mash just happen to do a crap ton more damage or they happen to repair a lot better than the other guy or whatever but at the core its one person doing it instead of a concert of people with functions to do just like you have on a real world capital class ship this person just happened to either been round long enough figured out how to make a ton of money in the game or has nothing better to do with their money than throw it at time card buyingselling so they could get said shipwhy not revisit the capital class as a true multiplayer ship you have a pilot that makes it go you have individual gunners you have engineeringpower management you have defense systems and you have pilots of smaller ships that the larger ship deploys these are corporate owned assets instead of individual assetswill this  people off yes undoubtedly will people leave yes most likely thats not fair whatever i mean look at the screaming you have around the speed changes that are coming
first let me say this its hilarious to have someone call me out on alliance tags when lookin at mine second you take a goon concept capture the flag you imbed it into the brains of 5000 people and now everytime revamping 00 comes up you get  it cant be like capture the flag 237 no way 00 should be capture the flag  people shouldnt get to play out in 00 just cause they subscribe and certainly not capture the flag in spacenow back to the mindless dribble your suggesting a total reworking of the game which is about as far from productive as just randomly disconnecting 70 of people in a lag system to help the cluster recoup and you havent even identified the biggest challenge properly the biggest challenge is the technology if people could actually fight on grid and lag wasnt an issue then the best people would win and the garbage playeralliances would fold but you add lag to the side of the defender and then tedium and boredem to the side of the aggressor and you get the status quo alliances with lots of people doing lots of boring stuff and thats why you have people up all hours of the day and night just to make up the difference i want to see slight changes to give the aggressors better options defenders more options at the pos with additional gunners less logistic runs to towers but for pete sake bring the hp down so you dont need mega fleets to do attacks within reasonable times small changes to the current system are all that are needed not wide sweeping revisions of the sov concept no new modules no special useless sov mechanics added fix it a bit for simplicity and testing
if anything they need to make jumpclones harder to achieve rather than easier20 million at your 100 standing example is absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of eve
im not a macro farmer and i dont plan on ever selling isk online i just think it would be nice if you could select 4 or 5 asteroids and have the option to automine them my ship has 4k space and 1 mining 1 laser so it gets kinda boring mining one asteroid at a time with an automine option you could select the 45 asteroids and your ship will automatically mine the nearest asteroid till its gone then move to the second and so forth until all five are gone or your hold is full at that point the ship will just come to a standstill and play the your hold is full wav either way you would have to manually chose what to do nextit gets a little tedious when you have to sit there and watch yourself mine for 1020 minutes then move to the next asteroid and since you have to manually set the asteroids you want and manually fly back to the station or create a container it wouldnt be anything like a bot just a slight time saver for dedicated miners i use a pve ship to earn money for skills and lp items but its way cheaper to farm your own mats for building blue printsi guess technically i could equip a cruiser with mining lasers and drones then just jettison to a locked cargo bin each time its full then bring in the frieghter to pick up the bin contents however i still think a way to waypoint mine would be pretty cool just in terms of saving time and brain cellsedit let the flamming begin
mining in an industrial ship the worst ship for mining except for a freighterread haladas mining guidealso there are plenty of useful posts in resource thread in each subforum
ore in lowsec too valuable  you read something wrong i believe
the op has a point with the way eve works the lack of flexibility in the supply of some raw materials is causing imbalances personally i like the suggestion best to make it possible to refine common moonmaterials into smaller amounts of more rare materials
nosome people dont want to be in player corps more power to them you dont need to smash up a legitmate playstyle in order for you to get your cheap ganks on your alleged farmers or newer andor solo playersyou may not believe it but they do react to petitions and they do investigate these matters however its not as black and white as you think it is if you have absolutely no way to escape being war decced as you want corp hopping to be an exploit and shot openly you would hurt the entire game as a whole
these were just idea to bring to the tableim trying not to think selfishlypersonally when it comes to war decing most dont seem to say a reason just declarei think it is cruel of us to basically force people to stay in npc corps til then hit the mid ships range and able to defend themselfas to finding a corp that cant be war decdi havent met one personally yet

i would like you to learn about resource creation and allocation so that you then know why this is a horrible ideanow being able to reskin your ship from a list of the existing color schemes sure id like to give drake a mordu legion paintjob or fly around in a myrmidon with the eomstyle skin or a nighthawkstyle redblack skinned myrm for true awesome
pity support
this place is the pits seriously i thought the idea lab was bad yes i liked the old name better but this place issueissueissue1ive still not seen a single good argument for why there are now two different forums for improvements to the game
i would think the most obvious solution would be to give everyone the equivalent of having rank 5 in all the learning skills remove the learning skills themselves and refund any skill points anyone has spent in the learning skills personally id think it would probably be better to give everyone a bit less than the equivalent of rank 5 but that would be unfair to the people who trained them to rank 5 ive already trained my learning skills to 54 and it was completely pointless that i would have to do that just to keep from being penalized even if i hadnt its not like my idea could be implemented soon enough that i wouldnt still have to train themthe game is making you train them if you dont you get penalized with fewer sp

all of the skills are boring its a timer see my above post on how any player with half a brain in planning can make it less of a grind new players who are capable of this simple task should be rewarded
nice example tho it depends on how your atributes are or every 1 thats diffrent there are some topics how to create the best balanced char for those who are already for a long time running know for themself if it was worth it or nottho evenmon give you the option like showed above so it free you dont have to train them like said manny times in hereif ccp removes them ok but doubt it coz 99 of the ppl who trained them want compensation than incl me
1 the majority of ccp employees play eve and from all the stats ive heard they lean far more heavily towards 00 and pvp careers than the player base as a whole remember the scandal wasnt about t2 bpos being given to caldari provisions 2 the devs read the forums and since any new thread on eve general has a 127 chance of being about lag of one sort or another i think theyd have clued in by now 3 theyve been at work building a new server for months now yeah i think they know
ok i dont care about any of the above issues but fair enough lets look at them but could just one of the csms look at drones please no damage notifications no t2 mods ui etcetcetc
csm and the players csm and the players csm and the players you forgot something when you made the highlighted posteveryone else 
the majority of the idea were originally proposed by everyone else and the csm gave their support or didnt its not jades fault that hes sponsoring all of them
heres the basic formula that i think would workpos and outposts can be attacked by sieges  capships and big fleetsbut they are protected by cynojammers positioned away from the pos jump bridges and the like fall under the same categorybut  and this is what id add to the above  the cynojammer and other arrays cant be attacked unless they are made vulnerable through a third system governed by small gangs the small gangs dont necessarily do damage themselves but they sow vulnerability when they arent opposed opening the door for larger attacksits the ability of small gangs to sow that vulnerability is missing i think a very fair tactic to open up because it allows for the claimed but unsecure type of space
this is why the planetbased sovereignty works you have two options to destroy cyno jammers either destroy them directly at a moon pos using brute force or disable them indirectly by disrupting sovereignty at planets
sorry kelsin but im continually falling against stargates playing a role in anything although even if only in name tfunk wuz here i still believe you would see bitter contesting going on which would actually be pretty hilarious alliances would definitely try to one up each other on stargate contests dont lie you would be ed if i put my name on one of your gates you would come back to shoot at ithowever i think theyre bad because theyre too volatile and seriously its like turning the game into ctf i wouldnt care if there were player destroyed structures that served the exact same function and were deployed in some random location in the system but stargates are starates turning them into anything else isU6C17U60AAinstead i propose that whatever goals for increasing system volatility even with very very minor impact to the holding power are integrated into some other structure that is not a stargatei kinda want to start work on a compramise of sorts preliminary goals no order of importance1 create infrastructure for breaking large fights into smaller bites2 make poss economic tools give us other tools for sov give us still yet more tools for the serfs3 make sure that all of them kind of tie together such that a small gang can do small things a large gang can do large things and a siege gang can smash down the whole package after the stront timers are upim really really really in favor of some way to break up conflicts into smaller bites its not so much the lag thing but how they would complicate larger fights and make the act of engaging not so straightforward something where you have to acknowledge a gang 50 your strength as a very serious threat and make sure they dont get the upper hand on you in a situation where they can keep you divided much more emphasis on good commanders and keeping the enemy pinned support
post 11  the orbital structure plan  i think does just that leaves pos alone for infrastructure while creating a sovereignty system based on small objectives does it fulfill your goals if so id like to tidy it up and present it in assembly hall maybe even cosponsor it with you if we make a few adjustments on it
i came up with some ground rules for an ideal solution let me know what you think1 we want some volatile goals to recognize that skizzlefist is leading raids into territory nightly and the defenders are doing nothing about it however any volatile goals must not destroy property that is victory or defeat at the minor goal level is more about average time spent in the victory or defeat condition if you can consistently win small gang skirmishes at these objectives i believe those victories should weigh upon or provide advantages to the defenderthis should defeat stayathome tactics nothing more boring than a group that knows you cant disrupt anything with the puny twenty man gang you have they sit inside and wait for you to go awayi think a fueling system is a decent solution fuel is expensive and burning lots of gas all the time because youre lazy is a decent way to harass a stayathome alliancei would enjoy getting attacked via this method simply for the you want to form up a five man gang and go reorient our planetary array that got hit would vastly increase number of smallgang skirmishes2 orbital defense platforms are the heart of sov they are the fight brokers stront timers that tell us when the showdown will happen they give the defenders advantages and function to create the battlefield they are timezone equalizers these behaviors exist for reasons and poss are to an extent serving their purpose in these rolesthe reason why real military strat is so often fascinating to those who study it is that there is essentially limitless ways to approach and maneuver forces there are terrain limitations etc to every location only in eve does it all get focused on gates and poss which is really a shame considering that we have an entire solar systemthe major military goals need to in some way require simultaneous interaction at several locations such that its possible through good feinting and winning the support skirmishes to cut a disorganized fleet within reason20 guys harassing 100 guys is entirely fair in my view this will eliminate the all too frequent sov battles where the defender knows theyre severely outnumbered and thus never show up it also will provide opportunities for an attacker to whittle down a large defenderthe system should scale well with fleet size a large tower might be influential in a small fight but in a large fight its basically a fixture the new system should allow for direct influence on the outcome for defenders and attackers of all sizes osprey fleets doing bad things at satellites i think is entirely a healthy thing id at least rather be hunting down osprey fleets than waiting on a gate for an outnumbered enemy who never shows upsomething likehow about an orbital defense platform tied to several satellites disabling satellites reduces orbital platform firepower and defenses sayeach platform contributes constant shield recharge and extra power griddisabling a satellite means youve disrupted its orbit and it enters an emergency status where it no longer provides power to the platform thus guns go offline the shield recharge rate goes flat the tower goes down fairly quicklyif you think of a large planet like jupiter the gravitational tides are what heat the moons which are pretty hot in some cases so theres a lot of energy happening in just simple planetary rhythmssay the satellite needs a particular alignment and will get overwhelmed by attack but can be realigned by repairing the overloaded systems restoring full functionality to the odp and demanding attention
im not sure why anything involving stargates would have to have the drawbacks youre talking about shooting naming  didnt have any of that stuff in my proposal but for now thats beside the pointplanets can work really anything can work as long as small gang harassment can open the door for fleet attacks on utility structures which can in turn open the door for capship sieges of pos thats your formula for a comprehensive territory control system
3 very prelim idea but its kind of ridiculous that the sov tools and alliance power holding tools also deny the capability to sublet a system to someone else thus theres no real infrastructure for separating the citizens of your empire from the people who owndefendexpand the empirefinally some good solid separation of carebears and pvpersjust like the system of now being able to disrupt these peoples livelyhoods is a direct assault on the economic presence of the sovereign powerswhat you thinkand yes i say we clean up a proposal here let mine fall by the wayside and you can start up a new one that i will sponsorthe only thing im truly insistent upon is some system that attracts attention at multiple locations so that small the tackling pinning and support skirmishing will have real impact on the attackers and defenders like they need that mobility to operate effectively at current since everything is on one grid its blob vs blob and nobody needs to go anywhere until one side decides to retreat during that time support doesnt play all that valuable of a role id like to see mobility and efficient movements accomplishing more from a tactical standpoint
im going to call it a night after this but i had a thoughtthere was a proposal on how small ships might be able to fight caps by disabling subsystems in the futurewhat if the support structures had subsystems that are hard to target for large guns but easily tagged by small guns thus small ships will have a method of impact as much as large ships when it comes to force multipliers at the satellites it sounds bad to have small ships playing pivotal roles but i believe it would be very healthy to trigger lots of small skirmishes its not like you cant take out two hundred velators anyway so its not like it can become too overbiased towards supportthese subsystems could be at the satellites or at the main platform why not both itd be incredibly fun to be ninjaing around a fivehundred man gang and causing them headaches while trying to deplete their support wings as an attacker it would be much more fun to have to deal with these things than to wait for a defender who never shows up
awesome  and i think i have a solution to your last part you need to have surveillance satellites to coordinate fueling but only frigs can lock on to their signature and warp to them as they are moving in a fast orbit around the planet you need refueling satellites to keep the odps up and running but only cruisers and smaller can lock their signature and warp then orbital defense platforms can be hit by bs and caps but without the smaller subsystems they cannot defend themselves properly and can quickly go into reinforced  giving the defending alliance 24 hours to restore the smaller satellites or letting the opds become vulnerable to attack the planetary defense headquarters can be removed no problem cool im gonna rewrite it tomorrow need sleep but ill check this tomorrow feel free to pm me in game as well
only frigs can lock onto the micro satellites warp signature only cruisers and below can lock onto the fuel satellites warp signature rp reason  theyre moving in fast orbit around the planet at altitude too low for a larger hull to sustain stability
clients do not send data to each other and as such theres no handshaking to worry about each client sends data to the server the server accumulates it and sends it all to each client its not nn12 its 2n
for each ship s1 on gridfor each ship s2 on gridsend position of s1 to s2
quick thought to use or not at your discretionthe mechanic id like to see is system security in 00 territory a secure solar system grants invulnerability to the pos and nonpos tactical structures cynojammer jump bridge etc in order to attack those structures you must disrupt the secure status of the system once a solar system drops into unsecure status those structures become vulnerable to attack by fleets and capship siegessecure vs unsecure is based on the small gang activity in the system or constellation perhaps and all that is left is to determine the exact mechanic essentially the deal is  if you keep law and order in your systems through good policing and suppression of insurgent activity your infrastructure is protected but if a solar system falls into civil unrest and lacks law and order it can transition into a war zone further tangible benefits could be assigned to secure status systems  like the ability to anchor sentry guns at stargates etc it just remains to find a good mechanc for how players make a solar system secure or unsecure
nande is correct youre looking at the wrong thing true data goes one way and goes back the other way thats 2n but this issue was the total number of ship locations that have to be sent there are n pilots each pilot needs to know the location of the other n1 pilots on grid the server has to send nn1 total ship locations it doesnt get divided by two because in this case ab is different from ba
so maybe thissovereignty is determined by tactical structures at planets having sovereignty grants logistics bonuses like less fuel at pos and the ability to anchor cynos jump bridgeslogistics are based around pos having logistics reaps the obvious economic advantages of moon mining jump bridges cynocyno jammers hangars etc outposts must also be put in this categorysecurity is determined by having active sentry guns on gates total system security grants invulnerability to logistics and tactical structuresthis makes it much less back and forth
yeah i could see simple gate guns as a good indicator  insurgents would go around blowing them up to sow chaos and taking down these token defenses would be a preamble to large scale invasions of a systemedit i also like that you distinguish between methods for establishing sovereignty logistics and security instead of one thing doing all three
some fleshing out of ideas for security via gate gunsgate gun is an anchorable module powered by the stargate  some maximum number of guns can be anchored on a gate so as not to be ridiculous deathstarsonline gate guns can be shot up and disabled  disabled is like a reinforcement period  and after some amount of time if nobody has come along and repaired the gun it goes offline at this point it can be stolen blown up etcso a secure system is one in which the guns are tended to and remain online an unsecure system is one in which the guns are offline or disabledsomething like that
i do like it the benefits from disrupting stargates are more appropriate now and the separation of sovlogisticssecurity will be a main focus in my proposal hoping to get it up by tonight
how long have you been involved with the game  have you been here through most of the major changes on tranquility since 2003 05 19 first or second week of eve i have been participating in the open beta before it startedwhat race of ships can you pilot minmatar gallente caldariwhat have you installed in place to make sure all proposals put forward are looked at in an unbiased manner i am born with the skill of unbiased perception level 5 besides this i have a set of experts of different playstyles i used to consult in matters i am not completely familiar with what guarantees do we have that any changes are not purely beneficial to only yourselves or your current corp  alliance my wordwhat is your main bulk of eve time spent doing  ie pvp pve manufacturing invention etcdiplomacy pvp
how long have you been involved with the game  have you been here through most of the major changes the first traces of me dates back to late 04what race of ships can you pilot all races of just about everything but commandships and battleshipswhat have you installed in place to make sure all proposals put forward are looked at in an unbiased manner everything is going to be biased based on our constituencies views so you might want to expand on that questionwhat guarantees do we have that any changes are not purely beneficial to only yourselves or your current corp  alliance cant things are always going to benefit somebody but some things also hurt me despite the fact i vote for them due to it being better for game balancewhat is your main bulk of eve time spent doing  ie pvp pve manufacturing invention etcpiracypvp production and trading
well look up my character date i was here the moment the game hit my shopgallente and some amarrid say my history so far proves im quite unbiased and i have relatively public channels in game and do my best to respond to all the mail i getsee history and im not even in a corp or alliance sofactional warfare and missions because this has been done to death in the election process hehe

please explain how black ops battleships can compete with capital ships in anything for those of you dont have any experience with pos warfare it is impossible for black ops battleships to do anything at all to hostile poses the guns would literally rip you apart as soon as they locked you none of the ships you can jump bridge in can affect poses at all either they are just simply too expensive when the t1 varient can do the same job at 10 of the cost and with the numbers of ships you need to attack poses the idea that black ops battleships can affect them at all is simply laughablealso for those of you with no pvp experience i would like to point out another thing no one wants a 500m isk tackler unless it can disengage at will aka factioned out vagabonds and rapiers otherwise the first time you tackle something and their buddies get their before yours you lose your ship the risk v reward ratio is just way too low the only way to justify using a ship that guarantees a 500m isk loss is if there is a very low chance of losing it per engagement and that means you have to be able to engage at range remember losing a black ops is equivalent to losing a carrier in isk value but it has 11000 of the hpi hope you guys get around to buffing them with the sept patch as they have been broken for 8 months already
a battleship using a pos portal is no more overpowered than a black ops black ops plain suck
re dsts using covert jump portals
 jumping into cynojammed systems  make the cov cyno visible when lighted in cyno jammed system bridging deep space transports sounds goodas far as their intended role goes in my eyes its logistical mostly meaning rapid pilot redeployment bridging around nano covops and grabbing combat ships from end destination and moving smaller amounts of high value cargo around in safe way ability to bridge deep space transports would count as serious boost in that section for some bizarre reason most of them seem to have some combat oriented bonuses also but those are more like aftertought than their intended role as they are in most areas they can do far outclassed by better and cheaper alternatives
no not another logistic class black ops should have good combat possibilities they should be able to solo into a hostile system to cause trouble there
fitting out a ship can be a timeconsuming activity the idea i will proposal in this thread aims to reduce this wasted timepreambleweve all been there  fitting out a ship some of us fit out dozens of ships in advance for our own stockpiles for our corporate stockpiles for our allianceetcmany a time you may have a standard setup which you will use again and again why not be able to save this fitting as an instruction sheetnow imagine this you have an unfitted ship with all the modules you need to attach to it  simply activate your prepared instruction sheet on it and it puts itself together youre now ready to go at present fitting out a ship sometimes trawling for the right modules in your hangar can take 15 minutes or longer now the time saved is much higher if you are fitting out standard issue ships en masse im sure many organisations do thisi would imagine that to do this would have a drawback  a small fee to the station crew whore fitting your mods for you this may also be a source of income for station owners while also functioning as a mild isk sink of the lazy
naturally i support my idea
ccp will probably scream at the number of database operations youre proposing but its a good idea even a fit as copy of current ship option would be very nice i wouldnt use it much on tq but on sisi where i burn ships like its going out of style itd be a lifesaver even for a fairly lowenergy player like me for corps photocopying huge numbers of ships this would be a big time saver
itd be nice but i have a suspicion it would  the database supported but i dont think its realistic
whyd this be stressful on the database its simply automating what players already do only extra is that you store a list of setups somewhere i for one would love this idea as some ships i fly have two module setups for different purposes solosupport for example
support fit templates are an obvious way to manage modules and batching db updates instead of lots of small changes should be a good thing
would be really handy as well when moving base of operations having to strip ships down to package for the freighter and then having to spend half an hour at the other end sorting out all the mods  a pain
yeah saved ship preset fits maybe would work

edit i misunderstood the op though im still not sure i support itedit 2 ok reread it i support
there was a while there where i was going through vagabonds and hurricanes like running waternaturally i support thisedit i played planetside for a couple of years and you could have several different layouts for your gear you just walked up to a terminal and picked out whatever layout you wanted it was quite convenient
the proposed changes are entirely too all encompassing in completely flipping current combat mechanics this will cause a lot of changes within the combat system at once ending in utter turmoil for the players nerfing snakes and polys is enoughthese other changes are going to kill current mechanics and strategytactics if ccp want to introduce these changes they need to do them over a longer timeframe instead of all at once many new pilots are just getting a grasp on combat mechanics this is going to flip their world upside down
strongly against the nerf
this is no nano nerf this is lets make all ships move like bricks
ccp will loose my 4 accounts not because of the nerf but because i dont support any service that doesnt listen to their customers as much as ccp does its insulting bunch of whiners oh no nos is bad oh no speed is bad y not nerf everything so we can all fly round in pwn mobiles

afk  cloaks
cant support this cloaks are weak enough read limited enough in useful application as is leave them bethe real solution to this would be for ccp to actually start enforcing their own rules and get rid of a lot of these isk selling farmersno support
i read through this thread got a different suggestionbigger ship  longer time for cloak to take effect on ship eg for a raven it would take what 20 seconds to full cloak thats enough time to find them if they havent ssdfurthermore i should point out that using a cloak to save your behind from a roaming gang is a perfectly legitimate way to do so otherwise it would just be a matter of time till the probes got to you p
i dont mind covert ops cloaking devices they are just fine how they are recons cov ops blackops maybe stealth bombers if someone trained up for cov ops he can sit on a safe spot afk as long has he wantsbut t1 cloaking ratters afk cloakers and similar folks are just lame 100 security for nearly no penalty locktime who caresmaking them scannable with ship probes 30 seconds is a bit to much imho what about giving them simililar signatur radiuses like plexes so you would have to get your quest probe launcher and several different probes to pin them down
theirs nothing wrong with cloaks leave them the hell alone to many things are going to  anyway because of whiners like u u dont like it adapt or quit
the limit could just be the maximum bounty amount set in the contract once the bounty hunter kills the target enough times to claim the whole bounty the contract is fulfilled and they lose their derived kill rights
that is the current idea 
agreed if the bounty hunter is flashy red to the person with the bounty on his head
thats the point of bounty hunters you dont know who they are till they try and collect the bounty once they start to try and collect theyll start flashing redarithron
yay nano nerf
definitely support the nerf
support damnit
aye

i like it you have my support
i like how they are just figuring this out as if they didnt intend this with their original design even though its been going on for nearly the entire history of eve and they are just now noticing this could the gmdevs really be this ignorant smells like brown thumbs to me
some of these ideas are a bit wacky but 00 space needs to be more valuable and less tedious not only to the alliance but the individual pilot the only way to make isk in 00 now is ratting and mining adding agents is a good stepregarding the mission types i dont see any need for 00 agents to be different than high sec just more profitable and risky members shouldnt be paid for accomplishing strategic objectives
currently there is much more content available in empire via the missions there that those in 00 cannot enjoy adding missions to conquerable 00 space outside of just the npc regions would add a lot more variety to 00 and hopefully entice more people out there from empire
why shouldnt 00 npc space be better than regular 0000 npc space  no alliance protection the true allornothing lands these are the badlands of new eden00 allianceheld space  a load usually hopefully of backup  lotsnlots of gunsand i am sorry my level4 18 effective 56 agent is not better than true 10that is a myth00 npc space should be the only truly 10 space in this game
because nonnpc 00 is taken and maintained by playerestablished infrastructure which must in turn be fought for and defended or attacked in npc 00 if ah excrement hits the cooling device you can just run for the station and hide until they go away you have nothing to defend in the space why bother fighting for itback to the topic step in the right direction terrible implementation theres little reason most of them would be filled by ops and theyd be pretty abusable lol watch me escort my altfurthermore a big problem as i see it is how moneymaking in 00 compares to that in empire moonmining is obviously tremendously profitable but on the other hand most of it is done at an alliance level and that which isnt only benefits the tiny minority most people mine or rat and to be honest you can make just as much money in complete safety doing l4 missions in highsec somethings wrong with thatobviously there are two solutions to this the first is to buff the 00 moneymaking methods somehow highend ores for example could yield more lowend minerals in addition to their current highend content an idea for ratting would be every rat kill yield a small amount of lp with an opposing pirate faction again in addition to their normal bounties im sure people more creative than i could provide better ideasthe other side of the coin is nerf the l4 missions except rather than nerf them move them send them off to lowsec id love to really suggest that they be moved to 00 but there are a lack of stations for the appropriate factions to accommodate themim not going to thumbsup this but i am hoping to see better ideas come out of itsuperlow truesec 00 isnt some magical ratting land that truesec only affects what the highest possible spawn there is and it has nothing to do with the lowestend in other words when i first enter a system its not uncommon to get one maybe two chainable battleship spawns the rest will be lowvalue battleship spawns cruiserfrigate spawns or nothing the lowvalue spawns have to be wiped out with the hope that they are replaced by something good wash rinse hope your good spawns dont despawn repeat while the end result if youre lucky is several highend spawns that you can chain to your hearts delight getting there can take hours during which you tend to make considerably less isk then youve also got to contend with other people ratting in said system which means youre splitting the spawns lowering the value still on top of that youre watching out for gankersyour 56 effective quality l4 in highsec on the other hand is 100 safe does not have its value lowered by having more players using it and is a steady consistent lpbountymission reward payoutif anything a big buff to 00 ratting would be to adjust it so that the truesec of the system does determine both the high and low ends of the rats that spawn there get past a certain point and you have no spawns of pure frigscruisers pass another point and spawns come in no less than two battleships and so onand as for your contention that npc 00 should be the best 00how are you qualified to judge that as a resident of empireby the way i have news for you npc pirate sovereignty systems automatically count as 10 truesec no matter what their actual truesec is this is part of why some regions such as delve are so good
kira novia your arguments are flawed and quite frankly dumbnot true there alliances in npc 00 and they do protect players to claim otherwise would be patently false npc 00 resembles empire high sec space more than player controlled 00 space because of the ability for anyone to dock at the stations present in npc 00 space the all or nothing line of thought is correct if you apply it to docking and undocking 00 space held by alliances does not equate guaranteed backup of any kindthe amount of backup is not determined by whether or not you are in player controlled or npc 00 space but by your alliance or corporation
it also depends on how far you have to go if you want a system to yourself so as to get the full potential out of it youre often going to wind up several jumps away from your alliances hubs this need to spread out to get the most out of ratting is part of why large alliances hold so much space
this idea makes it more profitable to live in 00 missions in conquerable space is something that people have been requesting consistently playercreated missions is a cool vision this gets the thumbs uplooking deeper it appears that part of your idea is that assorted mission runners will come to the space of an alliance and run missions there on behalf of the alliance this is like a way for people to contribute to a 00 alliance without being members of it or having any standings with it thats a neat idea although some of the details you mention are not really viable for example alliance standings are carefully and deliberately managed i dont think that people would appreciate a game mechanic that could effect the standings set by a pc alliance beyond that if those with no standing come into the space of a 00 alliance people will attempt to destroy them for sport so while i like that part of the idea i cant think of a way to make it work i wish i could though because more people visiting 00 means more pvpwhat could work is for those who do have standing to run missions in the space of their allies for example hydra could run missions npc or pc created for pure agents or whatever
i dont know about the playerbased missions but having agents in 00 stations makes a lot of sense when you consider the risk reward ratio for currently being in 00 is very poor when you can make the same per hour in empire running l4 missions for no risk at all
good idea if people in empire can run missions why not add some more reward to the hardest thing in the game to own a station owned by a corporation
uhm you got it wrong ankhwe need npc agents in player controlled 00player controlled 00 is horribly broken isk wise if i get into 17belt 056 system and only find battlecruiser npcs in 2 of them with rest of the belts empty then something is really wrong not to mention it takes 1520 minutes to check all the belts in a battleshipyet lvl4 combat missions generate guaranteed stream of ships to shoot at isk and its done with no risk whatsoevermake it possible for alliances to rent npc combat agents for a monthly fee or something there were ideas to link agent level to sov lvl4 agent in sov4 system etc but it would probably not be fair to smaller alliances
i dont like the specific ideas you have but the general idea of having missions more of all the services really in 00 sounds good to meadding faction agents chosen from a list dictated by the owners standings perhaps to office outposts seems an obvious way to make them more popular although the conquerable stations should get some love too
the details of your player mission system sound more like an open mercenary contract than a mission in any conventional sense make them contracts or equivalent not agents more npc agents in 00 is a fairly good idea but pc agents just sounds like bad terminology
yessimple method add an outpost upgrade that supports and agent low middle and hightier providing level 12 3 and 4 agents respectivelybuy the upgrade in amarr space for an amarr agent caldari space for a caldari agent etcadditional bonus low level agents give very new players an accessible way to make isk in 00 this was a problem i faced when trying to recruit very new players into a pvp corp sure they could strap on a mwd and a scramweb and be useful but they had no way to support themselves in between fights
needs work but its a good start
1 mission runner does empire missions2 mission runner migrates to 003 mission runner finds out that step 1 killed his standings thus making it impossible to do 00 missions4 mission runner uses noobcorp alt to start missions while his main does them then he relises that 95 of missions are just standard lvl4 ones and most pirate lp stores are total crap 5 mission runner thinks wtf faction pirate ammo is worse than high sec whats the pointfix the above then you can take the next step
you misunderstand the whole pos concept the only reasons people make poss is1 making mega billionsweek from moon mining2 as above but from making simplecomplex reaction for t2 production chain3 to claim sov so nobody can steal that station the alliance charges 10 refinery tax on4 bridge points either for bridges or for safe places for carriersjump frightors to cyno to etc5 to build supercaps with6 group of isk farmerminer style players put a small up so they have a drop off point very rare but you do get people who think pos refining is cool because they cannot afford a rorqurelpos is not something people put up for the sake of it poss only exist in the bigger picture to make isk or to support the securitylogistic of other poss making iskall your pos missions are obsolete because the alliance gets a automatic evemail with location of enemy pos in their soverign space the second someone puts a pos up who gets the reward for someone bringing 400 players in caps to blow up a dyso moon that earns the owner 20bilmonth worth of rare reactions because thats whats happening in 00 atm
lalala ankh still has good idea needs serious polishing but still good fundamentals
you know how hard it is to get a fight in alliance heald 00 people will kill their alts in noobships to do your search  destroy missions such missions would mean you would have to wait for someone to raid you and then have the balls to fight most alliance comqurable space is used by cowardly players who would dock up than do anything elseall the rest of your missions are made obsolete by jump bridges haul escort deliver etc etc all these missions would turn out to be nothing more than someone undocking in a hauler and warping to a pos and taking the jump bridge network to destination travel 50 jumps in 2 minutes in any hauler due to pos portalsonly acquire mission make sense and even then outpost owners would dip into the refinery tax fund to instacomplete these missionsmissions in outposts is bad  npc station only pls we need to encorage people to do missions in dangerous space not high sec carebear or 00 cearbear spacefw style missions please because teh fw missions are proper pve in pvp space missions but have them without 50 jump round trip npc 00 space so people can dock and buy stuff unlike alliance 00 which is 100 jumps away from the nearist dockable station
the player made missions are terrible and id rather they improved other aspects of 00 instead of making eve more into missions online
a nice addition to 00 outpost would be to make the trade tax payable to the outpost owners instead of the trade commission i was very surprised to learn that wasnt already implemented
are these issues for voting in csm meetings or ideas for discussion and development if they are the later maybe the jita park forum is more appropriatetake carearithron
ive always wondered about dynamic npc agents although only really from the point of view of high sec if my corp owns a pos and manages to get the corporate standing with a particular npc corp above a certain level then a poor quality level 1 agent from that corp visits the pos and hands out missions there  gradually improving in quality as the corp standing with his agency improves eventually upgrading to a poor level 2 and so onbut anyway  supported because agents and missions in nil sec would stop the nil seccers whining about how broken risk vs reward is in empire thereby lessening the risk to my preferred occupation of high sec mission running 
if normal agents normally become migratory in some fashion i could see the more heavily farmed ones meandering out into player 00 through some undefined mechanism i could see them leaving just as easilyits really a shame about l4s in highsec being the best riskreward in the game im sure if the game was done over again they would only be in low and nullsec i suppose making 00 actually more profitable for joe pod pilot would inflate the economy uncomfortably but it is still irksome
no sov  no cyno jammers no new outposts
as ankh is a member of the csm if her ideas get a good response she can bring it upas for the idea if an alliance can create an indestructible outpost why cant they contract with npc corps they are in good standing with to open a branch office you get 1 npc corp per station they each bring their own benefitsdraw backs some will refuse better contracts bring higher level agents not a bad idea really
just this part of the start gives the impression its an idea for developmentdiscussion not something that will potentially in its current form be coming up on the agenda im well aware that she can raise it at a meetingari
this might be a good way to let 00 alliances get involved in faction wars they pick a faction then they get that factions agents in their sov4 constellations might be easier to put them out in space instead of a station whichever is easier to make happen would also be good to put some level 12 agents in just so new players in 00 who cant handle 00 belt rats yet have something they can do solo mostly its just sad that eves endgame 00 space is so sparsely populated and some of the oldest pilots in the game never leave empire because the isksafety ratio is too good there there are obvious concerns about inflation but this is a problem that needs to be addressed
the idea of npc mission agents in conquerable space is a good onethat said there should be ways to differentiate between the varying qualities of space truesec presumably should affect effective quality as it does in low and high sec this would prevent a homogenisation of space but also serve to protect the lower quality space which is available to less powerful alliances such as that in providence if all 00 had high quality moneyspinning agents able to support effectively limitless numbers of players until motsu lag kicked in then the starter space would attract the attention of bigger alliancesthis would also help answer the overpopulation of much of 00 outside of the major power blocs there has only been drone space added in 00 over a period when the game population has massively increasedit would also provide a bit of variety for those who just cant face four more hours jumping from belt to belt chaining bs spawnsfinally if the proceeds were rich enough this might attract rich corps of mission runners who would illadvisedly set themselves up in a good truesec 00 system renting the space from alliances and providing nice gankable targets for roaming gangsps  pccreated missions would be gamed into absurdity in no time flat that bit is a whole different idea and not a good one in practise
im up for just about anything that adds incentives to 00the only thing im concerned about with 00 is the riskreward it should be a risk to move out to 00 and try to set up shop but there should also be a great amount of potential reward for it i like the current amount of risk but the reward could be buffed and agents seem like a great idea
the only good part about this is the original question there are outposts floating around in 00 so why no agentsthe entire concept of an alliance creating missions for its players is something that could only be invented by a highsec mission runner in reality when an alliance needs to get something done they say hey join the fleet weve got something to do there is no room time or reason to create a mission for it adding new complex game systems for things which are already well handled socially is an incredible waste of resourcesbesides we already have contracts for most of the stuff that this covers and the rest is nonsense a mission for sieging a pos are you joking the rest of this could be handled by improving the contracts window search options without any complicated agents changes most importantly the basic problems of 00 go entirely unaddressed
these mission mke no sence to anybody apart from the high sec carebear or the 00 carebear which is just the high sec carebear who thinks he is tough because he is doing the same carebear stuff but in 00if you want to promote pve in 00 then promote lvl4lvl5s in npc 00 regions which are impossible to cynojam you do not want to promote pve in conqurable space for the obvious reasion
this thread should be titled ankhs mission ideas as not all effect 00 and even less effect playerowned space
these are all great ideas i too have thought that itd be nice to have player created or at least player initiated missions in both low and high sec space i really liked some of the ideas you put forth along those lines supported
im not sure if ank intended this or not but a main escorting an alt would be pointless if the player initiated missions were paid out by the player and not by the game itself
this
i thought about it and exploration is a more elegant system with all the complexity and dynamism of missionrunning what 00 and lowsec needs are more reasons to be in belts
the first thing youve ever said that i can agree with from an ic point of view sansha agents are in sansha stations why would they want to be in an rkk station why would iron want to have a hostile entity the serpentis shoot at every iron ship they see with an office in one of their stations taking up one of their office slotsfrom an ooc point of view the people who own the station would have their own captive little iskmaking machine only an idiot who has never left high sec would come up with an idea like thatwhat you mean like people hiring out research poses hiring mercs oh i know how about courier missionswaaaait a minute they already do that in game waaaait a minute they already do that in gamewaaaait a minute they already do that in gamewaaaait a minute they already do that in gamewaaaait a minute they already do that in gamewaaaait a minute they already do that in gamewaaaait a minute they already do that in gamewaaaait a minute they already do that in gamewaaaait a minute they already do that in gamewhat you means like get into gang or you get kicked this is a corp mining op participate or we cant afford our corp ship replacement planyou know some day you really should join a player corp and see what a mmo is like when you play with other peopleyou mean like  um  a pos
it is sad to see csm members who have never pvped or lived in 00 putting out 00 ideasreading up on other crap csm are doing it is not surprising i mean look at black ops i doubt any csm member has black ops at lvl1 yet they seem to think the black ops fixt is by making transport ships jump with themsigh no wonder devs no longer take players seriously anymore
can you please repost your opinion of the op 34 more times i think some of us are still a little unclear on exactly where you stand
in right after the torrent of are you insane posts00 is supposed to be ruled by the players and you want to bring npcs and scripted missions into it more rewards and stuff to do is greatly needed in 00 but a mission that tells you to go defend this pos no one cares about for 2 hours isnt exactly the exciting changes 00 denizens hope for
imho it would be enough to move lvl 4 to lowsec i remember flying lvl 5 missions on sisi never heard of anyone flying them on tranquility nobody bothers teaming up with other ppl in lowsec risking ships when you can solo lvl 4 missions 237 in highsec without any riskbut i highly doubt ccp will ever move every lvl 4 agent out of high sec because of massive upcoming carebearwhine so how about keeping lvl 4 agents in high sec but remove isk rewards for missions remove bounty and drop less loot only keep lprewards if you want to fly lvl 4 in the current form you would have to move to lowsec
sigh1 isk buying is only a problem when you have impatient s who think they deserve to always fly factionfit pwnships and think they should be disposable the gms can handle this quite nicely2 for every subscription they lose to a ragequitter 3 more will come because the game because there are actually goals now 3 see 24 if youre running level 4 missions you are not a new player no one here has suggested nerfing level 2 or 1 missions
agree with the first part however i know of people who did level 5s on tranquility myself included  they arent worth the effort as they paid quite badly last i did themwhat youve said about low sec isnt true its most likely you are misinformed 00 pilot
lowsec missions were boosted quite a bit last i read they paid some 60k lpmission
ah i didnt know that thanks for the info
loot was boosted to so level 5 missions are quite nice now however that doesnt change the fact that you can run level 4s solo and do so semi afk without having to worry about any real risk
no support there really isnt a problem with the way things are set up now1 most high quality level iv agents are either located in low sec or give missions for low sec2 ive never seen a level v agent in high sec3 loot is much better in missions found in low sec for instance ive never heard of faction fittings being found in a high sec mission at least not reacently there were some missions rumored to give faction stuff regularly but those have been considerably dialed back and i dont think it was occuring in high sec even thensummary in terms of loot isk from bounties mission payment mission bonuses and loyalty points low sec missions already give a substantially greater payout than high sec missions additionally level v missions simply dont exist in high sec and they pay out just a little better than any level ivsthis just seems like another plan to force people out of high sec so they can be easy preywindjammer
posting in a very silly yet popular thread for kicks
who are running lvl 4s solo thats absurdoh wait youre talking about all the players who actually play the game and utilize many of its intended purposes sarcasm the same players that you think you can put a value on their time and their play style the players that pay for and have always been freely able to play as they wishpersonally i think if you want to put in the time to run a dozen lvl 4s then so be it they are putting in just as much time as you maybe they just utilize their time more constructively rather than camping for countless hours to finally kill a noob caracal and chestpop like you are uber at what you doget a clue
this is along the same lines as losing connection with dronesif you could reestablish your connection with drones and probes then there wouldnt be so much junk floating about all the timeyou could cancel your probes when youre done and you could recover your drones after your dc emergency warp always leaves them stranded
yes getting your stuff in space back when you disconnect seems like a good plan to me same as what i said on the drones ewarping thread
devblogtheres several issues with it1 the loss of techlabapi discussion2 the crime and punishment forum description is misleadingpiracy scams mercenaries and more carebears beware cp invokes the dark side of eves nature3 the market discussion description doesnt really tell what its all aboutshare stock tips or get the inside scoop on tradingnotice its the current description4 evetv forum  unless the tournament is completely dead are we supposed to spam all our questions to steviesg on the general discussion forum5 player gathering and events is not a gameplay area it should be in the communication center6added dont merge the events and the forum should not be merged with the player gathering forumunless ccp is willing to actually make some changes these forum changes should not be implemented any time soon
agreed the techlab is invaluableas to the evetv forum i wouldnt hold your breath for another tournament that the evetv forum has been condemned to the graveyard is somewhat indicative of ccps current attitude towards evetv
fixed it for youalso wtb builtin search feature that works
id also like to hear about what is actually being done to improve the underlying forum code
agreed dont fix what arent broken
according to the information we got at csm meetings there wont be any underlying forum code but i would like to be proven wrong
can i also add that the forum needs a complete redesign and new tech behind it the forum here is less than useful compared to how it could be check out the forums at quartertothreecom for an example of a good setup and tech we need to be able to send pms mark forums read sort things to our liking and many other things i hear rumor that theyre working with a third party on this but can we get a status report
backing this the loss of an official place to discuss the development of third party tools ie the tech lab is no good thing and as far as i could see from the proposed new structure theres no reasonable alternative place to post about these projects which makes me sad
agreed on the above being completly bonkers and hopefully the result of someones brainfart already stated so a bit more elaborate in the devblog comments thread
oh and please dont get rid of eve technology lab
care to elaborate are they planning on using 3rd party forum software
signed the dev blog doesnt state why the forum is getting changed only that it will be for the worse
seems like changes are being made for changes sake
fix this place already merge it with the idea forum having both is needless clutter as most people dont bother with the other forum now that this whine express lane is in place and you must be here with your big issue sign to be seen
we need a forum for third party development the tech lab must stay
this
dammit i have to agree with lv
tech lab must be saved
it would definately be the wrong discussion to close down the tech lab most of the interesting stuff on the eo forums actually goes on here
i agree with lavista these forums dont need reshuffling of various areas they need a lot of feature upgrades
you can just trash them thats all theyre good for anyway
has my vote but there should be an evil choice too like selling off the slaves on the black market would require going to low sec
yes but the rewards are so good for rescuing her ill happily unlock her door just to let her get away some more caldari should have the option to convert slaves into data entry clerks for the relevant corporation although the distinction there may be mere semantics this is not true  at least the part about losing standing  you only lose standing if you get caught and once you get over a certain standing level with the faction whose space you are in they no longer scan you i had been collecting contraband in caldari space for about a year and decided to run some missions in amarr territory i tend to carry everything in my freighter and because i had not been scanned down for months forgot that my standing in amarr space wasnt quite so good as it was in caldari about 3 jumps in i got jumped by the cops and got hit by a big fine about 15 mil isk total i think and standing loss moved back to caldari space soon after and have not had a problem since
yet more positive feedback thankyouwould any csm 3 omber btw but amirite in thinking alternates cannot propose stuffs for meetings care to share their opinions on this matter i feel its a simple one that could improve diversity of setups and bring a lot of stuff out of uselessness with little risk of creating gamebreaking setups and overpowered rigs purely because the aim is to have less stats stacking up to huge multiples of their original number not more it would also not take vast amount of dev time to implementon a related note how would it be for people if rigs were forcing diversity by only be allowed to fit one of any rig i tried to acheive that idea in the op without a hard limit but now i think about it it does make sense  after all you cant replace your engine housings with polycarbon material more than once can you
nice idea
we really need this feature for modules we have at least giant secure containers with their logs but for ships we have absolutely nothing to protect from thieves
this is the clumping problem rather than the obedience problem the drones are bumping each other thus interfering with each others navigation ive lost drones this way on more than one occasionyou can also seperate them by telling one of the two drones to go do something else and then telling it to do what you really want it to but its a cumbersome and slow process to do it usually right in the middle of a situation where you just dont have time to do all that extra messing about with the drones which should be working correctly in the first placeregardswindjammer
would be nice if this was responded to ive had all of the problems from 12 drones moving to different targets drone clumping another one i found was not going around a pos towers shield i told them to engage a battery on the other side of the tower within control range they ran directly for it hit the shield bumped it for a little while i got annoyed recalled them and deployed sentries
i see absolutely no reason why this would in any way specifically benefit gallente above all others   kudos windjammer    you more or less have unanimous support   wow    thats so rare   i feel like this is the twilight zone or something   lo
i generally support this though you wouldnt need to remove lvl 4s from hi sec if you had dynamic agent quality and tied the bounties from the npcs to the agent quality and or system security status
1 missions need to be made more dynamic and unpredictableyes 2 mission payout in lowsec and 00 needs improvementdefinitely the automatic equation should take in to account the security of the system that mission takes place in and the agents location possibly this is moving any agent with a really high quality is in low sec3 module loot has a negative impact on the economy by making t1 production obsolete and injecting too many minerals into the economythis is huge a player running a l4 mission should not be able to make in minerals the same amount as a dedicated miner does in half the time4 missions in factional warfare require improvementsthere needs to be a warning  these are intended to be done as a group secondly the reward for a bonus needs to be higher lastly the missions beacon should not appear until 1 the owning player enters system or 2 warps to the mission5 mining missions require improvementsyes6 agents are static resulting in overloaded mission hubs desire to have agent quality made dynamici like the the idea of it being dynamic based on the number of missions they give out per dayweeketc this should result in distribution of pilots across multiple systems which in turn helps to reduce lag7 level 4 missions in their current form do not belong in highsecurity spacei think the above will help to take care of this a bit 8 standing is being monopolized by missions no ways to get standing outside of mission running with the exception of fw standingthe challenge here is what do you include there are other ways killing rats killing npc haulers moving between stations but yes there is no way to increase your standings with npc organizations outside of missions or complexes in fw
1 i was waiting for one of the csm to seriously raise this issue
1 im not a very good pilot2 i tend to play when i am tired as late at night is often the only time in the day i can spare when falling asleep is a viable cause for concern you dont want to be taxing your brain with high levels of concentration 3 even when im awake my attention span isnt good  i swear i have add or something4 i dont respond well to criticism and advice despite knowing this about myself i am very reluctant to experiment with my fit5 even though i am caldari i cannot yet fly a raven the missioners ship of choice it seems and couldnt hit the side of a barn with a missile  i fly a megathron and shoot guns6 i am a casual player even on a good week i rarely manage more than 78 hours of play at the moment i have so much else going on that i am spending a lot more time on the forums than i am in game7 i have tried level 4s now and then over those 18 months every time i tried them i lost my ship in the first one i tried having successfully completed level 4 wc though im confident i will be able to run 4s after i finish farming 3s for lp to get a cnr to swap for a navy megai play eve the way i enjoy i wont bore you with the reasons why i dont follow other professions or activities in eve but missions are about all i do i dont farm them  i hardly ever buy anything off the market and rarely sell anything that drops  i just enjoy doing them building my standings and providing my corp with a bit of subsistence income to help keep the pos in fuelthis is why i am so against level 4s being moved to low sec that would force me to do pvp which i avoid like the plague because i dont enjoy it i am really bad at it and every time i lose a ship it takes me weeks to recover i would rather leave the game and free up those 78 hours a week to spend them more with my partner or just sleep than be forced to be exposed to everything i dont enjoysorry for the whine  apparently i enjoy playing the martyr as well
tip if you have the isk its considerably more costeffective to just buy a 400m isk cnr than farm the 600k lp  spare raven for it turn your lp into implants  faction ammo which gives a much better rate of returnthat to the side i appreciate your dilemma but surely you can see that those who are prepared to risk their ships and make the effort to form teams should have access to better rewards than those who dont by the sound of it you are quite prepared to run level 3s anyway and by your own admission are better suited to themhaving said that if missions are reformed in nature as well as location then you might find them considerably more engaging and maybe not nod off while doing them i can sympathise with this running missions back to back for a few hours is pretty soporiffici notice your are a member of a corp what are their thoughts would you not give each other support arrange scouts create intel channels negotiate with local pirates etc if you missioned in losec missioning in losec is risky but there are many many ways to reduce that risk if people care to try
i prefer less blobs and betterharder enemies automatically reduces loot less npcs probably increases chance for better meta level loot to compensate some ideaswhy for example does a rat never warp out and come back later partiallyfully repaired there could be a small repair station in the deadspace at x km for example players are then rewarded if they warp scramble the npc let a npc bs make use good use of drones all this talk about nanos and i have never seen an npc go faster then 500 ms except some spider drones have neutscram towers in lvl 4 missionsbetter chance to find faction loot less but more powerful enemies will do that dont know about fw but seems a good ideasurewould be nice but maybe its easier simply to add some more agents of the same quality in quiet regions i dont see why not i think they are just fine in high sec easy to say if you live in 00 or low sec maybe by helping the factions war effort by supplying t1 items in exchange for a standing increase with diminishing returns
yes absolutely no argument there i would prefer though that reward is increased elsewhere than nerfed where i am however as i know that i can make a living running 3s off a decent agent i am equally sure i can make as good a living off a poor level 4 agent i am not convinced though that the type of player who enjoys nil or low sec life will enjoy missionrunning there but it takes all sorts so im sure there will be a fewi die in low sec within minutes usually its only since i trained up cov ops frigs and cov ops cloaking device that ive been able to run the courier missions that step into low sec and ive even podded under full cloak as well thanks for the education there m4n1cm1n3r my death to jump ratio in low sec was about 13 before the buzzard  so i just didnt go therei dont enjoy pvp so i dont go low sec i had the level 3 new horizons mission a while ago and stage 7 one of the most rewarding happened to fall into low sec i had no compunction in refusing the mission and moving along i will fly through low sec if i absolutely have to but i will not fight there lord knows my friends from earlier corps who have long since moved on into nil sec some bobaffiliated some goonaffiliated and others with different loyalties still constantly try to get me to come to nil sec and make better use of my 11 mil sps in gunnery but its just not for mei think that the options should be better for those who do enjoy pvp though  just because i dont like it is no reason to punish those who do and the increased risk should definitely  increased reward the same argument goes the other way as well of course
1 missions need to be made more dynamic and unpredictableif missions were less farmable and more challenging this would increase the fun for carebears like me but also the risks which would alleviate some of the anticarebear gripes also i fully agree with malcanis on this if pve was more like pvp meaning fittings and tactic required esp at level 3 and 4 going low sec and dealing with pirates would be less of an issue2 mission payout in lowsec and 00 needs improvementtrue i currently see no valid financial reason to mission low sec because the risk is too hight compared to the reward however i still think this wont entice many missioners to go low sec nor do i think that current low sec dwellers will start doing missions this change would promote fairness but wouldnt change much else3 module loot has a negative impact on the economy by making t1 production obsolete and injecting too many minerals into the economytrue missioning shouldnt be mining and there should be different kind of rewards so that both professions have a valid place just to be clear it shouldnt be a way to punish carebearism which seems high on the agenda of some louder voices 4 missions in factional warfare require improvementsdont know about this one since i havent been in fw yet5 mining missions require improvementsdont know about this one never done one6 agents are static resulting in overloaded mission hubs desire to have agent quality made dynamicim not sure about this one is it really solving a problem or just an attempt to make life harder for missioners i agree some mission hubs are quite busy so solving that would be good it could also just lead to an amount of silliness with people moving around a lot and accomplishing nothing much 7 level 4 missions in their current form do not belong in highsecurity spacethis is the plea of low sec pirates wanting a nice target rich environment of expensive ships they can blow up in organised gangs while the solo missioners are just rolling the dice every time they fly out ill admit that there are problems with rewards on several issues missions being too static and farmable rewards being too high for missions pvp  pirating not rewarding enough but this is not a good solution pirates are often quite vocal so they can be heard far and wide but that doesnt mean that they know how to solve problems with missions they do now how to solve their own problems in a riskfree way for them only if ccp considers missioning without pvp shouldnt be a valid carreer option for combat players more then 6 months old should they even remotely consider thisthere are problems so lets solve them just dont solve them in a way that cuts out the legs under one professional option to the advancement of another professional option8 standing is being monopolized by missions no ways to get standing outside of mission running with the exception of fw standingtrue  but there are several types of missions for several professions so whats wrong with this perhaps the types of mission need to be expanded or a bit more freeform like a tag office where you can turn in criminal tags for standing and a payment instead of formally accepting a mission to kill criminals but i dont see how else this would be accomplished in conclusionyeah missioning could use some changes esp at the high end the challenge should be harder in an interesting way not just more firepower andor npcs there are some issues with reward vs risk and missioning shouldnt make a profession like mining or manufactoring unrewardingbut really lets talk solutions that keep missioning open as a valid and fun career option and dont give in to anticarebear sentiment esp that of pirates demanding easy targets in low sec
mineral prices are low because of the macro miners supply vs demand my friend the problem is they are artificially low because a macro miner doesnt place a price on his or her time since they are not actively wasting it they only place a price on the mineral which means actually mining as oppose to macro mining is far less rewarding than it should beyes this would make everything else more expensive but i have no problem with that as it would bring mining more into a reward balance with missions it would also be a significant boost to low sec and 0 mining because those areas would be easier to mine than grabbing missions in high sec
when did i mention miners scanning things out they can if they want to mine someone elses mission but if they want to mine they can just get a mission of their ownthe whole point is to give some downside to high sec and make mining more difficult for macro miners inside empire space where they are safe more or less you can still mine you just need to work at it just like mission runners do in high sec we can make more money ratting and running in 0 but we choose not to because the risk is higher and some people simply dont want to risk it regardless of the reward getting an agent is easy getting the right mission is easy just make one type of agent entirely mining missions and problem solvedi agree that lvl 5s are basically pointless the additional risk involved comes no where near the reward from what we can currently tell
1 agreed2 agreed3 there is a thread in features and ideas forum where the devs are talking about removing t1 loot drops and replacing them with componants for manurfactoring t1 and possibly tii named meta itemsthis would boost the mineral markets as well as the mining profession as that would be a lot less loot being reprocessed into mineralswould also be a great boost to industry i believe this to be the best solution to removing ti loot which is mostly worthless anyway4 5 and 6 agreed7 removing missions to low sec or otherwise nerfing them is not the solution imo and will cause more problems than it solveslast time the devs tried to nerf lv4 missions when they were planning level 5 6 and 7 missions it caused a mutiny of complaints on the forums and if forced through would be very damaging to the game as you pointed out a lot of players would quit8 supported the main reason i grind missions atm is not for the isk but for the standings needed to use jump clones put up empire poss use research agents ectalternative methods of raising standings would definately be welcomeoveral you have assessed the situation with a mostly unbiased viewpoint for which i aplaud and supportthank you
damb dude change your aftershave or something  youre attracting pirates way too much i dont even see people on gates in a 19 ratio if youre getting caught that often  or at all in a covops  youre doing something very wrongactually you might be able to spin a lucrative career as a baitship pilot a supertanked domi or scorp can absorb a huge amount of punishment and some people by which i mean me would love to have such a proficient pirateprocurer in gang more seriously solo play is the problem here pirate are working in coordinated teams youre doing stuff solo the results are as predictable as the solution is obvious in my experience when people say i dont like pvp what they actually mean is i dont like always losing at pvp fair enough i guess but its very possible to remedy that
wtf  how are you still alive missions give your brain rotin fact this probably has impaired your judgement and the game would be better without you you bring nothing but lag whining and market disruptionanyway yeah supported
cant argue with lag  whining but not market disruption no  i hardly ever use the market except to buy several ten thousand rounds of ammo and a few drones to replace lossesnot everyone who runs missions is a farmer doing it because its the best reward for minimum risk
simple and elegant i like itespecially compared to ccps proposal
i approve1 shc
i support this idea was also thinking what about if activating a mwd reduces your agility therefore in a straight line you can reach same speeds but decreases your ability to orbit at high speeds
note ive not read the eight pages of commentary and am responding to the op onlyi like the idea in principle though i think that the implementation you suggested would make make mwds completely obsolete for combat ships combat ships would need to have an ab to increase mobility in combat and mounting both is prohibitive on most ships for grid and slot reasonsas an alternative id propose that mwds be changed to operate in several modes the fullspeed mode would work as you suggested granting high combat speeds at the expensive of firepower a reducedspeed mode would give ablevel mobility but allow full combat capability switching modes would be accomplished either by use of a script or automatically the speed boost is damped whenever the ship activates weapons and remains damped for some cooldown period after they are deactivatedin effect this would allow a ship to mount a normal ab and a noncombat mwd in a single slotas you said certain things like polycarbs and snakes will still need some adjustment
i like your alternative of 2 mode  off drive as long as cap is returned for ab mode
thats bogus mwd will still be better for positioning in a fight and reaching your target in any possible waysupportin the op
sarm is smarter than me thus i must concur
tldr but if sarmaul started it i support it with my hadns and feetsarmaul  ccp tbfh
nothing is going to change their minds but ok
from the looks of it you could be wrong on this one
im honestly sick and tired of thiscorp were forming a roaming gangme what should i bringcorp you fly a vaga duhme i can actually fly two entire races worth of ships need anything elsecorp oh yeah then bring the ishtarme facepalmi would really like to see some of the other ships that i can theoretically fly become somewhat useful this century
well if you play a mmo game just for missions maybe you should find some nice single player game it will cost you less i agree that changes like this are a bit drastic the quantity of missions could be changed or rebalancing hisec lvl4 missions could be in another way but you are wrong the lack of agentrunners who rarely wanders to lowsec to pvp will be highly compensated with new agentruneers who will run missions in lowseci dont think agentrunners contribute to significant part of the market cause they lose ships very rarelyagentrunners you are describing who rarely come to lose their ship in lowsec have no good loot already if no lvl4s in highsec i think we could see some nice faction ships to come in lowsec to run missions alliances have ratting belts carebears should not be already buying deadspace stuff cause of suicide ganks i can speak for this very confidetly i was scanning many agentrunners ships for several weeks now and scanned hundreds ships i can tell that in very packed and some mediocre packed hubs i have found less than ten pilots who has fits worth more than 1 bil but on the other hand deadspace gear prices are rising go figureyou shouldnt ever buy isk its against eula if people need isk they can buy some gtc and sell them for isk good for them good for ccpyes ithink people will gank agentrunners in lowsec
short answer you are deluded if you think that people will bring a fat ship in low sec especially if it cost several months to get it
long answerjust for missions no but they make a important part of eve for a good percentage of the players make the mission practically unavailable and you will lose players after spending a month to get a bs running 1 missionday no one will risk it in low sec someday open the map and look the high sec ship losses beside the ship losses even teh change in ammunition consumption will change the market to repeat you are deluded if you think that someone will easily risk a ship for wick he spent a month doing missions so alliances will be ratting belts to get faction and officer mod that no one ill buyand you think that if a similar drastic change was implemented rats bounties will stay the same the bounties were incremented to compensate the ease of getting missions if this idea was implemented the belt rats would give the same rewards as mission rats you are deluded again you seem guided by the thought that agentrunners love to lose ships to pirates no they find it annoying if they are rick if they are poor they find it devastatingthis idea will make them poor so they will not risk devastating losses
nanos make important part of eve too so do suicide gankers so do nos users so do lvl4 hisec agentrunners so what  if it happens one aspect of game outweights others something should be done right now no other profession grants more riskless money like missions sure you can trade billions sitting in jita but you need to always babysit your orders and its limited no supply no items for you no profit missions are unbalanced you can do as many of them as you want its unlimited source of money a little investment to faction gear caldari navy nobody suicide ganks for this and you can earn nice money but in lowsec you can do more missions not 5 i said it can be changed to other numer or other mechanic like quality you could do lvl4s in highsec but get crap rewards and go to lowsec to get nice rewards risk vs rewards like devs are telling us you mission for 1 hr and have a new t2 fit ship after insurance or you can do missions in high sec and earn that amount money in like 5 or 7 hrs oh yeah i have never heard about wars aswell free market economy less demand less profit some producers will switch to other goods well if you dont want to risk dont come out of highsec do less proditable highsec missions if you spend one month to get a t2 fit ship you might aswell uninstall the game
so why you deleted the part where i showed that expensive mods wont lose their value they are not used only by agentrunners you seem dont understand what is wrong today ok lets say we have simiral earning with both lvl4s in hisec and ratting in 00 so what would most people choose  of course lvl4s cause there is only tiny bit of risk i could say there is no risk at all in 00 you earn less cause you cant rat 247 gangs roam and what if some guy decides to afk cloak in your system  again you can sit in highsec

how do you propose to handle corp insured shipsand dont say  mail ceodirectors
i support this idea as a pos manager i know how soul destroying large scale logistics are experienced large scale pos workers have even authored php or xml based fuel managers to deal with pos management this idea would simplify life to an unimaginable degree i wholeheartedly support this issue
i agreemy post in greyscales thread
ive noticed more than once that insurance has been quite a contentious issue in eve it is currently on a provisional schedule for removal with the next coming patch some have proposed that insurance should be completely removed but i believe there is a middleground  adding realisminsurance is a business of risk it makes little sense for an insurance company to offer the same benefits to pilots with starkly different safety recordsin short the modifications proposed are those who rarely lose ships can receive full insurance benefits current system those who regularly lose ships will have to pay higher premiums and receive lower payouts the insurance one receives is based on recent activity eg insured ships lost in the last montha possible addition devolve insurance to the factions make it possible to insure with corporations loyal to your faction so your standings are made to matter more this would be particularly useful for the faction militias
and i support this idea scagga

great even more carebear buffs
so in short the 00 players get the shaftplease consider the economics of attacking a cynojammed system you need battleships dozens and dozens and lots and many of them the casualties are like a scene from the wild bunch its horrifically expensive even with insurance and a majority of such attacks fail meaning that you often have to try 2 3 even 4 timestldr sov3 becomes virtually unbreakable unless the participants are wildly overmatched
i do visit 00 often and i find you can make a lot more money there isnt it true that the richest groups in the game live in 00 dont you think this will encourage those few with obscene wealth to help equip their armies perhaps havent many people in 00 been complaining about insurance alltogether furthermore arent more ships are lost in empire space than 00i might be wrong though please point out if im not understanding this rightthe cynojammer issue is something completely different that does in my opinion need addressing elsewhere
people should not be punished even further for pvp what you propose would be a serious disincentive to people getting into itthe only people that would benefit from this are high sec missionerstraders there are already too few incentives for playerscorps to move into low sec00 making their losses hurt even more is the exact oposite of the way changes should be goinginsurance may have issues theres no denying it you only have to look at tii insurance rates but anything that is a disincentive to pvp is just a horrible direction to move in this game would be absolutely terrible if it were restricted to pve the game as it stands cannot exhist without it
dont agree pvp would suffer too much with this change
hello eve population thank you for taking the time to read this proposalas an avid trader i do love the eve economy my experiences have indicated that there is however plenty of untapped potential the improvements i would suggest are as followscontracts the standing orderin eve it is not uncommon for contractual agreements to be formed between different corporations between the members of single corporation or between independent individuals for regular business however it can become tedious to constantly renew contracts or send new requests based on changing demandsthis is where a standing order can help the standing order would be a feature of contracts renewing a contract under conditions set by the user eg corp a is contracted by corp b of 00 alliance c to maintain their pos fuel supplies at their empire stockpile at a certain level the standing order tool will set up a contract at an interval set by corp b requesting whatever amount of whatever product is needed to keep the stockpile at the agreed level if demand changes the contracts will automatically adjustthis example can be modelled to many situations faced when engaging in contracting in eve here the standing order greatly reduces workload and may allow more time to pursue more profitable activity furthermore it may allow pilots to be absent without worrying that a logistics chain will break down it may also allow business relations between corporations to reach a much higher level of complexity
ps i am very happy to modify the idea if feedback can point out ways to refine it further poh and i support my idea
yes the contract system needs improvement and streamlining its far better than escrow of course but theres still plenty of room for improvement and this is as good a start as any  contracts that do not expire upon acceptance but stay around either indefinitely or while some conditions are met good thinking
very good idea to increase corptocorp trading and logistics no downside i support
i was also thinking that contracts could be further enhanced if they allow temporary positive standings eg you hire a corp to do some logistics work for a time period they are automatically blue for the duration off that contract requires director status to enable such contracts it helps reduce the load on setting standings and makes it easier to enforce prompt completion of work ie your standings expire at xth of august
good idea it could even work for internal contracts within corpssupported
interesting mechanism
i hadnt think about that true
i especially like this idea supported
not sure if its viable or useful but wouldnt it be nice to have a cockpit view to tie in with ambulation and some tweaked controls to go along with it
wtf well i guess ccp wont be introducing cockpits
sighyoure piloting your ship from a goofilled pod not a co ckpit
enough pedantry
its not pedantry its how the game is it would be ed to have a cockpit view because the ships dont have cockpits we have pods instead would be completely incongruous with ambulation and the atmosphere of eve
the jovian wetgravecamera dronesread the above stories and then continue this discussionwhat youre seeing is the c0ckpit view your character is immersed in a sensory deprivation chamber filled with neutrient goo picture the matrixwhat youre seeing when you zoom in and out and pan around your ship is the video feed from the drones that supply info to the pilot withinthen when the pilot thinks to himself i want to kill that guy the ship locks on and starts firing
eve fluff ftw
you call it fluff i call it immersion thanks gideon for at least adding something to the discussion instead of just base eveo trolling
shameless bumpageanybody else wanna digg this and please read my original thread tht i linked
it would have been nice if you could have posted your idea here instead of a linki like the idea however i dont really see the problem with having fighters at all poss regardless of sec ratingi dont feel comfortable with the idea of a doomsday device on pos certainly not on one in anything but 00 even in 00 itd just be too powerfulregardswindjammer

in this general discussion thread it was asked how we could improve the war declaration system here are my suggestions1 increase the cost of creating a corporation significantly at least 100 million isk2 allow the defenders a onetime bribe of concord 50 million to postpone the beginning of the war for 1 week3 create a tangible means for displaying how a corporation can win a war  whenever the corporation starts the war they set out objectives includingisk destroyedships destroyed by typemembership reduced  or closing of corporationremoval of corporate offices4 when a corporation completes all their objectives or retracts the war without completing them it can be displayed from the corporate showinfo screen as medals gives victors bragging rights but also lets a defending corporation shame their opponents by denying them objectives5 allow defending corporations to involve a 3rd party in the wardeclaration system through mercenary contracts they will function the same as an offensive war dec complete with war medals with the exception that they pay no fee as long as the attacking corporation maintains the war6 inhibit corp hopping to prevent war declarations  whenever leaving a corporation at war players with roles must wait at least 72 hours before leaving the corporation
i dont like any of your ideas but i approve of them anywaythumbs up
i as someone who is certainly not tarminics alt also support this idea

yes it may sound crazyintroductionmany pilots have experience of seeing odd pirate gates either in missions or in 00 what if it were possible to search for hidden routes off the beaten path in my opinion making specialist knowledge like this available would serve tactically shorten trade routes and add to eves exploratory dimensionto find a hidden gateto find a hidden gate would require probing the gate would not be in workable condition when first found  and it would not be known where it leads to the gate would need repairs as well as an energy source cap charges to stay running when repaired possible addition i dont think this part would passif the gate is not managed it will fall into disrepair if the gate remains in a state of disrepair for a month it breaks down and can no longer be found ie is redistributed the reason i dont think this will pass is that the change may require a patch each time a gate needs to be changed programming hell tooconclusionif implemented this would increase the value of knowing ones home space  be beneficial on the combat mining trade etc fronts it would however foster a kind of responsibility maintaining the gate and on occasion  protecting it
supporting
additional information  these hidden gates would be located in low sec being of pirate construction
like the idea
has my support
further thoughts on the matter to be able to use a hidden stargate you also have to have the stargate it goes to operational in the instance that both gates are hidden
uhm there already are hidden stargates in the game they dont work anything like what you list here but they are thereyou just need to look around a lot to find them
the problem i have with this is that once the gates are found theyre just more gates except that they require reopening of the insta market all youre doing is hammering the jita server and expanding the warp network a little thats not really a good thing now you could fix that by making these gates highly transient but then who will search for them ultimately ill stick with the present method of creating new stargates  either get a titan or get sov 3 on both sides and use a jump bridge its not as interesting but it actually works
me nodsi would like to restate that the idea would have the gates as being exclusive to low sec there would at any time be a maximum number of hidden gates with upkeep requirements i imagine that the benefit of having these gates may encourage use of low sec eg pvpers traders resource users etc having a secret route to their basebut naturally as you said we must consider the serverside issues ill give the idea more thought for now
your skilled mechanic wouldnt be able to remove the speed governor for the same reason he cant make modifications to anything outside of fitting modules rigs and implantsin the end it really doesnt matter the storyline justification is merely added color and as ccp has shown on most changes isnt necessary at all once again the storyline justification can be made to fit or be entirely changed in content so that it will fitor be entirely absentas indicated in the op of this thread a speed cap is preferred instead of a nerfing of many items which effect speed the more modules implants and rigs you nerf the wider spread and more unpredictable the effects the point is it affects more than just speed when you do so so if speed is the only consideration nerf the speed and leave the rest aloneits simple its direct and its more controlled to hard cap the speeds of the ships as opposed to so many other changes four guys sitting down for 5 hours doesnt give me a lot of confidence in the outcome of their deliberations when so much is being affected by what they came up with other than speed even the dev blog itself indicates these are ideas they want input on and are not written in stone etc a clear indication that they themselves are not 100 certain all the nerfs will be beneficialwindjammer
i really dislike hard caps on speedit just seems like a crutch of the same type that you see in games with invisible walls sorry but i cant support this
i often have 300 items in my hanger and its a real pain to find the specific one that i want it would be extremely nice and relatively simple to implement on the client side a searchfilter for the hangerit would work like thisyou have a little search box in the top right of the items window when youre docked when you type into it the items window will show only items whose name contains the string youve entered case insensitive of course then to reset it you simply click the x or some other icon next to the box and the items window will display all items in your hanger againthis can be easily implemented client side so there will be no extra database load

suicide shipstheres a lot that can be said about their tactical usesa stepwise approach to explaining the idea further1 a highslot module 500m3 as an item to avoid easy transport that can hold a single bomb the same bombs that stealth bombers can currently use 2 fitting this module poses penalties for the shipa for a frigate the module will take up most of its grid leaving some extra grid that would accomodate a microwarpdrive with much difficultyb no weapons can be fitted  ie no guns launchers drones etcc armor and structure hitpoints are also reduced by 50 making room for the bomb charge  however this also reduces massd suicide ships do not pay out insurance3 to detonate the charge you need to activate the relevant highslot after arming the bomb which will instantly detonate the ship causing the same damage as the detonation of a normal bomb if a suicide ship is destroyed by hostile fire of any type the charges will fail to detonate this includes being hit by the blast of another suicide ship4 how much should a suicide ship cost i would proposea the module to hold the bomb 1mil isk needs to be invented from a cruise missile launcher bpcb the bomb charge itself correct me if im wrong are usually 26mil isk apiece so the cost for a suicide frigate would be approximately 510m isk5 legality suicide frigates being unethical weapons of war would be illegal in high security space  you will be concorded if you undock in one they can be assembled there however however unlike stealth bomber bombs they would work in low security space willing to concede that thats just a suggestion6 skill requirements to fit out a suicide frigate should require frigate 5 and the bomb deployment skilltheres more to say on the topic which i will add later
braces for the flamessupporting
i like this ideai have had a simular idea to this but would work for any shipramming speed would cause an explosion instead of a bump the damage caused would take into account the size of ships involved and relative speeds ie frigate hitting bs would dp little damage bs hitting a frigate if it could catch it would pretty much certainly destory the firgate while most likely leaving bs in tact if heavily damaged thso my idea was trounced by the physics being to difficult i like this one though as it reduces the need for impact physics d
i do think the idea of being able to send in homemade suicide frigates will scare the bejeezus out of blobsespecially if they are warped into a blob in a staggered formation which leaves me thinking should it be possible to set a fuse on the bomb in case of lag
nope people will just use blobs of these ships spread out further thoughout the grid 5mil cost each is a bit irrelevant even 50mil is not that expensive all that would happen is bunches of these ships doing logon traps and blobingbut spread out further etc etcnothing wrong with current blob at all lag is the bad thing people confuse blob with lag insted of fixing blobs you should be asking ccp to fix lag
consider thisthe suicide ship would possibly have an effective blast radius of 15km but will only do 8k of a particular damage this is not enough to destroy anything bigger than a cruiser i dont think that would be effective against a heavy fleet unless they were sent in a staggered formation the counter to the problem you have mentioned about login traps is different however  the counter to this may be a 510 second delay in detonationi would imagine the suicide ships best effective in a fleet battle sneaking through unnoticed into the midst of the battle to destroy swathes of drones wrecks pods halfdestroyed ships alone they would most likely not be fleet breaking but a hazard that could worry a light fleet faced by a small number of diehard defendersregarding the bloblag thing ive not suggested that either are a problem that this will deal with only what their effect may have on existing structures
wouldnt this just be adding another aoe weapon to fleet warfare never even seen a titan myself but isnt the amount of lag caused by a dd cripplingadding more aoe weapons seems as though it may be a step in the wrong direction with the current lag issues
so the reason why you dont agree with this is because of lag not because of actual gameplay ugh
dont get me wrong im not necessarily against it i just thik that implementing new features like this should come secondary to fixing the current issues and not be implemented at all if it has a further negative effect
soon 
me pictures a 200strong suicide frigate gang finding a titanok this idea sounds interesting it has my supportps make selfdestructing send out a 40km 5000hp shockwave all damage types make selfdestructing a viable pvp tool hehe
basically its a stealth bomber that can instantly fire insted of longer fuse this would hurt game balace a lot but the point is you have to clearly define what the problem with the blob is so you can design a niche ship to counter itbecause such a ship does not remove the blob people will blob away but with more distance between them in the grid or use even more numbers to make up for any losses the problem has not been solved it has been transfered and even then we do not know what the problem is
note a stealth bomber that blows itself up tooyes i otherwise agree  it does not remove the blob however we are cognizant that this was an application rather than the core purpose of the idea p
yes you cansearch for contracts as normal and set the minimum price to 1 isk it will now show all orders with a positive price  and therefore cut out all wtb contracts
contracts ui in general needs reworked
i support this idea free feature or as an new effect of contracting skill or even as a new skill for my simple view is always half filled with absolutly irrelevent contracts
more database filling and potential lag no thanks if you increase it now you will need to increase it again and again and again until jita is even more gridlockedhow about a little bit more thought into prevention not trying to be an ass btwi agree with the intent of the message just not the implementation so meh
join an alliance then it costs more to dec an alliance wardecs have already been nerfed once we dont need another one just because someone loves autopiloting their freighters through highsecas a counter i propose that you make it possible to dec single characters who are in npc corps this would prevent corporations and macrominers from exploiting npc corps as a safe haven from war decs
decs do not need a significant nerf id say make the cost proportional to size so that 150 man pvp corps have some incentive to target larger corps without removing the possibility of it if theres a real reason to its all about incentive
the only issue i see here is that you somehow feel you should be forming a corp when you have no way to defend yourself
some of the real worlds largest corporations started from a corner stall i think it should be possible to do that in eve as well
when you start a corp you raise a flag saying here i am in the big league now if youre not ready to defend your corp youre not ready to form a corp
it is entirelly possble you just have to live with and accept that you will get war decced and plan accordingly
looking at the last two dev blogs i would say ccp will be shortly with you holding your hand
something should be changedthere are tons of concerned pvpers that stronly demand for a strong nerf to npc corps and be honest 510 people buddy corps with all chars having less than 5mill sp are the target for a lot of peoples war decs even today its better to either stay in npc corps or go to 00 and mandatory join some large 00 alliance as a small corp will get even deader on its own in 00and everyone knows why 00 is starting to look silly yeey we loaded grid after 45 minutes now lets just hope that we load enemy ships eventually and forcing small corps into huge 00 blobs constricts the sandbox small corp will get wardeced in high sec obliterated by pirate corps with caps and supercaps in low sec and be completely absorbed in 00 not quite some choices you have there
thumbs up for general support of this idea however as mentioned previously in this thread ccp will be changing the war dec mechanisms in the near future they are aware of the griefing abuse and are intent upon making changes to alleviate itbest regardswindjammer
you cant remove nonconsentual pvp from eve im very carebearish and i still wouldnt want to see senseless boat violence nerfedyou could do one or two of fallowingdeclaring war on a corporation smaller than your corpalliance would be exponentially increasing in cost so if a 00 alliance wants to blow some annoying leeches out of the water in highsec just for the principle it can afford it but usualy it shouldnt be worth the  if a semi serious pirate corp with couple dozen players wants to war dec a 10 person newbie corp they would have to pay trough their nose second paying concord to delay war dec by one week only once per war scaling up on cost based on number of people in your corpthough even as i type those i see they would either be too ineffective or too good at preventing noncon pvp
the op has a point theres a lot of people who want to abuse the wardec system1 ill sit in the relative safety of highsec space2 ill be allowed to kill newbies3 its pretty much costfree to doim pretty sure this isnt what ccp intended and its really a gamebreaker not everyone wants to or should have to join an old and established corp because there is no alternative way of getting by in highsec save for staying in the noobiecorp foreverstarting a small new corp with a few friends early in the game should be an option without receiving multiple war decs week after week after week from pirates in hacs who like to shoot rifters while remaining safe themselevs it shouldnt be necessary to have inside connections so you can get into an alliancepersonally i think all these pirates should grow a set of balls and head into low sec but since its obviously not going to happen  i think the op has a point something should be done some ideas that have been tossed around in the past include more expensive wars depending on how high security you want it to be legal in for example you could issue an 07 war dec for 1 mil isk and leave the corp safe in 1008 systems or you could pay up the 50 million for a full war viable in 10 systems standing hits concord agreeing to look the other way doesnt mean an amarr is happy about having warship blowing ships up outside the emperors family academy while your sec status is fine and no armed forces will interfere  declaring high sec war will lower your empire standingstheres more im sure but these are some of those that hold merit for a very simple reasons frivolous and pointless highsec war has a steep cost the second example for example means that these wannabe pirates will have to either cut down on their warsm or work like dogs on missions to maintain a standing high enough to remain in the empire wars for a reason are still very possible and the damages can be undone its however no longer possible to repeatedly gank newbie corpsof course it would be a problem for the few legitimate honest to god real mercenaries out there but yeah something needs to changei like the way eve lets us mind our own business and take the war to the enemy when we need to however its abused more than its used properly its tragic and since we cant change people  maybe just maybe we need to slightly alter the rules of engagement
i agree with arna padrona and i trust ccp to handle the problem with finesse and maybe a little zaz  resaec fitsuga
arnayour post was ok up until you were telling others to grow a set of balls and go to low sec whilst sitting in your high sec bunker that kind of crap right there leads to more war decs than most i do believetopici am not a big fan of flagging and unfortunately this seems to where this leading to i do agree that there are some corps that seem to pick on the weak because they do not want to lose and or padding there epeen kd ratio is their end game this needs to be looked at on how to curb this however i would not like to see the option to kick a little corps ass because he is being a smack tard and deserves a whoopin you need to put in place a reason for these guys to go after a fatter target nerf batting the problem never really solves the problem i think by creating incentives you will see less of the griefing you will never see the end of it because you will have players always saying they are being griefed no matter how old they areit can be done by establishing some incentivepenalty to take on other corpsalliances establish corp standings the higher the standing the better the benefits cheaper office rentals alliance fees corp fees taxes repair fees war dec fees etc i figure you guys might come up with other thingscorp standings can be affected by the corp age size assets and who you war dec so a warring corp will be more apt to attack a larger corp with an equal or higher standing to lower your status by attacking n00b corps the corp will find it self paying higher fees as in higher war dec fees have a war chest 01 to 05 tax per month of the value of the corp gives an incentive to go after fat loot so older corps will have higher ratings and fatter lot so if a corp does not grow beyond 5 guys its corp standings still grow due to age of the corp and the war chest grows and making it a viable target giving the players time to get settled and experienced to fight back having a negative corp standing increases the taxes to this chest making them a viable target also so now you can have corps go after larger corps with a fat war chest instead of trying pound the little dude because all you would get from the little dude is probably a couple million isk and a negative rating and your fees just went up if they want to get their status up they need to do it by war deccing a corp with higher standings increasing the size of there corp etcanother words if you have a small corp with minimal assets personnel creation date of the corp and etc give them a status rating as the corp grows and ages the standing raises so even if they do try to keep it small to avoid such decs there corp sanding still raises as time goes on the lower the standing the more folks would look at you as just pathetic ginger when he had october snow could have had a really high standing with a 10 personal sec status sec status and corp standings would be two different things you could be the nastiest son of a beached whale in eve but your standings would be respectable and identify that pirate corp as one to be respected this does have a rp edge to this i admit and it does unfortunately scream mah ehonor which sucks but i do not know any other way out side the impending doom of the nerf bat and destroying good eve game play
ill just throw this out therei think a more reasonable and workable proposition would be for any implementation of allianceowned gate guns in 00 to be more analogous to low sec gate guns their function being to maintain law and order more than being automated weapons of war such that they only fire on pilots who are criminally flagged against the owning alliance and their firepower is similar to low sec gate gunsthat way anyone entering into combat with the territorial alliance in their space is subject to suppressing fire from all their gate guns i just dont think youll find sufficient support for poslevel fully automated guns at stargates
as ever the details will almost inevitably need a lot of work but the broad strokes here are good and the fact that we have a goon and a star fraction working together to make a mutually agreeable plan for 00 sovereignty changes is just dumbfounding whats next mccain and obama picking each other as vp
were definitely finding the concepts people like and pinpointing the ones people dont like fahtims jita park thread was a great way to get more ideas out without having to debate a particular proposal in its entirety im glad that we highlighted that security sovereignty and logistics are distinct concepts and that a given system could have any combination of those three established to different extents for instance that an alliance might lay sovereign claim to a system but have poor security or that an alliance might establish firm sovereignty and security without necessarily establshing industrial logisticsi think these are good starting principles that allow for a lot more variety in terms of what a given piece of territory might look like in contrast to the current system where sovereignty security and logistics are all the same thing based solely on how many pos are set up in system
im still working back at the other threadthe big strengths i like of this system are1 sovereignty and economicslogistics separation2 lowers the potential amount of sov objectives in a system to a smaller more consistent value planetsnot entirely satisfied on capability to distribute fleet fights across multiple gridswill keep shuffling around concepts over on the other thread to keep progressing towards a comprehensive solution
the hacking module current shows its worth in opening cans amongst other delights no not amazing i would propose that hacking should be useful for pvp  eg the ability to hack and disable offline a module on an enemy ship with skills to specialise in hacking certain modules
i liked this one more than the specialist ammo  that ones off the wall
i like your crazy ideas
i had another thought about this  it will give ship scanners more of a role in pvp  so you can choose what module to target for hacking this would be very useful in breaking away from a strong pirate ship  eg disable their warp disruptoror imagine disabling a repper on a dreadnought theres a lot of potential there
didnt think of hacking warp disruptors that would need some careful balancing because else everyone would just fit a hacking module instead of some wcs
possibly but then we must be aware that hacking is chance based it really depends on the situation in a gang they may go for tanking mods remote repairers injectors etc in a 1v1 they might go for the guns or reppers themselves  id imagine amarrians going for the white noise or the em active hardeners
i disapprove its a thing that just sounds cool but whould just be another pain in the butt for ppl that actually pvp another to complex idea to implementwhat should be able to do though is to hack secure containers and being able to can flip them
youre right i should really try pvp out
this idea gets my full supportlol 00 hacking mod on all ship titan comes in hack its dd noaz lol sounds fun 
sounds like the terran enforcer from ebtes were my favorite class even though hacking was broken in that game id love to see hacking in this game being able offline modules would be best suited to some of the ewar ships make a 2nd class of electronic attack frigs that get bonuses to hacking so they can offline random modules nothing like being in the middle of a fight and being able to disable your enemys local reps
hacking in pvpi like
in laggy situations this would be god awfull for bothsides this is already in eve anyway its called lag and it prevents all your mods from going online low med and hi slots
how is that relevant to what is being proposed thought doesnt that apply to everything anyway
adding more complications much like what ew does anyway but worse makes the game overcomplicated you want to disable someone nuet them ew them why add a layer that does not need to be there and just adds complications to a fleet battle in which we are meant to be making less laggy rather than more so
this indeed has potential but it will need to be implemented with great care lest you want yet another 9000 whine postssigned
cyber warfare for the winsignedwould love to be able to hack a titan and disable the doomsday device and jumpdrive
come to think of it it may be the only saving grace a titanless and cappoor entity has against one when engagednote hacking modules only operate at a range of 5km
i have seen emergency warp break one warp scram at 1 strength it will not warp under 2 i think this was more to allow a system where a ship in a mission that got disconnected can break the  01 not accurate strength of an npc scram shipi do supprot a change to the drone system if i move my laptop out of range of the router it disconnects if i move back in range it will reconnect when setup properly why cant drones reconnect once you are back within range of them
note within the context of a logoffski in a pvp engagement the scrambler will only have effect if it was engaged prior to the targets log off if the target logs off before the scrambler engages it will appear that the target is breaking the scramble during the emergency warp out and this will occur regardless of how strong the scramble isgood analogy on the reconnect issue aptly put why cant the drones reconnect when you get back in range of them damn good questionregardswindjammer
i have listed below a few ideas i have regarding specialist ammunitiontargetpainting ammunition seriously i am surprised that none of the scientists of the 4 empires havent introduced these things when a round of such ammunition hits a target it increases the signature radius by 50 for a short period of time 10 seconds each round stacks effect halves with each additional round the round does less damage than an equivalent t1 round very useful against small shipsheavy kinetic ammunition this type of ammunition has a very high mass also increased volume etc the purpose of this kind of ammunition is to physically push the target ship acts as a bumping agent for stubborn ships on undock points or if used on medium to small ships can push them out of warp scramblingdisruptingwebbing range or bump a ship in orbit to favourably change transversal slows down the ship using them when loaded energy transmitted to additional counterthrusterscircuitry disrupting ammunition little nanites can be gremlins in the works lowers sensor strength of target ship transient but does no damage
not sure if i support my own ideas but hey
despite having the same velocity as regular cruise missiles fof cruise will not hit agressed targets beyond 79km standard cruise will hit with a raven out to at least lock range with a sensor booster for example i get my fleet setup scorp you can use raven scorp pretty much any cruise missile boat with a sensor booster and range script have a buddy go out to 90k and aggress you missiles guns ecm anything despite having the velocity to fly that far youll get the message arbalest cruise missile launcher has no valid targets in range or something to that effectim putting this here because its been bugreported attached to a defect etc but not fixed not just a sensor booster issue because it doesnt work up to the base lock ranges of some missile boats even without a sensor boosterfix it
youre right i didnt think you could move to the next step without completing something in the previous step thanks for clearing it up
ok so a warp disruptor has one point and cannot turn off a ships microwarpdrive a warp scrambler has 2 points and turns off a microwarpdrive so shouldnt something with infinite points turn it off as well or fry it p obviously this would only work in focused mode but i think its stupid that dictors cannot disable mwds
if you cant be happy with your 30km infinitypoint scram and aoeability and the ability to lock down supercaps then train for gallente recons
removing learning skills is a fail idea in my opinion its all part of the game balance would you also suggest that cccp do away with attribute implants i believe attribute points help balance the game not every character should have the same because each character is created with a different purpose in mind
i too am concerned that jade is the csm member with the largest amount of issues on this list why is this are there no other csm members that have issues to bring up that are supported by the players
jade is the most liberal about seeing topics he likes and bringing them forward others tend to only bring up issues they feel strongly about i wish that more would be brought forward because theres too many good topics that just sink without being noticed but i dont think that the csm wants to spend twice as much time on meetings in order to bring forward everything or that ccp would thank them if they did
im not an expert on computer networking but i thought there was a fairly fundamental difference between bigger packets and more packets when it came to lagginessfor lack of a better word making a packet bigger doesnt hurt too much  bandwidth is not an issue for people on highspeed internet given that its apparently possible to play eve on dialup  but sending out more packets is worse also isnt most of the problem the code base anyways other games can handle 600 people in a room no problem but the biggest server in gaming craps itself in fear ccp was a garage operation when eve launched forced into quick and dirty and its been reaming us ever since its better than not having the game of course but thats the real genesis of a lot of these problems to my understanding
im kinda late to the party here but theres a bunch of good ideas here i had a system half written that was not a million miles away planets need a lot of love under the current game mechanics they should be the most important bodies in the sovereignty system and not just an empty warp point this sounds good and restores the status of planets something id really like is for the final stage of occupying a planet to involve flying in troop transporters and deploying troops to capture the bunker located on the surface troop transports would be a new shiptype a t2 hauler is the most obvious route to go with this although if anyone has other suggestions id be interested to hear them with a siege mode required to deploy dropships for added fun the defenders would be able to smartbomb the dropships as they flew to the bunker in particular on the economic side id like to see the development of planetary industries which would take the place of the current empireseeded pos consumables and at higher sovereignty levels the introduction of npc logistics which would haul these consumables to the holding alliances control towers these haulers would also be a viable small gang target for hostiles rolling through your space cultural structures is something id never really thought of are you envisioning a sort of rometotal war and probably a million other games which i havent played too system where your populations have a loyalty rating depending on your governance with the potential to disrupt your economic and military structures or even revolt if you dont keep them happy oh wow please make this happen im getting great mental images of a covops sneaking around the system with a cargohold full of spies and saboteurs delivering them to the various structuresas a final point its worth pointing out that not all planets would be inhabited or even inhabitable and so planetary population isnt something that should apply to jupitertype gas giants or scorched mercurylike rocks having some systems virtually or even completely deserted and some with a heavy population might be an interesting development to distinguish systems from each other more
no im talking about server side bandwidth load it scales exponentially with the number of ships receiving updates about each others actions nbody problem quadrupling the resources available will only double the maximum limit headroom will get harder and harder to come by unless something is done
i like scatims ideas about npc lootim a little skittish about putting too much work into npc civilizations on the planets considering this game is designed to be like a giant sandbox and there are like 100k players living in highsec who can be moved to 00 to establish 00 civilization more infrastructure for ruling the serfs is a better solution i thinkmaybe combine the two to an extentim chewing on some ideas i think everyone will like in the meantime will see what happens with the assembly thread and see what kind of feedback its gettinggoing to be busy for the next few days but will try to keep contributing
my thoughts on why the large sovchanging battles need to be across multiple grids have gotten a little clearerproblemsthe timezone balancing system stront timers has the benefit of telling us when and where the showdown will occur the two specific sideeffects arethe skill of pilots and level of coordination and commander quality is greatly diluted as lag kicks inlopsided fleet battle is hopeless but the pos system works to ensure that sov changing battles are fleet battles thus if alliance numbers are hopeless and the enemy is committed no level of skill and cunning can allow twenty pilots to levy their toll upon the enemymoar should be better less should be less but the way it is now with fleet battles guaranteed after the stront timer runs out less is nothing and moar is everything im exaggerating of course but its obvious that large fleet battles nullify the efforts of significantly outnumbered pilotsgoalstimezone balancing is intact but the field of battle is not a single objective its a series of simultaneous objectives that fall within the stront timer system all objectives have significance to the fight thus forcing an attacker to divide forcesbut if we divide forces then the defender can just curbstomp our divided detachment yes this is why it would be necessary in this system to commit forces very carefully and try to keep the upper hand while playing as few cards as possible this is what every great tactical victory in history has been based on shaping the outcome so that a little application of an unadvertised reserve will turn the tide completelymultigrid battle will also have the effect of vastly increasing the importance of mobility and influence optimal ship distributions downward towards cruiser and bc hulls pinning an opponent with support will mean not only can they not get away but that they cant redeploy to go aid forces under attackmultigrid combat brokered by the stronttimer system will be the most healthy thing in the development of eve
the gate guns idea worries me a little lowsec gate guns have the unfortunate effect of restricting gatecamp composition to only those ships able to permatank them and i wouldnt like to see the same limitations become a factor in 00 warfare  interceptors or dictors should be able to roam solo or in small groups and camp gates for careless residents without being vapourised by autodefences the second they aggro a defenderthe gate fortifications idea is worth sticking with though so maybe some sort of gate defences other than guns ewar or perhaps even remote reps
poss are gay how come 00 powers have no cool structures compared to empire why is our sov system so boring and our capability to build player empires so limitedproposal for the sovholding planetary defense platformsplanetary defense platform is a large structure with antistructure way way way bigger than dread firepower artillery for enforcing sovereignty the ability to build an empireesque array of other structures at that planet up to two can be built theyre separated in stable orbits with the planet in the way so that they never actually see each other if one is built at an enemy planet it will start wiping out all the poss and other structures in orbit with the exception of other defense platforms yay death stars if you win sov or contest sov at a planet say byebye to that planets possthe structures are built in light of the fact that they wont survive the largest assaults and are designed instead to attempt to disperse attacking and defending forces interests to allow more room for tactical maneuvering and function as a more robust tool of sovmodulation arrays dusing quantum entanglement power transfer sensor array triangulation and gravitational tide harvesting it was made possible for an assistance structure to have a direct relationship with the main structure and to bolster its defenses the added vulnerability of the satellite structures is seen as a tradeoff whereby vulnerability to small threats is the price paid to force the distribution of large threats the ones that a defensive structure is required to help cope withpdp modulation array benefits50 bonus to shield resists the defensive systems of the platform work with the sensors of array to identify sources of incoming fire and modulate the shield to cope with them this boosts hp and shield recharge at the same time25 bonus to power grid extra guns at the main platform will come onlinearray interactionafter looking at the goals of what fahtim put into the loworbit structures ive decided to investigate subsystems theyre very good force multipliers and also a very immersive game mechanicarray subsystems are subtargets that have less hp than the array and are much much smaller representing the keyhole that a weapon must hit to penetrate defenses at a surgical levelsubsystems are below the targeting capability of all caps even triaging carriers industrial repairs cant be done on surgical damageto make damage seem logical weapons hit for full damage regardless of how much gets through the keyhole perform damage calculations twice once for the array once for the subsystem subtract the subsystem from the array amount and apply that to the array as a whole the subsystem has its own hplogistics cruisers and sbs are the new sexy in array warfare sbs for having huge dps in tiny sig radius weapons and capability to dish it from afar logistics for having inordinately hugelogistics capabilitiesgoing to keep working on this whats our method of exposing empires to gang warfare at the moment
so where was star fraction anyway
i would like to bring up a topic that im sure will spark some firery replies but i think with faction warfare in game it needs to be brought up i would like to make a suggestion that ccp change the mechanics in low sec to be more fleet oriented at current in game a low sec status player in 04 or lower system who is in a fleet can be aggressed on a gate or station by anybody who chooses to do so nothing wrong with that meanwhile his fleet members who could support him and turn the fight to be in thier favor with support ships like recons and hacs and who would do so out of sentry range cantt unless they are in a ship that can handle the sentries something wrong with that basically what im saying is that game mechanics should be modified so that if you aggress someone no matter thier sec status you will also have aggression to thier fleet members also ccp should revisit remote repping mechanics for fleets with low secstatus players if low security players are in a fleet together and are assisting a low secstatus fleet member who doesnt have active gcc then gcc should not be assigned to anybody for aiding thier fleet member i would say there should be limitations to this  gcc should nulify a fleets ability to assist a member unless the fleetmates want gcc themselves any player with active gcc should be able to be engaged by anyone else without the aggressor having to worry about taking aggression from that persons fleet  aggression rights should only be given to players who are in a fleet with the aggressed player at the time of aggression you would not be able to join a fleet after aggression has occurred and get rights to attack someone with faction warfare in game it has become somewhat unbalanced for pirates in lowsec faction warfare has turned into antipirate blobbing often times i see 1530 man gangs made up of mainly interceptors t1 frigates t1t2 cruisers and mind you most of them are poorly fit they will be able to blob a low sec status player in a battleship who is in a fleet with support ships and kill that players battleship while his fleetmates can do nothing to help unless they are engaged or decide to take sentries in a recon or hac in recent patches ccp has encouraged fleet work however with current game mechanics fleet work is difficult if you are below 4999 i think adjusting this mechanic would balance out the antipirating being done by the factional warfare players and other groups after all eve is always striving for balance topic modified for easier reading
ccp will nerf what they want to nerf regardless of player feedback it is just the way it isi happen to agree with these changesthis is by no means the only change that has had a few of the player base upset those old school players will remeber the change to missles and the addition of a boat load of skills that still dont boost them back to prenerf dronesyep been nerfed toocarriersbeen nerfed toodont complaintest itprovide your feedback after testing and roll with the punches
eve development is not a democracy and thank insert deity here for that
i think the reason that they dont is fear that people will ignore the real server and choose to only play the test server if you can get 100 million sp a month on sisi some people will abandon the slow grind of tq in favour of the instant gratification of sisi that said i dont think that fear is especially justified  how many people get a game and then never turn off the cheat codes sure youll play around with them but then you go back to something that actually involves accomplishment also in a similar vein research and construction time on sisi should be lowered dramatically
i cant believe no one has posted an issue on this before its been proposed for years
one problem with sisi is that many times with new features the only people who can test them are those who will directly benefit and so have little reason to point out things which are brokenly overpowered way back when uo had a test server when you logged in you were given massive piles of money resources etc sisi currently comes close with the 100isk items but a lot of stuff is missing more importantly you had the ability to set your skills to anything you liked this let people test changes that would otherwise be untestable it lets people test things they would never actually use more people testing is always better
even if this were to occur it would be a case of good riddance to bad rubbish itd get rid of a certain element on the tranquility server and leave it to more serious players those searching for the easy button get a place more to their liking and get out of the hair partially of those who dislike easy buttons whichever server is used ccp gets paidgood proposal if for no other reason than to make testing work as testing should work id go even further and say all skills should be maxed for everyone on sisi or better yet allow everyone on sisi to choose the level of their skills give everyone a chance to test everything and anything upsides galore and not one single downside that i can seebest regardswindjammeredit i just noticed i appear to be agreeing with a member of goonfleet innominate the shame of it all but hes right
this is a great idea either let us train skills in a few minutes rather than days or just let us set the level of our skills

check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going onfor this one yes
this if the fitting templates were just stored client side this would be nothing more than an automation of dragging each module to its intended slot no extra work for the server and as a bonus corpalliance mates could send ship setups to each other as easily as sending eve mail
the reason why i suggested ccp would complain about server load is that it was their response to my change all ammo at once thread that the csm brought forward ccps response was essentially in part if we make ammoswitching easier people will do it more often since ammo switching is a database operation and database operations bugger up our server wed like to make the ui for switching ammo difficult to dissuade people from doing it i dont find that a particularly good rationale but its the one they used i could see them making a similar argument as regards any automated method of doing a large number of database operations is all im saying

i finally remembered the main reason we limited mercenaries from entering the war on the side of the agressorcorp a declares war on corp bcorp a is actually part of a group of griefer corps issues merc contracts for this war with 0 fees allied griefer corps accept and voila free warsit would open up a whole can of worms for corporations to gain free wars easily on targets of their choosing
then make the joiners pay wardec fees
i know what most of the forum types are flying so its a vain attempt but hey
but you dont live in 00 and you sure have a lot to say about the issue you obviously think the way you play the game is the best way what with calling everyone who doesnt live in npc 00 carebears riiight get an alliance together and come take some space it should be easy for such a great low sec pvper
seeing the recent reaction to the 1 agent can dish out 100 billion day thread it seem exactly what people in 00 want i dont see why someone should negate that wish
this is terrible do you have any 00 experience at allwhy should an alliance pay for things its members should be doing to begin with this is not a way to determine how much a player has been contributing to an alliance at all
hey how about instead of this boring pve  ccp just reintroduced 00 static deadspace plexes so 00 residents would have something to fight over instead of practically instanced pve  that nobody wantsyou know  that actually demands that you interactfight other people over resources
im with iti think the idea of hiring the agents makes the most sense from a lol rp standpoint and that it would give the awarding entity some control over standings it should however be limited to opposing factions of the rat types in the area for example in detorid you could only hire agents from factions opposing angel cartel esoteria opposing sanshas and so on
because we fought hard and poured a ton of work into taking it and maintaining it while you just move in and out on your own volition
could you elaborate on this please why wouldnt command issue a mission to siege a pos and watch the players organize themselves to do it and what do you believe to be the fundemental problems of 00 and do you have any lines of thought on how to fix themexactly noone would set up a mission to pay you for escorting your altdo they also offer you shiny isk for it thoughno i mean like a very very tiny pos no bigger than a habitat module and owned and looked after by a single individual playerthe real question is why do you do things for your alliance if they dont pay you for every drop of sweat after all the alliance makes money off your work through moon mining leasing out space to others and so on while you are squirming to get a few rats or roids to make your isk off and even that is probably taxed for some strange reason stealing even more of your hard work if you want to be an unpaid slave exploited to fill the commands coffers then youre just silly imo viva la revolution
this is where you need a little more insight to the nature of corps and alliances most people hook up with alliances of this nature because its a social part of the game social and game it is actually a lot of fun to be a part of that kind of thing and if a person does not like the fact that the corp heshe is in has to pay taxes to maintain and grow the corp to allow members other opportunities then there is always npc corps and can play by them selves if the members are there in the alliance and are fine with it then they will stay and contribute to help build and defend itit is alein to you beause its not your play style and you have never expereinced it
missions take away from the playerrun world rather than a real player giving missions eg your ceo and determining what is the most effective use your idea would have people running around trying to complete arbitrary objectives for no real reason
the short answer is because most 00 space is not profitable enough to maintain an empirescale infrastructure and warmachine while also paying rewards to the membership in the common case
even npc research slots charge you for the privilege and there are some corps around that offer pc research slots for significantly higher fees as wellbut with no waiting mercenaries charge for their services as should be obvious from the definition of the word mercenary and courier contracts tend to include a reward at least if people want their stuff to actually get moved so yes id have to say that those services already exist and that there is a functional shinyiskbased economy for them
of course most moon mining is done on an alliance level after the regular rank and file members have taken over new space we may not see the liquid isk from moon mining but that doesnt mean we dont reap the benefits aside from having all this space to use corps usually have reimbursement programs for ships lost on official ops so the hit isnt so hard not to mention how much isk it takes to keep the infrastructure up and running jump bridges online poss fueled bills paid all that comes from moon mining the real answer is most pilots dont fight for isk or moons we go after people we dont like to make them cry the space is just a bonus
actually just going bankrupt doesnt land you in prison going bankrupt is not a crime even though the people that foolishly invested in a poorly performing company and lost money might wrongly think oherwise defrauding shareholders lands you in prison one of the aspects of the enron scam that most people dont know is that many stock technicians traders that focus on the technical analysis of a stocks charts had gotten out of enron before the scandal broke why because although the price performance seemed inline with the fundamentals of the company it was completely backwards for the industry in general why because they were lying about the fundamentals all of the info that you should need to know for trading would ultimately be reflected in the price this probably would not happen overnight but would require greater development of a robust financial sector which would be the market movers that would cause the smart money moves presaging major price moves in other words if the financial corporations are dumping a companys stock in high volume and the price is tanking they may know something you dont and it is time to get outas always remember that buying stock is risky if you read enough books on rl stock trading you may be surprised at how pvp the attitudes of the authors are if you buy foolishly someone is not simply going to try to take your money they will take your money and that is perfectly legal stupidity costs moneythanks all who approve of the stock item ideathey like me they really like me
so after my last post i tried to think of a way to scam my stock proposal and how the market would correct that or if necessary what regulations would be required i guess the most obvious way would be to start a new corp make an ipo and then go bankrupt disappering with the isk this is essentially what happened during the dot com bubble and subsequent crash except that most of those werent exactly scams this has an easy market solution which was revealed during that crash dont buy stock from unproven companies with no profit history or business plan if you buy stock from a 1 day old corp with a 1 day old ceo you deserve to part with your money see comment on stupidity above this kind of scam would seem to be difficult to police but it is so obvious that only huge suckers should be taken in by it of course it would be bad to place time limit regulations on ipos because i can think of valid reasons for a brand new corp to have an ipo someone who has a history of profitable business starting up a new corp or a spinoff corp of course you wouldnt have to trust that person you would see the market movers in the financial sector smart money trusting himher with major volume and that should be enough validation at least for a short to medium timeframesince i am terrible at thinking like a crook what other ways of scamming the stock market are there
no supportthis thread is here simply because some goons want more people fit for missions out in low sec so they the goons can gain a no risk activity of their own namely ganking missioners with impunity just be honest and admit the reason your for this idea goon beyond that this would wreck a legitimate gaming style that exists in game just because somebody else doesnt like how they playeveryone claims that the riskreward is out of balance in high sec this may or may not be true personally i think its not out of balance but many would disagree but what most people fail to realise is that one of the main reasons high sec is there is for people to build up capital for lowno sec operations either to start them continue them or try them again because things didnt go so wellheavy pvpers think that moving levels 4s and other levels out to lowno sec will give them more easy targets to shoot at in reality in the long run it will have the exact opposite effect there will be even less for you to shoot at out in lowno sec because people will have to spend more time in empire running lower level missions in relative saftey before they have enough capital to venture outfarmers and isk sellers are a problem yes level 4 missions are a primary source of their income but this is a problem for ccp enforcement not an excuse to ruin a portion of the game for a goodly number of peopleonce again emphatic nonsupport
i also disagree with this proposal but i have to ask how does one farm in a l4 mission you need to have a ship capable of handling what comes your way and you need to talk to your agent and then make sure you are properly fitted for the type of mob you are facing either with shield harderners or armor harderners and such is someone that spend all day doing l4 missions a farmer or are they just playing the part of the game they find enjoyingi spend most of my time online hauling ore or doing market runs does that makes me a farmer or does that makes me a player that enjoys those aspect of the game
you dont need so much attention to do missioning passive tanks and fof missiles helps even better so a farmer a guy has several accounts and does missions with all of them all day long 237 all characters are in npc corps so you cant do anything about them as suicide ganking is not profitable on them and also the loss of ship for them is not expensive i know a guy talked a few times with him who does missions with 9 accounts all of them are played at the same time by himthe player who playes eve only for missions is called carebear no you are not a farmer because you use your brain what to buy what to sell and also you are operating in limited way of earning money missions lvl4 hisec are unlimited riskless way to earn money so thats why majority of eve players want to nerf them
simple and effective
not supportedof course all pvpers want to solve their problem of not having enough easy kills as income by forcing carebears into lowsec of course they market their solution as a riskreward thing of course its no real solution to relevant problems how many more anticarebear threads do we need on this forum seriously people havent we read this already over and over again with all the usual suspects stating the same things only looking out for their own interests instead of making a real effort to fix a real problem that benefits all in game
well good for you have a cookiehow much you can do is irrelevent there are players that pull in a billion or more per week that can afford to replace 5 implants all the time they are irrelevent tooim talking about the low end casual players who might pull in 2030m per month
i find it amusing that pvpers would rather fight carebears than other pvpers seems you dont think highly of yourselves at all
where the heck do you get this majority bull from
no support sylthi has the right of this high sec is a place for people to recover from losses in low sec00 and get moving again or just to enjoy a more casual approach to eve lets face it eve hardcores arent going anywhere whats the alternative what are you going to go play ccp obviously is very interested in growing the player base and many players simply arent going to want to compete right off the bat in 00 or maybe ever and why should they have to but enough will to keep the population growingthink of high sec as a fallow field its where new warm bodies arrive and get situated its where the beaten and tired go to rest sure some people will exploit the situation but the real money is still out in 00 if it wasnt why would anybody be there as it is ccps ambulation project and the presentation around it clearly shows the thinking of the team they want new blood new kinds of players maybe players that have interests other than 247 pewpewi remember leaving pirates of the burning sea because there was too much pvp all the time everywhere no real safe havens to recover or recoup all harbors could fall under blockade and the waters turn treacherous economies easily crushed but the defeated had nowhere to go to rebuild and recoverthats really when the genius of eves high sec hit me
people say this and that about how its for people to build up isk to go to low sec or 00 but the fact is in most 00 you would be making more money with a high sec agent i really dont care about killing the mission runners i just want the effort that it takes to be in low sec or 00 to be worth more than running high sec missions in a raven thats total lose would take 12 missions to pay off i would be just as fine if they dropped the rewards of high sec mission running down 50 then it would not bother me as much but having been living in 00 for 25 years i think i have a right to  that it is worth this much i have watched a friend on his high sec mission character and seen how much effort it takes that is why i think this is important
yes i read that drones thread to although this does seem like a similar situation its not exactly the sameif you disconnect with your drones out there is a chance for recovery you will be warped back and the drones are still therein this case the probes are completely lost there is no way to recover them you can see them you can fly up to them they are an object like a drone but you cant scoop themso on disconnect the lost is guaranteed with drones the ability to recover them or some of them even in a damaged state is still thereedit supported my own thread at notification of others 
good proposal like herschel yamamoto said same as on the drones emergency warp thread 
its the same principle in any case the details differ but the principle of a disconnect shouldnt result in you losing control of your stuff is the same in both cases also seriously support your own thread p
snecnes herschel means you should check the little box support this topic located just above your character selection box during a replywindjammer
sounds like a real issue and easy enough to fix so supported im not sure how often this really happens and as such how much priority it should have
signed  just make the probes be connected to the ship that launched them rather than the client session id
just been hit by this with a disconnect whilst having quest survey probes in flight how  annoying
i have had this happen a few times nothing more annoying than a random disconnect after 3040 minutes of quest probes out in a big ass system which basically means a completely wasted 3040 minutes of spamming that awesome interactive analyze button supported
dont let the low post count fool you tech lab is quality over quantity keep it
caod changes need to be clarified at the very least
agreed
i see a dev blog about forum updates and i start into my happy danceonly to find out that theyre not actually doing bugger all rewriting descriptions is nice and all but its not a forum change its a bit of descriptive text thats not worth a dev blog  if youre feeling really ambitious you might mention it in a thread on eve general we want actual forum changes at the code level not a modification of the descriptor text also please dont make caod an incharacter forum i like the tards having their own little fencedoff area and i dont want them invading the stillsometimessane forums also one other question i have  will any old threads be deleted im an archivist at heart and i hope all the threads from deleted boards will be moved to whatever remaining board seems most appropriate
i agreeid also suggest to them that there are many open source aspnet forum software libraries out there mind you that would mean they need to bring the entire website into the modern age  iirc they are still using old asp
agreed the forum doesnt need a reshuffle it needs a complete redesign from ground level upwardsgiven that all posters on here are tied to an in game character a pm system as requested above should be easy to implement just allow us to access the evemail system from the forum bar trial account characters from using the evemail system from the forum to avoid isk spamming as a cspa charge cant apply for messages sent from the forum only for messages sent ingame
i agree first and foremost that removing techlab is an issue
eve tech lab is the essential resource for all of us 3rd party developers judging the importance of a forum only by its post count this is what seemed to have happened is a too simplified means to make a proper decision two points1 due to the nature of that forums contents the potential userposter base is of course way lower than caod or md for example2 hint hint developers posting there might actually know how to operate a search engine evesearch google whatever and do so before posting the umpteens duplicate question about the same topicboth leads to a low post countwe might see something newa replacement for eve tech lab for 3rd party developers with the upcoming evelopedia which hopefully also provides a real useful official api documentation but if thats the case stating so in the dev blog would have saved much of the rabble going on now
tech lab must stay though id like it if there would be a thread or system that could keep track of available tools rather than having to dig through pages of topics to find what is interesting
ccp what about doing something usefull like upgrade the akwardness of the web code and feature wise ffs we dont even have a proper search function any php forum has
wow if thats true then why doesnt anyone use that to smuggle boosters
they were born as slaves let them die as slavesjkthis is a cool idea ie being able to turn useless commodities into something of use militants anyonebut this idea is so good that ccp will never use it stillsupport
should be a simple thing thing to do if it gets worked out using a lp store optionthough i think the problem lies in transportation to said stores and as such an option to convert slaves to free slaves in mid flight is much more desirable this of course is far more difficult to implement as is far down the line if at all
you know the theology council keeps sending me on missions that some minmatar fighters of freedom have captured some freed slaves it my job to kill the minmatar rebels and recover the freed slaves from their evil minmatar captorsalthough i do my job to recover these freed slaves i am a true amarrian whatever they did to earn their freed status is not for me to know however they should offer themselves up to my service if i choose by turning them into my personal staff if i choose toso i would support the option if i was able to take freed slaves and turn them back into slaves
no idea never used them carried them or stored them but i have carried and stored slaves and only had a faction hit when i have been scanned down and caught with them in my hold jumping between systems never for keeping them on ice in my station hangar and as this is about slaves rather than boosters shrug
its sad this is not an option already
correct afaikalso on the not doubling thing  i dont have an issue with multiple uses of the same rigs  you do have more than one engine your ship oh and posting with an alt to give it another thumb
what to say  greatsigned
supported plenty of things in the game have gone from useless to useful without verging on the overpowered  damage controls inertial stabs shield relays all the unused rigs should get the same treatment
i dont agree with everything you said but rigs definetly need a review especially the penalties or lack therof for the rigs
was browsing chatsubo today and found this link what were the results of this discussion will there be some pf about the third racesrecent returnee here and former royal knight of khanid i wrote some correspondence that reflected the rather pragmatic nationalistic view of the cyberknight faction as i saw it a couple years ago for the library here also had some good discussions with the cosmopolite and ardor over at chatsubo as well discussing some of the as yet inexplicable contradictions in the culture described for the mainline khanid and that for the amarrianscommon use of cybernetics among the khanid when access to cybernetics is jealously guarded by amarrian nobilitypriesthoodsa religious zealot faction seen as odd by ordinary khanid leading one to assume most khanid arent particularly dogmatic or even orthodox especially considering the question of how their own king flew in the face of amarrian tradition to lead themless xenophobic than mainline amarr which lead to the technological and trade ties with the caldari stateim kind of curious how all this fits together ive certainly had to cobble together zans own views so that i could even rp him he played a rather vocal part in the khanid carrier incident a while back and set him up as as best i could tell a stereotypical cyberknight since it seemed few others were rped that waymistrustful of the empire wary of reunification proud of his kingdoms as personified in the king deeds and successes more open to other races and ideas especially caldari but also holding to a code of honorwhat was hardest for me though was figuring out what kind of religious views he might have clearly the khanid cant cleave to amarrian orthodoxy their own king just left the trials and did his own thing on the other hand they did shelter some of the most radical and fanatic fundamentalists for a long while and do have their own zealot factionthe other question for me is the political stance of the kingdom the kings a pretty wise fellow to keep a low profile and let the other empires burn out fighting each other but you have to imagine there are political fault lines forming up now unionists want to aid amarr cyberknights are probably more in the caldari camp
was on the agenda 2 weeks ago but the meeting had to finish before it was addressed i moved it to the agenda for the coming meeting on sunday and it will get raised there
thank you ms constantine
i use drones as my main dps in level iv missions and these bugs happen to me all the time
seen both
i believe that any overhaul of moonmining must include opening up moon mining in 05 and 06  as i understand this was a feature of the game a few years back but was removed as part of the now failed program to force people into 00 space with dyspo and the other top 3 moons netting the uberallainces billions of isk a month per moon where is the major harm in allowing the small research corps using the crappy moonmaterials in hisec to help offset the cost of their poss
100 supported i think instead of respawning a terraforming element could be introduced where if you had the skills you could reseed the moon with x chance of certain mineral veins being recreated now i dont know much about terraforming so i might just be talking out my behind but it was a thought that popped into my head as i read the op
long thread is long
i like the general idea of making it randomized but it is pretty rough and serenity has some good points also open up moon mining in 4 at least currently it is 3 or below right while it needs some serious refinement and consideration it gets my support
to minimize the macroeconomic disruption caused by any change like this the total number of highvalue moons should increase to compensate for the flux time after a highvalue moon has vanished and before it has been rediscovered and minedif this is not done then the quantity of highvalue moon minerals on the market will decrease in proportion to the ratio of the average length of time that it takes to relocate a highvalue moon to the duration of the highvalue moondont try to spin this suggestion as wah dont take away my moonmining profits the income from highvalue moons is determined entirely by market demand right now the demand remains the same or grows regardless of what the supply does so the average of miners profits wont be affectedas an aside this would work out great for gs gs holds sooo much worthless space if the distribution of highvalue moons becomes more even across space over time it cant help but improve our space over the long run
good ideas also 1 for csm activity in the forum
a good idea but it would rise the price in t2 modulesships as the moons would assumably need to be rescanned re setup on each move perhaps the person who has the moon originally gets a heads up to its new location in an attempt to resecure if possiblealso the cost of scan probes would rocket even thought i own 3 medhigh moons i like this idea
not a bad idea though there would be several kinks that need to be worked onfor those saying that it would lead to less conflict i disagree once you set up a moon mining pos youre enemies are not going to want to let you have the income from that even if they cant hold the moon themselves so fast raiding parties hitting the moon miners to disrupt operations are always going to be a threatlikewise say alliance a and alliance b both manage to locate the same new deposit just inside alliance cs territory suddenly alliance cs territory becomes a battleground with 3 alliances fighting it out for control of the new resources all trying to push the other two alliances back far enough to be able to set up their own mining pos and defend itas a result the limits of alliance control become a lot more fluid with the borders shifting almost daily across the map
before they even consider this they need to make both moon scanning and pos setupteardown less pointlessly soul destroying
jade maybe you should just propose that ccp give you some 00 space and a bunch of money not really much point in trying to hide it with words
there has to be some static resources to differentiate one system from another
id love to see the rp explanation for a moon formed over millennia suddenly having a geological miracle occur and its entire mineral composition changing at randomi personally prefer the idea of moons remaining static because it better reflects the real world that we can all relate to  for example look at all those lucky arabs in saudi who have all the oil dysprosium whilst us poor sods in the uk only have coal atmospheric gasesits a fact of life that some regions of earth are richer in resources that are high in value than others and no matter how much we wish for it oil fields are not going to randomly up sticks and appear under a different country  i dont see why eves resource distribution should be any differenthowever that said  there is something that can realistically shift and change which is technological advancement  in the same way we are looking to achieve the same ends oil does for us with other things biofuels etc how about some kind of rp technological advancement which enables us to make synthetic dysprosium by mining chains of other materialsthis could be set up with a similar idea to invention and t2 bpo where a dyspro moonholder still has the best moon like a t2 bpo holder still has the best resource as he gets dyspro directly from his moon but other players can make synthetic dysprosium with a larger time  pos network investment and correspondingly smaller profit margin in exactly the same way you can build t2 gear but with more work and smaller profit than the bpo owner doesim not necessarily proposing that as an idea and i dont even know if id support it if someone else did but it would seem more realistic than minerals magically jumping off of one moon flying across space and landing on another one
permanent main deposits  depleting random minor deposits  stability without stagnationi have already posted a way to achieve this link further up this thread
actually the situation in the real world is closer to that analogy than you think while old fields get depleted new ones are being constantly located at the moment the primary barriers to extracting all the discovered oil reserves is politics and technology with most of the discovered reserves being in remote areas with unique problems associated with their extractionfor example britain has extracted a good amount of the oil from the north sea over the last 40 years there is still a huge amount in the ground still to be extracted however a large proportion of that oil is simply too difficult or uneconomical to extract with the old big oil company business models its why smaller companies are making a killing at the moment with the fields that the likes of shell and bp wont touch likewise a lot of oil is now being located on the west side of scotland in the atlantic ocean requiring innovations in deep water rigsso its less a case of the deposits magically moving and more a case of old deposits drying up and new deposits being discovered often in areas that the old survey equipment either couldnt reach couldnt process or simply missedthis is compounded in eve by the simple fact that each moon survey is completed within 10 minutes deposits being missed would therefore be easy to explain as errors in the original scans which only pick up the most obvious results in the scanned areaconversely as an idea you could come up with a structure that you could anchor survey sattelites once you had your moon mining pos up and running that would continually scan for fresh deposits on that moon thus prolonging the lifespan of the materials youre mining
those that have the really good moons have already won the race so to speakthey had to fight for them and now reap the rewards of milking them the problem with this model is that any newcomer alliance that wishes to challenge them needs those same moons in order to be able to keep up with a long campaign of attrition as long as old established alliances have iskfountains at their disposal they will only truly be challenged by other old establish alliancesby setting up the moons in the way they did ccp basically created player run factions not alliances in order to challenge the old guard one needs the resources to matchmake every moon mineral available in every moon in the game either in the same amounts or do some sort of breakdown with 50 of the moons containing the 1st 3rd 5th 7th rarest mins and the other 50 containing the 2nd 4th 6th 8th rarest mins however you do it break the monopoly under this system alliances will still have incentive to conquer more space because that will mean more moons in total but the bigger and ungainly they get the harder their logistics become so some alliances may want to pare down some of their space this makes it necessary to balance expansion with sustainment and the same group of 500 guys doesnt own one quarter of conquerable space anymorethink about it if you have a small lean welltrusted everybodyknowseverybodyinreallife alliance they will be able to take more space then an equal sized alliance that may not know each other similarly huge allinaces containing thousands of people will have to strive to make sure they can trust their pos managers if they want to hold on to all of their spaceafter a few months of this level of asspain required to hold massive chunks of space it will be interesting to see who still does i think it is totally realistic that some of the old guard will still prosper under this system hell some might even benefit from the new system but the old huge lazy alliances will surely crumble if they cant step up to the new challanges of maintaining their spacewhos with meedit about the break down of minerals in the everymineral moons have like 25k units of the most commingleast expensive min per 500 units of the middle minerals per 1 unit of the rare minerals or something like that not those numbers exactly but along those lines
cutting my own fingers by supporting this but hey didnt like static plexes dont like static moons maybe its worth training astrometrics v for this 
oh god this is dumb stop making proposals on 00 which you obviously have no idea abouthow about thislets have agents that you have improved your standings with just up and vanish lets have bpos just randomly vanish from your hangar and show up in my hangarthere is no facepalm big enough for this idea
and the old guard weighs ininteresting
aw it looks like somebody is mad as hell over the t2 bpo thread that toman madeit looks like somebody is terribly terribly afraid of losing their cash cow
which came first my reply in this thread or the whine thread about the bposgoonswarm forumwarrioring at its finest
make no mistake static moon mining is one of the few things that encourages combat in 00 at this point arguing anything else is delusional
what about some sort of system that encourages maintenance of conquered space it would make 00 more of a new frontier where new entities could compete rather than join bob goons ra or ncno doubt the 00 power blocs would absolutely hate this idea as it would burden them with having to work to keep what they have but how many people people not characters are actively in 00 and how many of all of those highsec carebare lowrisk highreward carebear pussies would go to 00 if it didnt mean having to join an old established alliance who by the grace of time alone got there first
i think the main reason why ccp hasnt made moon mining dynamic is because they know all too well that youll end up with more posesthink about it for a second the most logical way to overcome dynamic moons would be to have a large pos or two running the reactions and small moons mining the moon minerals at the dynamic moons no one is going to unanchor a large pos with all the the fixings to move to a new moon they are all going to have a central place to operate the fact jump freighters make it easier now to move minerals from pos to pos so logistics like issues are kind of a nonissue nowthis would lead to people not bothering with the 60 minutes unanchor time to recover a small amount of assets small pos moon miner silo people would probably leave the pos up anyway in case something good came along on that moon people would have to attack and kill the old powerless pos before they deploy their ownthe way ccp would combat this would be to make pos unanchor times a lot faster because you know they dont want thousands of small poses all over the placethis would in turn break 00 warfare the ability to quickly move a pos makes it easier to defend locationsalthough id support something to make moon mining not a static as it is i dont think dynamic or depleted resource are the solution
the reasons that new entities normally dont show up in 00 is that the majority of space in 00 is absolutely terrible and the small amount of good stuff is already defended
not supported1 moving poses is inhumane treatment of logistics personnel as it stands having to move every moon mining pos once every 3 months on top of the logistics nightmare is asking for people to simply quit the game outright2 as has been pointed out on the parody threads there are other forms of static income3 you being the one to propose such things is akin to a person claiming all people with blue eyes and brown hair 00 population should be locked in a cage pos setups and poked with sticks for your amusement its a sick sadistic sort of entertainment you probably come up with while sitting at home when you arent role playing a lady of the night for some well hung caldari stud4 over 23rds of your post is posturing with a sort of assumed setup for ad hominem towards anyone that would disagree would ccp be prepared to shake up politics and overstabilized borders in 00 anyone who doesnt support your form of torture is automatically assumed to be for over stabilized borders and not necessarily against your half witted ideas on things you yourself will never have to experience its akin to the whole abortion issue one side identifies as prochoice and the other prolife as if either is truly against freedom in choice or life itselfthis sort of writing should be an automatic put off if your argument cannot stand on its own 2 feet without such posturing it deserves to die a cold death if it stands only because people are too moronic to see through such posturing then it is deceptionsometimes i wonder who really wants to destroy this game jade constantine or goons you seem to be the most intent on destruction thus far
absolutely terrible because the few good moons that make it worth while are well defendedeven though the proposal jade put forth has a ton of problems on its own it still addresses the fact that there is a huge imbalance between those that have and those that want and there is little recourse for anyone other than another huge 00 power bloc to do anything about it its basically class war the aristocracy controls the wealth and the peasants revolt i think jade is just trying to come up with some way to make it possible to redistribute the wealth although his idea does suggest some sort of random reassigning rather than a way to make it so those not in power bloc may be able to even think about contesting for it
yes and this thread and everything associdated with jade constainte isnt ing stupid enough with this joke of the csm called the jade constinte power hour
jade stick to hardcore mode proposals
dumb idea jade alliances did the work they make the effort they control the space many of the locations of these moons are well known so get your fleet of puppets to try and take them overmoons are what they are and i find it hard to consider any of them one day magically changing into another im all for expanding the supply of rare moons but leave that to the devs and when they decide to expand eve it constantly has been expanding so when new systems come out new moons too
jade i went and checked the features and ideas discussion forum and i find no thread with many supporting replies is there a reason why this feature and idea wasnt posted there first to get feedback from the general eve populace
lol since when do people check with the features and ideas forum before posting their stuff in the assembly hall
not supportedthisyeswhati hate freedom there how goony is that goony goons goon goonedhmthis edit seems a little extreme but sadly it also looks accurateit used to be complexes now its dyspro t2 bpos are a bit less profitable due to invention but theyre still quite the isk printing machine and it still would be if this change were put in they might even improvegrim mercy one of the things about t2 bpos is that theres even more of a huge imbalance between those that have and those that want and there is little recourse for anyone other than another huge 00 power bloc to do anything about it except that not even a huge 00 power bloc can do anything about it the t2 bpos belong to those that got into the game early end of story unless they actually want to get rid of themi wouldnt have any problem with increasing the viability of mining lowends andor decreasing just how much the dyspro isk fountains are worth but it seems like the jades proposal is an attempt to nerf someone elses alliance level income while keeping his own intact
i actually support this  currently moon mining is too static and rich powerful alliances will always be rich and powerful due to the moons they control except in rare circumstances such as internal disputes or overwhelming offensice action
sorry dont buy thisrandom moons means people will bunker because eventually they will get a pimp moon this discorages pvp and invasionshowever the current system is broken in creating pos wars which are the most hated part of evesolutionexploration have miners able to gather these stuff from exploration belts or from mining planets or suns directly get rid of station npc style income promote active resource generation in risky space so pvpers can send small raiding gangs to hunt insted of superblobs to fight poss uner 20 titans doomsdaying under cynojammer crapegnow  pos goes up zero encoragement for raiderssmall pvpers only superblobers attack poss for their isk static resources  broken gameplaywhat should happen  perhaps people take out exhumer lvl5 ships or whatever to mineor gas collect 00 suns this is very risky since any pvper can enter system and warp to sun to guarentee a fight perhaps the miners get a mixture of 00 minerals such as dyso and prom to keep rp fans happy condensation for gas collectors either way  make moons mining no longer afk npc isk printer that requiers a superblob affair to remove by pomoting the poor eve member to mine sunsplanets to econimically compete with mining towers this promotes the poor eve member and helps him make the riches that previously only ceos who kept the moon isk had but also it promotes the solo pvper again and the small raiding gangwhat do you think
guys i have a huge pile t2 bpos lying here and invention kind of moved my profits from monster huge to just huge how can i move it back uphey lets make getting the materials for t2 ships even more difficult and expensive and even more of a logistical nightmare than it is currently i dont really know anything about 00 or how moon mining works but if we make the mats randomly disappear and pop up elsehwere that will slow down things enough we will be able to cash innow i just need more words 
aye
i can agree with most of this except for removing level 4s from highseci would support a dynamic agent quality system where each corp that offers missions has its agent quality adjusted based on use at downtime the server checks which agents were used most and adjusts qualities per corplevel lowsec missions would be balanced to average about 10 with the spread depending on use highsec missions would average 10 per corp
1 missions need to be made more dynamic and unpredictableagree 2 mission payout in lowsec and 00 needs improvementagree3 module loot has a negative impact on the economy by making t1 production obsolete and injecting too many minerals into the economyagree on removing nonmeta items only 4 missions in factional warfare require improvementsnot participating in fw so cant answer5 mining missions require improvementsagree6 agents are static resulting in overloaded mission hubs desire to have agent quality made dynamicagree on the payout per visits suggestion7 level 4 missions in their current form do not belong in highsecurity spacebasing mission payout on highlow00 sec fixes this8 standing is being monopolized by missions no ways to get standing outside of mission running with the exception of fw standingmanufacturing items or mining for standings springs to mind
1 missions need to be made more dynamic and unpredictableif this can be done in a logical way such as having a variable in missions im all for it running duo of death vs 40 frigates would completely destroy a lot of setups having a slight chance of t2 npcs in missions increasing the chance as the mission level goes up would make it tougher without destroying the missions2 mission payout in lowsec and 00 needs improvementthere have been many ideas for this so all i can say is that i agree one idea i had was to make people coming into your mission that arent a member of your corp or fleet automatically have the aggro timer while in the deadspace area this wouldnt change much except allowing the mission runners a firstfire opportunity and encouraging the pvp that many mission invaders crave3 module loot has a negative impact on the economy by making t1 production obsolete and injecting too many minerals into the economystrongly agree increase the bounties of the npcs and have them only drop meta items would make mining more profitable and would reopen the market to playermanufactured items basic t1 aside from drones i never even use any t1 items that i get from rats  its either sold as with smartbombs or reprocessed i dont have a problem with keeping drone loot the way it is though4 missions in factional warfare require improvementsi dont participate in fw so i have no clue about that5 mining missions require improvementsyes i completely agree the idea of no roidbelts in highsec could definitely tie in here as well as increasing the amount of time and ore available in a mining mission we need some of the ore in this belt the rest of it we dont care what you do with6 agents are static resulting in overloaded mission hubs desire to have agent quality made dynamicif this is implemented intelligently i have no problem with this agent qualities do help you know how much standing you need to take them but it does form mission hubs i guess this matches real life though as more people would travel to new york or chicago for the big npc rats than would head to west virginia or colorado7 level 4 missions in their current form do not belong in highsecurity spaceyou were right in what you said about this one the recent news article suggested that missionrunning involved the most players in this game and nerfing this would anger over 50 of the playerbase as the qen stated over 50 of people have no interest in pvp in this game8 standing is being monopolized by missions no ways to get standing outside of mission running with the exception of fw standingi had an idea for this one manufacturing and loot drops arent always sold what if they could be traded to fw companies even if the faction doesnt like you much for standing increases makes rp sense and gives another way of achieving faction standing the standing increase would have to be fairly minimal but if you ran missions for minmatar in amarr space you could give them the named loot drops in exchange for your evershrinking amarr standingone other item you forgot to add9 level 5 missions need improvementthe risk just doesnt match the reward in these missions since organized players ie player corps involve themselves in teamwork having the possibility of dropping capitallevel salvage might be a possibility here where the salvage from level 5 missions can be used in making rigs for capital ships in general the benefits need to be boosted here as well bounties lp reward etc
this idea is ok better than ccps at leaststill needs some tweaksthe activation time of the mwd would need to be decreasedif you get in range by using your mwd then u click it offwait 10secs your target has warped off or gone out of scramble rangebut the idea has some substance 
i like the idea more than what ccp had in mind but it doesnt solve two problems 1 ludicrously fast ships are still ludicrously fast i dont like it to see that most ships just horribly die if they jump into a gatecamp whereas the nanos could still jump in without needing to particularly worry about it thing is it doesnt matter how big the camp is a nano who isnt completly stupid will always escape this imbalance wouldnt be removed by sarmauls idea2 frigs can kite outside anyones webrange using afterburners this way except for some amarr pulse laser platforms they were extremely difficult to hit this is for assault ships especially with ab giving 300 instead of 150 faster assault ships like the minmatar ones would be tremendously better than slower ones especially the jaguar would kick ass while the vengeance or the harpy still were mediocre so youd be creating new imbalances with itbut tbh id love to see sarmauls idea coming to use lots of pilots would have to reconsider their approaches to combat and their fittings with the ab becoming useful in pvp it would create a whole new level of diversity id welcome this
i agree that any change that affects speed will require a lot of rebalancing over a wide range of ships but i want to address this point quicklywith the balancing of polycarbons and snakes the ultraextreme speeds will be moderated allowing fast ships to more easily move through gatecamps at the expense of their combat ability seems like a good tradeoff to me preserving the viability of guerrilla style warfare without allowing superfast ishtars to fly circles around most opponents

did you check your mails or the insurance panelinsurance would send you a mail that the ship isnt insured anymore but only if you open the insurance panelmaking it rather useless and obviously broken
have the server check during downtime which insurances have less than 24 hours on them and send out an email
i totally support this
totally support this sorry forget to hit support topic

you have some very wrong ideas about how things actually work in 00 for most playersin essence your proposal would make 00 very much harder for people who fly t1 ships and very little different to those who fly t2 you might want to think about which type of player would be hurt by this
incidentally if insurance in eve was in any way realistic it simply wouldnt exist at all for pod pilots as a demographic we rate as a worse risk than 15 year old male methaddicted demolition derby fans
if you want to make insurance realistic just have the company charge you 100m isk per month and never pay anything out
wouldnt any kind of insurance removal make eve more harsh so to speakgetting insurance can clearly only been seen as a carebear thing as it lessens the impact of losing a ship imagine how much more economical damage you would do to your opponents when repeatably destroying their ships while you being superior at pewpew on the other hand very rarely loses a ship and as such benefit greatly from better insurance
id support a complete removal of insurance but not one designed to make highsec even more profitable and 00 even more worthless even that would be a huge nerf to anyone living in 00 probably putting the profitability far below high sec
visiting is not the same as living there in an alliance participating in alliance warfare his example of the cynojammed system is perfectly valid in this discussion no matter how much you wish to marginalize the differences between empire and 00 gameplay your proposed changes affects everyone but penalize by play style in an asymmetric fashion
i think theres definately a point in changing insurancemechanics but changing it will have quite deep and also unwanted consequences right now insurance in an unlimited resource that people can just endlessly use as extra funds for cheap fleet pvp get disposable firepower for about a third of its actual price if this mechanic is changed it should be changed in a way that doesnt discourage pvp unfairly but does reward people for managing risk well if for example it would cripple some 00mechanics there should be solutons found for that
it would be better to make insurance not pay out for ships lost due to illegal activities seeing as how pend insurance is under the concord banner it would be unrealistic that they would pay you if you lost your ship to a concord action in empire space
like kyoukoku said there already is a system that change your haspaid or whatever stat in the database theres no reason they cant make that same command cause the server to pause any skill in training you can manually press the pause skill button to stop skill training so making the server send that same command together with the change haspaid attribute to no command wouldnt be hard

why not incentiveise conventional warfare for the titan by giving it permanent siegemodule bonuses it can fit xl weaponry just like a dreadnaught howver it doesnt need to use isotopes to run it and id nerf back the tracking penalty somewhat plus the siege module would give a healthy bonus to tanking ability allowing it to hang around in combat moremake it mutually exclusive with dd usage so titan pilots cant sit there plinking ships and repeatedly firing its doomsdaycouple that with focused dd a lesser aoe dd which criples ships not destroy and youre probably enroute to a winner it would certainly make the clone vat more appealable
its the same argument you see with motherships only on a much larger scale why fly a huge isk risk if its too easy to kill motherships are dropping at a huge rate these days although its probably in line with their proliferation bc ccp didnt plan ahead on the actual investment for them in a cyno jammed system moms and titans are pretty nice tools outside of them theyre hugely vulnerable thus you see them on grid for 30 seconds and all fitted with cloaks if you gave a titan siege it would not stop 10 dreads from killing it and since most cap fleets now have 3080 dreads in them with some reaching 300 titans would have no use for a siege device like this no matter the tracking maybe if it had 30 mil armor wed see differently but with about 12 mil armor they die too damn fast if you can hold em downthere are situations now where a titan has a reason to stay on grid but siege mod will not add another one
so why not give titans 30 million hp i assume theres a good reason for this but it seems reasonable option to consider these things are bigger than some stations and yet they barely have more hp than a carrier
hows the soccer treating you yaay
there needs to be ways besides missions to gain standing i think the following ways to gain standing should be addedtrading every time you make a market trade buy or sell stuff in a station you get a small standing boost to that corp and a lesser boost to that faction traders would be able to get their standings up relatively rapidly similar to missions and nontraders would have their standings go up slowly over time to the corpsfactions that they interact with consistentlyrefining refining in a station should give a small boost to corp standings and a lesser one to faction standings reasoning is as above its stupid that miners should have to grind missions to get rid of the refining taxratting killing an npc rat from cosmic anomalies signatures or belts should give you a small faction standing boost to the enemies of the rats this should not apply to missionsrp reasoning for the above someone who is a wellknown customersomeone who refines at a corps station often someone who is a large participant in the market is going to be more wellliked than say some random guy who theyve never seen before as for gameplay reasoning it means that grindingmissions is no longer the way to get your standings up
i support the above product andor service
ive been calling for this for a while but am not entirely sure as of the alternate sources of standingi dont think these sources are good sorry because these are mundane tasks and would benefit mission runners most because they can refine and sell their loot for even more standing it wouls also result to buyyourstanding with people repeatingly buying and selling random items or buying random stuff off the market to refineas for ratting i think all amarr corps do not like the blood raiders how to determine what corp is the enemy of them anomalies would work though ive been thinking of that but the idea needs a lot of workso the title i surely agree on but the solution no keep discussing though
mission standing gains could always be reduced to compensate hell you could also make the standing gain only apply to reprocessing ores keep in mind individual trades would make very little difference the people who would notice an immediate standing gain that rivals missions would be the hardcore traders who buy and sell a lot of stuffor now that i think of it a better idea would be simply to give a bonus based on the active orders you have so fulfilling buysell orders doesnt yield the standing gain but setting up your own buysell orders and having others fulfill them does you could technically farm them this way but it would be slower than doing missions anyway so it would be pointless i dont think that standings should go up as fast as speedrunning missions does but i think it should be possiblei said faction not corp attacking blood raiders gives you a little bit of faction standing but no  standing to individual corps
now this idea i do like provides a way back for people whos standings have plunged into the basementso for example you kill a serpentis ratstanding with serpentis drops slightlystanding with gallente increases slightly cappedalternatively kill a minmatar shipstanding with minmatar drops slightlystanding with amaar increases slightlystanding with angels increase slightlyalso for those in 00kill a concord shipstandings with concord security status plummetsstandings with all pirate factions increasesnow it shouldnt be easy and the maximum increase through this should probably be capped at a point where you can get access to lvl 1 missions with maximum diplomacy though youll cripple the opposing standing doing this once you can access the agents then missions should be a more effective method of gaining standings and will have the added effect of letting you gain the derived standings through storyline missions
apologies that is something that would make sense yes and is something i could support since it lowers your standing with one faction it is not unreasonable to have an increase with others besides the concord status gain for pirate kills
i suddenly have misgivings about flying around in a pod
ha cockpit nice jobshow me your titles
well to be fair this is something virtually everyone knows
do ships even have cocpits i cant imagine anything bigger than a fighter having a cocpitccp please fix the word filter
would be interesting
well i just used the word cocpit to get my point across i could have easily said out of pod view or something along those lines
sorry   perhaps i should have included a smiley iconto me fluff isnt an insult   fluffbackstoryimmersionwhatever else that provides answers to questions like why do we have a third person view of our shipsi was implying that this camera drones story actually taught me something newhuglo
ah    forgot to mention   as cool as a coc    er    um    the view you are talking about might be i dont think it would be all that useful because of turrets that track targets in eve i am rarely looking towards the front of my ship    at least during the exiting moments anyway   now on the other hand if you were implying youd like an inside view of your ship looking out through the view screengoowindshieldwhatever like via star trek or something    then it might be nifty and as far as i know that sort of thing is planned for ambulationlo
ah ok yeh fluff is a fair surmisal cause in a sense it is that just whether it is good fluff that can add immersion or not sure something along those lines i dont think it would be a huge implementation and might add a nice touch though not necessarily for combat

i loved all the past alliance championships im sure lots of people loved them so could we get or get the csm to get one an answer out of ccp if they consider holding an alliance championship this year with the upcomming closing of the dedicated forum it looks very much like ccp is going to save the isk at least they could let us know also whith people rallying for musical instruments i think its time to voice our desire for yet another couple of weekends with fancy explosions or at least an answer by ccpdz
support ill make sure i get this question raised if we dont get a direct clarification from ccp in the interim its now too late for new issues to make the deadline for the 2nd formal meeting but if we dont hear anything in the next few weeks we can raise the question for the third
id like to see a comprehensive review of t2 production in eve online at present the fixed distribution model of t2 bpos leads to static gameplay as good t2 bpos will always be good t2 bpos and it encourages alliances to hoard good t2 bpos hacs some command ships etc while caring precisely nothing about bad t2 bpos ammo useless modules etcwould ccp ever consider introducing devaluation of t2 bpos  a system where eventually good t2 bpos will be produced out and it will be necessary to rediscover alternative sources and reestablish the t2 production chain using new bpos maybe rough timescale for producing out a t2 bpo would be 23 monthswould ccp be prepared to randomize the process of allocating produced items to t2 bpos perhaps once a particular good t2 bpo is produced out another good t2 bpo is allocated to another player somewhere in eve this could even be done by classes of t2 bpo ie that the reallocation would go to the correct itemtype but in anyones hangar and obviously youd need to adjust the numbers to ensure that you factor in bpo research time and instability into the number of t2 bpos needed to support current industry levelswould ccp be prepared to shake up politics and overstabilized production chains in eve by having the good bpos that are worth producing get produced out and get randomly respawned in the possession of other players that will need to be repurchased if existing profit and supply domination is to be maintainedwe have a suspension of disbelief issue with previously undiscovered good t2 bpos spawning in new players hangars obviously but its not much worse than the endless item production of t2 bpos by hugely industrialized alliances what i see with the t2 bpo distribution mechanics is a chance to spark real activity in the t2 bpo market again  real trading aimed at fiscal domination and maintaining control of a vital resource itd also give more value to the marketeer profession actually finding respawning t2 bpos and bring some much needed balance across the industrial alliances its quite senseless that there are only a handful of really good t2 production alliances in eve and lots of bad onesim a great believer that eve should have the ability to provide some lucky breaks to players prepared to do the leg work and take the risks and the principle that star fraction could randomly lose some zealot bpo that respawns in the hangar of burn eden or the internet frankly makes me smile with the anticipation of virtual profit loss make t2 production exciting again spark trading over t2 bpos and organizationallydiminishing resources make the economic distribution system a little more dynamic and watch the market and politics get more interesting  everybody winsnow these are very early thoughts and a broad proposal that basically says can we look at making production from t2 bpos more interesting and dynamicwhat do people think
i was just thinking it was time pro another remove t2 bpo post and here it is less than 5 minutes after the thought
thanks venkul mul  yep i missed that one good to link the issues
yeah the static sedentary nature of the t2 bpo market is really a detriment to the otherwise vibrant active economy that eve is known for the time for making a change in this area is well past there really needs to be a way for new industrial alliancescorps to participate
aw it looks like somebody is mad as hell over the moon thread that jade madeit looks like somebody is terribly terribly afraid of losing their cash cow
works both ways
6510
i have no t2 bpos that being said im all for getting rid of them however in a manner much different than described abovethe moon thread has good ideas in it to end 00 stagnation and make this game more about fighting for resources not camping them conversely this whine thread was designed only to discredit the othermakes sense that a member of a large ungainly 00 alliance with a ton of moons would be ed
the point is that jade made a suggestion that basically illuminates his shocking ignorance of moon mining and moon scanning the inherent problem with his suggestion is that finding valuable moons at all is an immensely time consuming process and having to rescan entire regions if the moons get randomly respawned would put them on par with current deadspace encounters this would only increase the camping of moon resources and drive up the price of t2 ships hence the shot at t2 bpos of which star fraction has quite a few thanks to their age and the lottery that was in place before invention instead of finding a way to make other moons equally valuable which would result in the depreciation of sfs precious t2 bpos his suggestion makes 00 even less valuable
read some of the other posts in that thread there are ideas of changing the system that dont include moving moonsit is an interesting topic changing up 00 and the way and reason space gets conquered
the t2 bpo issue is pretty interesting too i imagine there is a means of fixing it without moving the bpos it is an interesting topic changing up an entire market segment and the way and meansby which t2 ships get produced
comparing t2 bpos with moon mining is sillyt2 bpos and moon mining are similar in that both are isk printing machines the similarities end there t2 bpos are safe forever moon mining operations require a ton of logistics large setup costs and must be defended never mind the effort of breaking through a cyno jammer sieging at least one death star pos and fighting off the bridgedin defenders unlike t2 bpos moons fairly regularly change handst2 bpos are like a moon mining setup that never has to leave your hangar and doesnt require an alliance to defend
this isnt fair star fraction and the other old school alliances worked hard and put so much effort into winning their t2 bpohwait
i agree completely however while it is apparent that neither you nor i have any t2 bpos one of us is benefited by good moons and the other is notill go ahead and let you guess who hint its youthe venom expressed against an idea of changing up how moons work was surprising even though his suggestion of how to change it was pretty terrible there was a discussion going on in that other thread that had some other ideas until you decided to derail it in classic goon fashion
well i dont know where youre getting the crazy ideas about bpos randomly moving around among players but im all for t2 bpos turning into limitedrun bpcs so that over time they disappear from the gameits not fair that just because some guy ran a bunch of missions and hooked up with some research agents in 2005 or whatever that he forever has the economic advantage that i can never overcome no matter how good at invention i getalso generally speaking  everyone who has any advantage over me and i hope they die the csm is a pvp playground as much as the markets and gates are ingame anyone who cant see that is a fool
the difference is you could come and take my moons if you ever get a big enough set of balls we can never touch sfs t2 bpos there should be a way for guys like you and me to get involved in the t2 bpo market there were no valuable ideas in the other thread moon mining is an incredibly involved complex issue and the only ideas put forth were from individuals who clearly had no experience with moon mining and no grasp of the farreaching impact their ideas would have on the larger market youre basically complaining that goons are upset that jade is trying to change 00 a topic about which he knows nothing in such a fashion that he benefits financially from it
they never should have stopped the lottery thats the only way to make this right put it back in make is so that t2 bpos are devlaed to the point where they are sellign crap barely above making a scraping profit much like t1 everything
invention works just fine t2 bpos are no longer needed and are a throwback to a poor design decision many years agojust delete all t2 bpos
yeah lets get rid of t2 bpos i agreegoing after moons is a lot more than just an issue of testicular fortitude and you know it
moon require you to hold a pos on it provide fuel do logistical work etc etc etc t2 bpos require you to run them in a perfectly safe station yes t2 bpos do need more parity rolleyes
people that pay a years worth of profits for a t2 bpo are screwing themselves over already those that have the t2 bpos from past times have made a fortune already or theyre just failures the debate shouldnt be about whether or not t2 bpos should be removed but on how they will be removed they are a obsolete relict from past timeshere are three options delete them turn them into maximum runs bpcs turn them into bpcs with runs equaling one year running timeno new t2 bpos should be introduces in any way ever again
stain empire took 4 of our dyspro moons for nearly 6 months and were just now getting them back so yes its mostly testicular fortitude just because youre lacking doesnt mean it its some farreaching fantasy scenario
just delete the damn things the other two options can be achieved by using copy slots in a stationhopefully this is now the case
no support the op is proposing bringing back the t2 bpo lottery but this time without the requirement of obtaining rlps research loyalty points from research agents this would mean that everyone in eve would have a chance at obtaining a randomly spawned t2 bpo in their hanger lets seewho would that benefit possibly a really large alliance maybegoonswarm naw im sure thats just paranoia on my part more people  more chance of someone in the alliance getting the t2 bpo this is just goonswarm looking for another easy button im told wow is full of them maybe they should check it out people who have played this game for years are entitled to what they worked for one of the things that keeps coming out of goonswarm is their beliefdesire that people who have been playing a few months should be equal to people that have played for five years they want instant gratification and large easy buttonsthe owners of bpos are either those who got lucky in the lottery back when it was in place or those that paid enormous sums of isk for them either way they are entitled to the advantage they currently have in any case that advantage is not as large as it once wast2 bpos became considerably less valuable when invention started allowing anyone to create a t2 bpc as an example the price of a hulk went from around 500 million isk to around 100 million isk with invention came the demise of the lottery no more t2 bpos given out and lots of t2 bpcs being producedccp eliminated the lottery and replaced it with invention specifically to break the lock on the markets held by t2 bpo owners the idea is that attrition will eventually take its course and t2 bpos will inevitably disappear in the meantime the large advantage the t2 bpos once held is gonewindjammer
so its okay they they got lucky way back when but its not okay to get lucky now where the  is the logic in thatwindjammer
congratulations you just responded to a parody thread with a seriouspost of over 320 words thats over 1800 keystrokes at least you are officially the most dense person who still has the mental capacity to type coherent english sentenceshertford tell him what hes won
yes it was okay then and no its not okay now the logic is inherent in the situation how it changed and the reasons it changed my post 24 of this thread outlines the reasoning your inability to grasp it is either intentional or a genuine lack of competence either way its the response i would have expected from you given your choice in corporationswindjammer
in politics as in life its a joke until it isnt besideswhy would i pass up an opportunity to put in a well deserved dig to your alliancewindjammer
i think its more a case of tell him what hes lost
while t2 bpos are worth comparatively less then they once were it is beyond ed to suggest that they do not offer a substantial advantage today also how can you possibly equate winning a lottery with work individuals either got lucky or paid vast sums of isk that they have long since made back the people with t2 bpos did not acquire them through any means that a sane person could possibly describe as work and they most assuredly do not somehow deserve the massive advantage the t2 bpo confers also the lottery was discontinued well before i started playing eve and i have been here for over a year what about all the other players who are years old who never had a chance at the t2 lottery what arbitrary line in the sand do you have in mind for a player to actually matter enough to warrant access to t2 bpos take your elitist prick attitude and gtfowindjammer
how about all those who want t2 bpos removed from the game chip in and buy out those bpos from their current ownersafter they purchase the bpo they need only right click and choose trash to achieve their goalthe current owners are happy as they were fairly compensated for their efforts in aquiring said bpothose trashing the bpos are also happy because they were able to bring balance to the game
good idea how much for yours
why should those who want to bring balance to the game be punished for the unmitigated greed of those lucky few who are taking advantage of game mechanics that are no longer available to anyone elsei like that efforts in aquiring said bpo haha effort getting a lucky roll  effort please stop pretending t2 bpo owners exerted themselves somehow they get the last however many years of monopoly as fair compensation
invention has already accomplished thatt2 bpo holders however still rake it in over inventors who see their profit margin dwindle dailyexbarrage m bpo  build cost per unit 15 iskbarrage m bpc invention  build cost per unit 100 iskthis is if the inventor purchases all of the materials involved
yea lets get goons to roll in on another issue and all that jazz t2 bpos are no longer isk printing machines but they are an investment in a steady and modest income by any standards so against this eos bpo  makes less than 400 mill month deimos bpo  makes less than 600 mill month ishtar bpo  makes less than 1 bill month astarte bpo  makes less than 16 bill month just as examples and they require allot of work to keep up production of course those who are jealous will always find a fault with anything  and why should a guy who spent 30 bill on a bpo that makes less than a bill a month get to enjoy his achievement nawww we should remove them we should drag everyone into the gutter with us is that how it is
that dude that spent 30 bil on a t2 bpo deserves to get screwed over three ways for drowning a obscene amount of isk into a hopeless investment 30 months to get even how mentally degenerated do you have to be to invest even a single isk in something like thatt2 bpos are obsolete they should have been phased out a long time ago its about damn time this is finally happening
if you really feel strongly about the actual topic of t2 bpos you might want to start a nonjoke thread to discuss it i suggest starting a thread that requests the ccp agree preserve the status quo with t2 bpos until the end of the game including all of your justifications for why you think its fair because if some t2 bpohater gets to ccp first who knows what they might decide to do
delete themwindjammer
that is the point neither you nor i can dictate to someone else how to play the game but just because you feel that he deserves to get screwed over three ways for drowning a obscene amount of isk into a hopeless investment does not mean that it should happen  this is just your opinion on the matter eve will be around for about 67 more years at the moment a good t2 bpo is a valid investment if people have the isk to invest
more not less bposnot supporting a detrimental nerf plan
i would only chip in isk if it allowed me to ban people like you from the game
to me this reads like goons wanting only numbers to count in this game nothing more nothing less
im for removing them completely from the game
while i like the idea of forcing people out of npc corps this idea is too open to exploitation if this were implemented youd likely still see a bunch of macroing hulks and autopiloting freighters throughout empire they would just trade all of their materials over to a player corp character for sale that particular player corp character wouldnt even have to undock maintaining the current riskfree npc corp model
no newbies should be able to start corps as long as theyre willing to risk getting wardeccedeh maybe a couple days but not a full weekpossibly but it should be optional id like to see a way for the defenders to bargain for an end to the war and not get wardecced again 24 hours afterwards wardecs should not be totally bound to arbitrary objectivesalthough i suppose the closing of corporation would do that fineeh utterly pointless besides theyd always just choose closing of corporation so they dont have to worry about a premature endyesno thats unnecessary hassle instead of flagging the corp just flag everyone who is currently in the corp and joins in the future if you leave youre still a target for the duration of the war
to be honest it makes no sense to have a war in policed space remove it completely and force pvp into nonpoliced space it makes no sense for any security organization thats supposed to be uncorrupted to allow fighting in their jurisdiction remove flagging entirely as well both systems are entirely artificial
who ever said concord was incorruptible they just like blowing your ship up and look for any excuse they can find to do it fortunately they also like money
i think that this will actually end up helping new players start corporations instead of hampering themcurrently the cost of starting a corporation is trivial  a single destroyer this means that anyone can start a corporation by running a dozen level one missions and without really knowing how to cooperate with other people increasing this cost means that1 fewer caod alt posting corps will exist2 players wanting to start a corporation either have to work for a significant amount of time to do it on their own3 or they need to work together  the 100 mil starting cost is really the corporations first goalit will make it harder but i think the end result will help them instead of hurting them it will also help limit corp hopping which i think is an unintended feature of the corporation systemi think that a week would give them a decent amount of time to prepare for a wari wouldnt make it mandatory the objectives part is really a quantifiable way to show that a corporation has achieved victoryyou misunderstand  they would still be responsible for paying war fees every week the objectives are a way of having a public record of their victories this would be extremely important for the reputation of a mercenary corporation for example and a good way to determine of those you want to hire are worth what youre payingi wouldnt mind that either but im not sure how feasible it is from a technical perspective
123 and 4 i dont care about 5 and 6 are excellent however as it makes mercenaries viable
not sure i support all your ideas but i support this and that war decs need a complete rehaulmost importantly they need a winloss objective and an impact to the deccing corp if they fail their war objective plus a counter way that a corp who is war decced can achieve to end the war in a win or loss scenario
why this just puts artificial limitations upon war decs and adds pointless complexity
i dont think it should ever be required the objectives should be a way for1 attacking corps to have a tangible record of their accomplishments during wars2 defending corps to deny the attacking corporations these objectives which puts a blemish on their record
lets think outside the boxa lot of work and thinking has gone into trying to fix the attributes of abs and mwds in order to make them both have an equal use in pvp the end result seems to have have met with little success instead of choosing one based upon how it compares up to the other it should be based upon what one might encounter in the pvp field instead of boosting or decreasing the attributes of either module i propose we change each modules viability in pvp through the creation of a new longer range mwd webifying module ideas for this module goal only slow ships using mwds not afterburnersattributes needs a tweak to range or effectiveness against mwds that would give someone a reason to consider it over the webs available now incentive give the assault frigates a ship bonus to using the webs ie extended range for the module or increased effectiveness result now we might see some more abs and afs having a larger place in pvp and we see a defense against the nano strategy without destroying the tactic itself anyways that is just my favorite example whether or not people like that individual idea i still think we should start looking into what other aspects and elements of eve we can use to fix a percieved issue
sov should be determined by pvp imo and sov should be impossible to switch without a significant pvp confrontationif you want to make new pvp objectives to go alongside what we have and give them some sort of sov impact that is worth talking about so long as they actually encourage pew pew unlike some other suggestionsracing to mine or kill npcs shouldnt be what this is about and this could cause practical problem where sov gets switched accidentally between friendly organisations who ratmineplex in each others space affecting the function of critical infrastructure such as jump bridgesthis would also cause big problems for corps who hold sov but rent space outsov is about the ability to control space not about what you do with it
back in the days of the 1010 plexs being static the average alliance member would never be allowed to see them in fact it was impossible for anybody other than a select few to ever run them this was bad for eve as a whole and ccp fixed it with explorationtoday static pos are the new problem moons generating tens of billions a month now mean superblobs are requred to remove them all the crap associated with lag etc is all over possthe small raiding gang or solo pvper cannot do anything vs the static pos income generator the average alliance member rarely sees the wealth of the moonsso whats the solutions first leave existing mining pos as they are but boost the average members ability to get them dynamically such assun harvestingwarningrp on small superheated debries from failed planets and moon orbit the suns in small almost invisible asteroid belts molecules thick when harvested can give small quantities of materialwarningrp offyou harvest suns and get random moon mins from there slowlythe pros for the average alliance memberthe average alliance member can now get into the reactions game as well he can also start to make wealth from the busy t2 market people will no longer need to superblob to defendattack poss unless its for sovrignitythe pros for the small gangraiderssolo pvperyou jump in local and most of the time they warp out by the time you find out which belt they are at and warp to them even expert scanner users can take a minute to get to their targetnow you simply jump in and warp to the sun for a fight meaning that findng targets is easierthe loosersthe trillionare alliance leader who makes his isk from poss will lose out also oversupply of moon mins wont be a issue if ccp seperate sovrignity claiming poss from mining poss the only reason why there is a oversupply of crap moon mins because they are actually free since the pos only exists for sov so even at a loss these mins make a profit if you see what i meanwhat do you think would be a good solution to empowering the average alliance members and promoting small scaleraidingsolo pvp
supporting my own topic oh and remember that people can still mine moons as per now we are taking about empowering alliance grunts and pvpers insted of superblobs vs trillionare alliance ceo
bull anyone with any kind of ing balls could challenge plex gangs they were exactly what you claim to want small gang high level pvp fights except with no need for soul grinding  like probing for hours on end which is something absolutely nobody but the most worthless carebear  wantsyour idea is  by the way and barely makes sense i dont see why people would stick around at the sun doing whatever if local is filling up its not like a plex with a limited resource that you have a reason to fight over
plexs would denay their own alliance and plexs were abused by plex farmers stealing keys and overseer spawns etc that ruined it if plexs had no keys and you could go the the final stage then fine
i like this idea
isnt this just a somewhat poor rehashing of the wormholes ideas
how about requiring that a pos be anchored at the gate to maintain it with the pos  some gate fuel costs the gates are not near moons so the pos cant be used for that purpose or likewise found by simply warping to a moon the gate always requires a large tower and uses 70 of a nonfaction towers cpupg resources more difficult to deathstarone caveat the derelict gate does not use jump bridge fuel and sometimes does not even function requiring repairs so it is not an assured asset all the timerequiring a pos to hold it means that people wont be spamming instas on the jita market for hidden gates that only warp you directly to a deathstar d
good points windjammer i suppose my idea would require lightingfast response times of the shield transfer ship and that would also probably be unrealistic which goes against my purpose of getting a more realistic scenario but if this did happen at least the above scenarios would provide for more pvp action in the end i think tradable kill rights will give the best solutionheres another thought  and intermediate kill right option lowsec sheriffs empire factions could dispense sheriff licenses for a fee of course and requiring a very high sec status giving the pilot the right to agress concords enemies in lowsec spacethis would jive with the backstory concept of factions out sourcing customs officers and fw fighters and would give another pvp opportunity just as the wild west needed sheriffs to tame the lawless bordertowns factions could hire pilots to laid down the law in lowsec systems beyond their control instead of gate campers you could have gate keepers who protect passing ships from attacks anyone getting concord aggro with an unprovoked attack would also get the aggro of any sherrifs in the system who could have 1530 mins to hunt down the agressor or at the very least protect the wreck could get agro for wreck thieves as well of course the sheriff would lose hisher license and get a hefty sec hit for abusing their powers such as stealing the wreckage themselves or colluding with the gankers etc okay shoot away
first off let me apologize if i step on anyones toes or failed to read the thousands upon thousands of words in this thread i got as far as 2 pages before i saw a repeating pattern ofwell you know the deal alreadybut a few things didnt get mentioneda your focusing on the ganker arent you forgetting about the alts and the people who loot who gives a flying rip about the ganker if your going to ignore the real problem of the looters i mean all it takes is one stupid frigate or something to start firing on a defenseless freighterindy and then all those fun little battle cruisers show up and loot the tar out of youpersonally i think the concord strikepenalty should extend to them as well but i have no idea how that could be implimeneted from a programming standpoint so scratch that oneb insruance being nerfed wouldnt do much you need to remember that the ganker dosent care about his ship hes not even likely to insure unless its a bit spendy anyway if you really want to have an impact then you could take away his insurance rights for the say the sovereign nation of the region but would that really have an impact the insurance is given by a particular npc corp is it not surely they can slap a standing on you as well im sure they dont appreicate you blowing there money away without some sort of uh kick back that could work too large fines and penalties or somethingc now im going to admit there are valid reasons for the ganking but you need to remember something folks the issue is not the legitmate tactical manuvers of ganking its every tom  and moron who dosent give a rip about what you think and just want to make money the cheap and easy way they dont give a rip about the honor of combat they do so under the false pretense of it would ruin the game if it was otherwise and blah blah blah cry me a river type of attitude and what do you get for your trouble nothing except more trouble new gamers who show up and try to play the game arent going to tolerate excuses by saying this is the way of the game when they just started playing for a month or so hell id be ed too while i happen to agree that high sec shouldnt be impervious the penalties for scerwing around in high security should be obsencely higher oh sure you can do what you want just be prepaired for consequnces of your actionspersonally that kind of behaivour is dishonoable and cowardly at least the piracey that takes place in low sec has the intent of taking you out and flying off with your goods with its ship in tact somehow i doubt the true nature of pirates didnt count on respawningif you get killed you lose the game so to speak its just stupid to exploit a concord attack where your forcing the gankee to have no choice but to just curl up and die because in reallity thats what your doing oh sure you can buy ships that can handle it but only if your a frakking billonare ever look at a fenrir that big freighter is sweet for hauling crud but you cant outfit that thingand even if you could wont amount to muchescorts wont work in high sec as you already know concord will fire on them too if they do not have kill rights now if killrights where granted to members of the fleet thats different but stillpersonally im agianst ganking because its not my style but should it be taken awaynopeshould it be stopped hard to dobut for us pilots who want to enjoy the game and not worried about some lame cheapskate would be nice not to worry about that in high security spacehopefully we can spend more time working on a solution and less time defending the right to oh and again im just sharing my 2 cents after all i bought the game id like to have a say in this mess tooi like honorable combat and a fighting chance bankrupting the gankee isnt nice
i really dislike it too couldnt agree with you more and in general i really really really dislike nerfs of any kind nerfs represent a devoluition and decrease in dynamics i believe evolution should be the preferred method of problem solving thus increasing dynamics evolution of ammunition etc could have been made to counter nano speeds but thats not the way ccp chose to gothe only reason i put forth this proposition was because its going to be much worse the way ccp has proposed it be done ccps way  nerfing a fair number of items in the game my way  nerfing one item my way  a direct and controlled nerf affecting nothing but the intended target of the nerf ccps way  indirect potentially uncontrolled nerfs affecting more than the intended target of the nerfsthe nano speed nerf is going to happen the only question is which way do you want it to be implementedregardswindjammer

yes that would be cool i would like it to work when in sapce and your looking at 20 to 30 hangers and trying to remember where the hell you put that domination gyro

bad idea if there is to be an interstellar ups it should be done by the players the tradecourier business works just fine no need to interject npc shipping fees and transport
there are too many stations in hisec its too hard to get your courier contracts filled in time compared to filling a buy order at a hub any big trading organization without the computer aided systems like ups has would face numerous deadheads have to face orders too small and have a huge pain in the ass dealing with the number of contractsthus the only contracts are usually freighter sized to be worth the time to find thema courier system would increase market integration and vastly increase the potential for traders to turn some fast industrial isk
not sure if i support a dedicated suicide vessel given theres no actual death in eve but id like for the oppertunity of ramming speed and the possibility to inflict damage if going down with your ship means that you dont eject in a pod you blow with the ship as it rams into the enemy
so long as it takes out your pod too id support it
not supportingthere are currently already plenty of serious tactical options out there adding this one would just create silliness think suicidejihad by goonswarm id prefer ccp spending time on more serious things then this
wouldnt need to be database intensive all it needs is a list of people whos contracts you want to ignore stored locally on the client not the server then when you open the contracts window the server sends the full list to the client which then filters out the ones you dont want to see
currently the only thing truesec affects rattingwise are the potential spawns one sees in the belts this would make one think that systems with a truesec of 7 and lower would just be chock full of triple 15 battleships and such but as i am sure anyone who has ever hopped into a raven can assure you this is note the case even systems that are as good as 10 are still infested by the sorts of cruiser and battlecruiser spawns which arent even worth the ammo making ratting an already tedious and unrewarding activity even moresowhat i suggest then is that truesec becomes more of a sliding scale wherein the better a system gets the better the worst potential spawn becomes for example a system with 8 sec would not only be capable of 17m battleship spawns or whatever it is but it would be incapable of spawning any battleships worth less than 1m so on it would work with deepening truesec meaning progressively better and better spawns all aroundthis would i feel accomplish the dual purpose of making ratting generally more profitable and further give more incentive to hunt out the better ratting spots making 00 realestate currently thought to be worthless by many beyond their dysprosium content much more valuable and spurring more conflict in their acquisition and defense thank you and goodnight
yo hey forgot to do this

ive tried to regather all of our ideas and get our main goals presented more clearly inviting all to keep hacking away at this issue of ty poss doing too many jobs and doing them terriblyacdc  the road to proposal for better a 00
if someone es you off because they say something bigoted or otherwise offends you youve petitioned it and you still hate them for it   i dunno    put a bounty on them if you cant find them and pod them yourselflo
aweseme capsuleers deserve coolerim going to attempt to tie back all of the contributions to ideas for better sov and get the concepts that are definitely working more organized i will leave some room to add links to other threads as the concept is far too large to manage in one threadplease amend to this list any concepts that are missing and try to point out concepts that are not fundamentally soundthe root of all these problems is that poss were conceived to address too many things and in order to balance with their many roles have become a huge pile of middleground solutions that have too many sideeffects like pos spam blob warfare and overall boring 00 structureslayered 00 warfare for fleet and smallmidsize gang objectivessovereignty structures should be few and should function as legitimate devices of contesting system ownershipobjectives that are to represent the final word in who owns a system must balance for timezonesobjectives with higher vulnerability should have the cost of defeat represented by amount of time spent in the defeat condition more fuel use less mining performed and lower security and inherent loss of economic activity this balances for timezones since no loss or victory is total or instantaneousfighting the passivestayathome allianceall passive income streams must be vulnerable to disruption cost of this disruption is limited mainly to lost production that wont resume without player actionlogistics load of maintaining sov structures and the potential for decreasing that load through mechanisms of additional vulnerability should be increasedstructures that grant advantages to 00 powers ability to maintain their territory and bypass nonsov threats should be vulnerable to nonsov threatsmaking sovereignty more meaningfulseparation of logistics pos and structures controlling sovereignty planetary defense platforms for a less numerous and more consistent basis of 00 sovseparation of residents from owners of system new facilities for renters and carebears with mechanisms of benefiting the sovereignthese structures will also serve as the basis of 00 nonsov residencemore longterm routes of investment in infrastructure that are based on direct involvement think of pos flogging the dead horse and starbase logistics is needlessly soul destroying threads in context of these changesbetter sov contesting combatposs were meant to act as fight brokers that determine when a sovcontest will occur this has the undesirable sideeffect of guaranteeing fleet combat in which there is almost never a partial victory or lossmoar should be moar but less should be lessreplacement fight broker must demand constant involvement across several grids simultaneously to change combat dynamicsdesired goal is increased headroom for tactics and good coordination leadership to allow outnumbered attackers and defenders routes to levy their toll beyond what they can in headon fleet combatsecondary goal is to reduce lag increase headroom for larger battles and reduce lags impact on effectiveness of superior tactics
nice work i linked this in the op of my assembly hall proposal as a good summary of our think tank just watch that the smallmid size gang involvement is in a support role rather than the main spearhead of an operation
they shouldnt be the main spearhead they should be skirmishers scout around give everybody time to bring the heavy hitters to bear inflict some damage run away when it comes time for beating down harass where you think youre not getting yourself killed and then if theres any scraps of the enemy force for you to face after you win they go mop them up the same role as light cavalry slingers and all the other quick light units that got sent out ahead of the real army in premodern warfare interceptors are functionally close to horse archers asisthey dont hurt too much without huge mass but theres bugger all a slower force can do about them goals for small gangs should be in the same sort of vein
any replies to topics of what small gangs should accomplish should be filed in this dedicated threadregardless of what anyone feels ccp is probably going to make some changes its up to us to come up with good changes and ensure were not left with pile of  v20linkage
this is a great summary of base principles i think the goal is to achieve the most elegant solution that incorporates these in the minimum number of changes to the current mechanics
op nice post not the wording i would use but i agree with the sentiment
all id like to know is wtf are goons doing as csms nothing like having the ultimate carebear lying exploiting cheating corp having a say in the future of the game
probably because they were voted ingonna have to elaborate there  condoned by eve  but follow the eula i guess the largest corp brings in a little bit of game experiencebut its ok youre the first person to point this out the very first one you should bring more topics like this into the spotlight
real carebears dont lie exploit or cheat goons may claim to be the ultimate carebears but they clearly suck at it and im not afraid to say sospeaking as a carebear though im actually glad that there are goons as csms sure i dont enjoy playing the game in the same way they do and i might never agree with more than one word in twenty that they say but they do represent the interests of a large section of the player base and have a good deal of experience in their playing arena and some of them are even intelligent and atriculate no reallywhat would be absolute hell would be a csm made up of nothing but empire huggers too afraid to step into low sec for fear of being ganked thats me we need a decent crosssection of the playing population to make the csm actually useful and to look at all sides of any issue before submitting it to the kingdom of devness in icelandia
im thinking up some new ideas just from reading what kelsins arguing1 should huge passive income streams be invulnerable to disruption2 should living in a system as a productive citizen mean interference with the sovereigns3 should living in a wellkept empire mean exposure of these citizens to all the lawlessness of virgin 00im going to say no to all three here are some solutions ive come up with let me know how they sit with this discussion circle1 to seperate the idea of living in a system and having sovereignty over a system id like to see something on the order of colonies implementedcolonies could be like the infrastructure you provide to your local population of care bears that allows them to live in your space and perform economic activity and defenses cough without allowing them access to your outpostcolonies should have separate modules that allow them to perform many of the rites of station services refining trading repairs etc these modules store taxes in their own facilities sort of like communal grain mills that keep a portion if you raid them you can steal the stuff thats kept as well as disrupting operationscolonies under the protection of a defense platform are indestructible2 on moons the fix is simple instead of harvesting arrays have a system of drones that do all the mining theyre vulnerable while en route back inside the bubble if you cant redeploy them every so often or defend them you lose access to your sitbackenjoytheisk income hp is about that of a bs they have to move a few kilometers to get inside the bubble can be interdictedeconomic sovereignty requires defacto sovereignty is my angle yes you will get attacked by people at odd timezones these attacks will not be sovchanging fleets but small groups of raiders no excuses for not doing something about themin orbit around planets it should be possible to construct a harvesting platform like other modules under the colony system they are a passive income system that is vulnerable to disruption the platform itself is indestructible when protected by a planetary defense platform but the shipments of goods are not they are harvested by drones that warp back and forth to the platformgas giants provide gas products solid planets provide solid products availability is much more equal than moon mineral availability3 gate guns are kinda cool i am attracted to them if they lock slowly theyre not a fence but an antifence you can pass through but you cant stay very valuable to those living in a 00 empirepossibly another option since colonies and defense platforms can be in any system would be to have a protective shield on the colonies and outposts like a pos expose some of the more passive elements of income and infrastructure to small gangs but give back a little in the form of letting the defenders undock and get organized to attack those threats
1 you can already disrupt income streams2 jade mentioned this very idea in iceland it was a bad idea then and its a bad one now making a boring system more boring because you think it might be personally interesting to sit there and shoot drones all day isnt a solution3 im not quite sure what the question here is but 00 is lawless by design to change that changes both the fiction and the nature of the gameplay
seriously darius a pos is a giant macrominer that cant be removed without winning a sovcontesting battle one that currently is guaranteed to be a giant fleet fight where being severely outnumbered means assured defeatim not asking to take a hundred guys and win against a thousand but id like to do a hundred guys worth of damageyou seem so confident in all your statements that an alliance shouldnt have to put up with a small gang when that gang has no capability to affect the alliance as a whole in a sov contesting battleshould they not have to put up with it at all thats essentially what youre arguing im arguing that an alliance should have to deal with smaller threats as smaller threats nonlong term consequences to short term disruptions
small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances small gangs can already impact the finances and operations of large 00 alliances
in all seriousness as ive already stated the nature of what youre asking for already exists try it some time im confident in my statements because we have small gangs they disrupt enemy operations i know this because i read their forums i said this in iceland when the bad moondrone idea you magically came up with was mentioned the same person proved their lack of knowledge on the subject by stating that nobody is ever financially damaged by sov warfare
i cant touch moon mining in a rapier
you cant touch a nyx either how should we redesign the game to make sure you can conquer large things solo in your tiny insignificant hull
there you go again its not about wanting to take over the world in a kestrel all im asking is that its not possible to simply ignore everything from a kestrel up to pos siege gang10 hippies crossing the road wont make the world change but youre bent on the notion that since they cant make the world change you shouldnt have to deal with them at allat current if its not a sovchanging gang it can be ignored 100 stay at home tactics ftwto all economics and logistics disruptions the same defense will work 100 get to the station safe up and cloak jump clone somewhere else the bad hippies will go away
this is the basis of your argument and it is patently false
alright tell me what theyre going to dostation services ten hours of shooting anyonethis s boring and bad for the game at least if there were some cost associated with leaving such a gang to rot in space there would be an incentive to get a gang together instead of just deciding to rearrange the hangar
im going to take this another direction you think im talking about running around in a bunch of velators and breaking the foundation of an empire instantlyim not asking for permission to win at the gamethere needs to be more granularity between going out to reinforce towers and camping a jb in an sbsomething in between reinforced and incappedbest ive come up with so far is a structure that can be unaligned by shooting it tripping this condition immediately sends it into a localized reinforcement that eats a tiny amount of stront at a constant rate until its repaired and gives back unused stronta gang of ten domis wont burn down your hardware but they will disrupt the operations until you realign them however that works or catch them in the first placeread me clearly some objective in between the 35m shield required to take a tower into reinforced and the lucky breacher who finds a lone haulermore granular exposure for more granular losses
i never said sov warfare was perfect i said turning it into faction warfare isnt the answer turning it into cs in space isnt the answer you can run gangs through 00 right now and kill people and that hurts does killing a few battleships hurt yes should a small fleet be able to dent an alliances sovreignty by playing minigames no not as theyve been presented thus faras it stands today the barrier to entry for 00 is very high yet somehow people manage to do it there is no entitlement to the space for you or anyone else it takes superior leadership and organization it should i think one thing people could spend more time thinking about is why are so few successful and how can we enable more people rather than how can i change 00 to make my fleet of 12 stealth bombers sov killersedit to clarify im not against changes to the way things work in 00 im against the ones that have been proposed thus far as the fundamental reasoning behind them is wrong leading to poor mechanic suggestions in most cases its because of ignorance but that does not make them correct
darius ive been following your replies to threads like these for a while its not about fairness or making the game ut2kwhat twenty pilots can do a hundred pilots can do five times better more granularity of exposure and more granularity for hits to static processes wont change goons or anybody elses place in the gamewhat it will do is open up the field for a few hundred pilots to bypass the main fleet and go cause disruptions at home across a wide territory and engage in a more mobile warthis isnt really what im after though ive been throwing the bulk of my efforts and decentralizing pos combat to create some more realistic area of engagement than meet us at 511 tomorrow at 842 bring your blobmore granular targets in the home territory are just one other way of accomplishing this relationship more opportunities to wear on an alliance than just at the pos combat
still there needs to be realistic limits on what small gangs can accomplish and i dont think killing pos should be within their capabilitiesthey could do small objectives that make the big battle easier but shouldnt be the big battle
ive supported smallgang reinforcement a time and fuel expense but never smallgang pos destruction a sov and property expenseill leave the implementation out of it but for instance id like to see this as a possibilitytwenty man gang goes in and chews on moon miner for two hours while dodging pos fire moon mining discontinued until somebody hops out there with a carrier or ospreys and dodges twentyman gang firethis is granularity its not a large expense its somewhere between changing the map and costing the holding alliance some money for leaving you alone
and subtle too
i was very impressed by the eloquence i know hes basically already driven to insanity by having to deal the arguments for sov changing hands over something trivial like capture so its an understandable reply
it doesnt make him wrong small gangs have a tactical role already and theres nothing more small gangs can do because of timezones
i didnt claim it made him wrong i claimed it made him a prick who wasnt contributing much of anything to the conversation hardly unique around these parts of courseand i include myself in that but that doesnt stop me from poking fun
darius frankly youre reading what you want to read rather than what is there nobody has proposed anything close to 12 stealth bombers become sovkillers or cs in space here or anywhere else and in fact in this very thread people have agreed on just the opposite the baseless comments youre making are unconstructive to the point of trolling lets get back on track please this is a very constructive thread and obfuscating the discussion with offtrack rants demeans the openminded and productive debate that was taking place
hey kelsin you might some perspective on this issue youre in a non00 alliance why dont you start a thread outliningdiscussing the reasons that a competent healthy and motivated highsec or lowsec alliance cannot realistically break into 00 and thrive there under the current system then we can look at ways to enable more people to attempt to play kingofthehill in 00
tell that to gs blackops small shipsmall gang force that lives in enemy territory disrupting logistics ratting mining etc they were a prime driver in the collapse of bruce a couple of months ago
trollthe answer is because pos warfare is about capitals and who can field the most shyt at a scheduled battle no amount of tactics can make up for that moment when youre cynod in on by a hundred caps 00 presence is black and white when it comes to differentiating the capitally rich with the capitally poori have been a part of this on both ends up in the north poor little noncoalition alliances getting overwhelmed by 100 caps and who cares what they had down in the southern north watching smash dissolve and rk turn terroristthis is why im pushing mainly to increase the legitimacy of sov holding tools such that they allow more room for tactics and skillim avoiding being robin hood its not about saying a huge fleet shouldnt be more effective than a smaller fleet i want to open up the field for a tactically immaculate attack carried out against a lazy enemy to give them the upper hand at current its blob vs blob on one grid with general lag leading his forces against general desynch in a contest of nerves in tolerating such a randomized situation
their towers didnt get burned out by blackops gangs in the end affecting sov requires capitals because the fights are scheduled and happen on one grid they require moar capitalsi only want to change the fights to multigrid
nande just ignore the trolls  keep engaging in thoughtful discussion and it will bear fruit ccp already agrees with many of the basic principles weve been talking about and its simply a matter of distilling them into a few proposals without getting derailed by trollingid just advise sticking to base principles for the most part so as not to get off track and a good list of changes can be developed to put through to the csm
not that i particularly see myself as a neutral broker but being neither with goons nor star fraction im taking the opportunity to call out anyone who goes over the table as a trolltomans post was 100 troll star fraction is out of providence because of cva or whatever and toman was trying to poor some salt on that factanyone who attempts to disrupt discussion with no clear goals for progress will get toasted when it comes time to bring a final proposal to the csm
im not trolling im really interested in hearing what the problems areas for what you suggested about needing 100 caps whats stopping you as highsec or lowsec alliance all it takes to get a 100strong capfleet is isk and capcapable pilots anyone can train for caps and anyone can earn the isk for them they honestly dont cost that much for example star fraction has a notinsignificant capfleet without being a 00 entity and nothing is stopping them from getting moreso i dont really buy your first justification for why a healthy determined highsec or lowsec alliance cant carve out space in 00 under current mechanicsno i wasnt the only things i know about sf are that they have a number of capital pilots and a lot of t2 bpos nothing about their history in 00 i had no idea theyd even tried to head into 00 in the past serious question suppose sf or pick another highseclowsec alliance with some potential i dont know any by name wanted to take geminate for themselves what game mechanic is going to unfairly get in their way what unopposable roadblock will defeat themlook at tri vs hydra right now tri had lost all its 00 space but now theyre on their way to taking some
hes drawing you offtopic nande there is not a question of why cant alliance x do y the question is how to improve the territory control system of eve
i think an important part of identifying the ways to improve the sov system is to identify all the problems with it youve already identified one wellknown problem the game cant tolerate a lot of ships on a single grid or a single node for that matter but there are other problems that need to be addressed i think that one important problem is the perception that its not generally possible for a capable group of people to get a foothold in 00 and begin to expand we should pin down what game mechanics make 00 so static and think of ways to address themof course if im interrupting a private conversation between you two then feel free to ignore me or you might want to take it to email or something if youre having trouble filtering out the noise
ive never argued that its impossible i have argued that pos warfare is broken and one of the consequences is inability to affect sov except through mechanisms that force small powers to play into the hands of large powersthere are 11000 carriers in eve im aware theyre not incredibly hard to come bythe weapon of outnumbered forces throughout the history of mankind has been and always will be skirmish tactics and using superior mobility and tactical freedom of not being large and sedentary eve pos combat gives us scheduled battles that completely negate any of those skirmish tactics and in fact place all sovereign emphasis on giant fleet battles that are filled with lag further negating any usage of tacticsthe mechanics of pos warfare designed to prevent time zone abuses are accidentally killing off the best weapon of outnumbered forces darius and other voices continually argue that nothing should be done to nerf large alliances as if people have a right to 00 the issue isnt the inherent strength of numbers but that smaller powers dont have access to their logical warfighting tools of choice and are forced by mechanics designed to address time zone imbalance to fight on the favorable terms of a larger forcegoons themselves didnt win the battle in syndicate against bob they made it to where there could be no winner using zerg tactics and a bunch of alts bob had nothing left meaningful to destroy to a large alliance who is established in 00 getting wiped out means a huge loss of property and infrastructure zerg tactics cant work thereim working to undo the accidents of timezone balancing as well as add tactical mechanisms of not fighting on the larger powers terms there should be no entitlement to favorable engagements for larger powers
i dont find that perception or the perceived problem itself to be an issue if you do feel free to come up with ways to address it but its just a trollthings that do need improving in 00separation of logistics security and sovereigntyopportunities for guerilla attacks against infrastructureincreased tools for territory securitythe above addressed with an eye to layering of vulnerabilities to encompass siege fleet and small gang tactics
i kinda feel like this whole issue is driven by ccps request for design ideas for smallgang objectives in sov warfare and not by any genuine passion for change along those lines in any large segment of the player base theyre looking for grassroots solutions to a problem that doesnt really bite the grass roots i can see why youre really eager to hold on to the focus of anyone who will actually continue to have this conversation with youif ccp hadnt put out that rfp asking for smallgang objectives in sov warfare i wonder if we would have seen any serious suggestions along those linesi mean i agree that since they asked for it and people have ideas that they should get those ideas to ccp and its fun to discuss and all i just kind of wish the effort would go to problems that a lot of players have with the game rather than problems that ccp has with the game v0v
my personal issue is that we the north rolled up some alliances without much thought not because they werent smart willing and prepared it was because the nature of pos warfare forced them to engage us on 100 unfavorable fleet termswhen it came time for smash to dissolve and rk was still going i sympathized with rk for having the fortitude to stick with the fight i knew that just like the alliances we rolled up in the north earlier rk was at best going to get thrown into losec before any resurgencethe timezone balancing mechanisms of poss stick everyone into a horridly boring and overly straightforward engagement with very little room for good pilots and good commanders to make a differencein the end i think everyone will recognize huge benefits of better sov tools less boring pos shooting more room for tactics less lag more measured defeat or loss the end of pos spam better 00 empiresmany of the goals of small gang objectives can be achieved through better pos warfare but i dont think pos warfare is a comprehensive solution i dont believe its time yet to abandon small gang objectives this is the logical weapon of choice when outnumbered
i think were getting way too scattered on this issue of the small gang crapcan we agree to come back on sunday and basically just let the topics go for a few daysim going to work on a solution in the meantime that will be based on this entire whole giant ball of discussiontheres a lot of it and pretty much everyone has some valid points im getting lost myself just in the shear volume of concerns that must be balanced before any real meaningful solution can be fielded given i am not in a large alliance have been in a large alliance and plan to someday be back in a large alliance i think i can come up with a solution that has a little bit of something for everyone and in the end looks like a giant sundae of delicious treats
i guess its a bit of a tangent but can you elaborate on what youre saying about rk we had a number of memorable for me anyway fights against them over their pos in several fights they outnumbered us after looking at their ship fittings on kms and listening to recordings of what was going on on their ts i really doubt that tz or membershipnumbers issues were why they failed i mean they didnt even bother to time most of their pos they just maxstronted them and hoped for the bestbut suppose that there was a tz issue couldnt they have also have attacked our towers outside of our prime they were smaller at the alliance level than us but they could still field 200 man fleets seems like they could have gotten something going
this has probably been all over coad and id like not to turn it into that but here was the war in geminate as i saw iti got back to that thing after coming back from japan at that point rk numbers were at about half smash was basically gone when you were in qt i was watching capitals running for their lives towards losec the dissolution of smash whered peoke go i think contributed more than anything to a lack of confidence that robbed a lot of fighting spirit and eventually lead to total implosion the general feeling was definitely that the battle was uphill and it would be better to wait for redswarm to go home and take back territory from the new pets there was a huge amount of uncertainty over the point in flying a bs in the face of titans i cannot for one second fail to recall that my alliance mates were getting very weary of flying against alliances with titans to this fact our support fleets got smaller and smaller and then there was no point in flying our caps or thats what our cap pilots thoughtit boils down to this pos warfare is a guaranteed fleet battle with very little room to make up for numbers people know its black and white so when the confidence is gone you see the whole alliance heading straight down people dont fit to win a fight if they dont think they can win suddenly the numbers are not packing a punch trust is replaced with bitternessi cant speak for most of the large fights and definitely none of the early ones what you see in later combat is that people dont expect to be able to win outright so they start clinching assets and engaging with trash even i was running around with t1 crap at that point doing little more than meatshield workif pos combat were improved such that the mechanics arent guaranteed to be brutal to the less potent blob you would see alliances holding onto morale for a much longer stretch people would believe more in the ability to craftiness and you would see more attempts to make up ground through underhanded crazinessits a selffulfilling prophecy of a losing alliance but even if it werent the facts of pos warfare ensure that once we were offbalance there was no coming back smash scattered to the wind quickly and so my direct involvement was gone but still i didnt like the situation for rk
this is a pretty hot topic and i dont want it to keep clogging threads on sov mechanicsproblemthe problem were after is stayathome tactics weve all done it you bring twenty guys into system after system to find people docking up everywhere you advertise your location and all they do is wait it out they have fifty people sitting in the station you claw your eyeballs out and pray to god for your money back for that monthstayathome tactics should not be a costless alternative to declining an enemys invitation for some healthy midsize gang combat ive done this stuff even when outnumbered its fun its a weekend lets go pew pew with the neighbors it wouldnt be bad if it happens more oftensolutionintermediate goals will exact a toll on stayathome tactics and form an extra incentive to get a gang together and go fight that is what were after i fly to go shoot the enemy i probably shoot enemy ground rules for specific solutionsive made a lot of proposals about smallgang objectives that are in between changing the map and camping an empty system pos destruction or other sov changing activity is out of the question a task that should requires a siege gangmy recommendation for any small gang objectives is that they disrupt things temporarily and do not cause lasting property or sov damage that is you can skirmish the hell out of a defending alliance and cause them lots of headaches but you cant burn down their towers without going toe to toe in fleet combatto summarizestayathome tactics blowany intermediate goals should not be sovrelated or involve property lossexpenses of a successful guerrilla operation should involve fuellost productionthe easiest way to measure the success of such a war is what portion of 23 hours a day do we have their logistics screwed upthe metric is time in the success condition vs time in the defeat condition how many hours a day can you keep your mining array online etc thus the conditions are automatically balanced for timezone strength if theyre holding you offline 22 hours a day its not because they attacked at 3amso thats it where do we draw the line on what a smaller gang can do and cannot do
should be able to go into a system and lock it down camp gates camp stations basically the presence of a small gang should be a disruption to individual moneymaking like missions ratting and asteroid mining the only thing a small gang can do is make everyone run awaybecause of timezones small gangs are too dynamic to have the ability to damage anything static like logistics if timezones werent a problem and we all played 247 then it may have worked but its a video game we balance with rl and thats the situation we have to work around
my objection to this as a goal is very simple hey guys lets go camp their station and the less we get to shoot the more were doing our jobyour arguments are precisely why im hardlining the assertion that any smallmidsize gang objectives should only really be effective when you win consistently and the defender never responds make them easily repaired and have no loss of property cost is through time spent in the disrupted state not whats destroyed or capturedfor instance suppose a moon miner is more like a ship with 5m hp that cant be engaged by a dread moving target oh god but can be trapped outside the bubble before making the delivery run and slowly pecked into a reinforcement that burns a small amount of stront but gives back all stront once the shield is healed5m hp is easily within striking distance of a handful of hacs flying between pos guns for an hour or so its just something do do in between the we have defacto sov in your territory and the were burning down your towers phase it would give defenders more reason to come out of the station and attackers something to do in betweenbingo smallgang objective thats not timezone unfair and gives an incentive to go fight instead of waiting for the bad hippies to go away
it is timezone unfair if i can go shot your npc moon miners during your nonprimetime anything that requires a constant presence around the clock is timezone unfair
theres a major differencein pos warfare if i can tear down your tower at 3am i can put it up with my own i have caused an irreversible loss of hardware instantly i have gained a strategic advantage overnight i could use this to change sov overnight this is why sov needs such strong timezone balancewith disruption over time objectives you can stop the bleeding at 6am the enemy can only cost you money if you fail to respond at all they can only keep you from restoring operation as long as they are in system with defacto sovereigntyalso this isnt about the biggest fleet the enemy can come up with at 3am its a smallgang objective that only requires a smallgang defense
im going to head off this discussion and propose a different style of mechanic for the small gang objectivea system that has a cycle over a 24 hour period and truly requires more time of the day spent in a victory state than a defeat state to start inflicting damagemechanic isa structure that can maintain itself and has a limited capability to go into operational reinforced where it keeps running while reinforced this works against a buffer of capacitor in normal operation capacitor is stored in reinforced operation capacitor is dried up 24hours of capacitor if it is under reinforced for the majority of the day it will have a negative effective recharge and eventually go into real reinforcedthis would negate the 3am attack as long as you dont also fail to head off the 9am attack the 3pm attack and the 11pm attack
i think you guys just pinpointed an important issue there are three levels of disruption any attacker can inflict on a defender1 permanent  destroying their assets and replacing them with your own preventing resumption of defender activity2 interruption  disabling assets until they are repairedreplaced and defender activity resumes3 suppression  disabling assets until the attackers action stops defender activity immediately resumesthe difference between 2 and 3 are what youre getting atright now small gangs can do 3 by camping gatesstations preventing ratters and miners from doing their thing but if there are no ratters or miners they cant really make an impact that lasts beyond their departure from the areadisabling station services is meant to be a 2 what i think nande is looking for is more things along those lines especially in regards to passive income generationthe counterargument fahtim is making is that if the enemy can disable 2 anything that an alliance really cares about during an offpeak period then that alliance will feel compelled to protect their assets 237 lest they lose incomesovwhatever all night while people are sleepingbut if interruptiondisabling2 actions are restricted to things alliances dont care aboutwell whats the point and if sensitive assets can only be suppressed 3 and never interrupted 2 then the attacker has to camp those assets 237 to make an impact and so that is the impasseoff the top of my head one solution would be to engineer a time limit into any interruptions  the asset requires a certain amount of time for automated repair mechanisms to get itself back online so an insurgent attack on some asset would have an effect that lasts past the time they leave but not indefinitely until a defender returns to take some repair action then it is just a question of determining how long the downtime is following an attack like that
dont assume that youre dealing with a defender who plays for 115 hours and and an attacker who plays for 115 hoursassume youre dealing with a defender who plays for 8 hours attacker 1 who plays for 8 hours and attacker 2 who plays for 8 hours attackers 1 and 2 dont even know each other exist and dont intend to coordinate but between the two of them they can keep an objective down for 23 of the day outside of the defenders prime just because of how the timezones work outthis entire discussion is just kelsins stargate stuff rehashed the real solution is to have timezonebased servers just like every other mmo and be done with it so heres an approximation if you want a small gang fight go attack someone in your own timezone or get autoblueballed
yeah thats what it boils down to pve objectives should not be implemented to fill the timezonebased pvp gap
what is wrong with an objective being kept down when a defender is not around to defend it
because the common case is that a defender is not around to defend 23 of the time or more because they have to work eat  and sleep in addition to playing eve if a single attacker puts more time into the game than a single defender then they should be able to win out two unrelated attackers shouldnt compromise a defender due to a simple accident of timezones even if the crosstimezone is attack is by design its still not an even playing field because you cant get a buddy to defend your space for you with the same efficacy that you yourself could defend it due to pos shield passwords and such
alright in keeping with the whole defender should have an advantage angle of pos warfare switch the timers to 8hours uptime making up for 15 hours downtime8 hours on  15 hours off  systems are within limits to remain online in operational reinforced status where production doesnt skip a beatsurely youre not going to argue that a defender shouldnt have to maintain defacto sovereignty at any time
but what attacker can keep an objective down for 15 hours weve just established that in the common case theyre going to be playing in 8 hour blocks or lesswhat you are trying to do is imagine up a system for playing tugofwar where the two sides take turns pulling on the rope and at any point a random 3rd party can show up and pull the rope in either direction 1 its stupid and makes no sense its not really tugofwar anymore and 2 its not fun because you arent really interacting with your opponent youre just standing on a field pulling a rope around by yourself
so youre saying that it should be 13 hours instead i thought your previous example was a ridiculous exception and am glad youve pointed that out apologize for the argument baitingno its not trivial i can go attack your moon mining while youre off in timbuktu possibly my timbuktu and demand that you break off to go deal with a roaming threat in your home territory or sacrifice the moon paycheckso yes you are interacting very directly with your opponent by maintaining a constant presence in their space and forcing them to address your presence or face certain timezonebalanced doomin fact you can use these attacks as feints to draw the enemy away from your main objective or to stimulate the formation of a defensive gang and then hotdropping them at the gate into the system
youre kind missing my point but ive lost patience with explaining like i wrote above everything youre trying to do has been examined in kelsins old thread with the gatecapturing mechanic just go read that and save some electrons
youre talking about winninglosing territory im talking about suppression of assets like passive income i dont see anything wrong with attackers being able to suppress the passive income for instance moon mining of defenders at offhours of the defenderi think weve already established that small gangs arent going to be conquering territory what were talking about here is the function of small gangs in suppressing the security and profitability of territory held by the enemyedit the flaw in what you guys are bringing up here is that youre confusing destruction  conquering 1 with interruption or suppression 2  3
they both mean hurt the only difference is in the method and degree the issue of fairness for both attacker and defender applies regardless you dont get a free pass by saying yes its unfair but it only hurts a little and sometimes
nope youre points in kelsins old thread boil down to these1 sov changing should require commitment2 nothing should change hands because of ten guys who decide to go sit at a gate on a larkhowever 1 no sov is changing hands dejure sov will be under no contest in this mechanism2 the ten guys have to show up constantly and have to pack enough ammo to finish the job likely they will do it in multiple systems even more likely theyre doing it to lure you into forming gatecamps and spreading out in your own territory so they can attack you piecemeal this is anything but a random series of attacks
ive already established that a system will be balanced for timezones its therefore not unfair its easier to repair and hurts less that is the relationship not a trade of unfairness for less impact
this is the point that needs to be sorted ill go ahead and argue that it is not time zone unfair to have your passive income interrupted whether it is during your primetime or not and in fact this is exactly the objective small gangs should have  the disruption of fixed infrastructure passive income rather than assuming a territory holder is entitled to 24 hour passive income generation the income derived from something like moon mining can be based on how consistently secure an alliance can keep their infrastructure an alliance with good time zone coverage and security within their territory can maintain security and keep their passive income going for more of the time poor coverage or poor security reduces the incomeid like to hear arguments on that specific point
keslin im siding with fahtim and toman here if you can disrupt something with the first attack you can just attack over and over again in their offpeak hours it requires no real coordination you could just be passing through in your mauler and dodging pos guns for six hours while afkmore than one attack advantages to the defender the real purpose is to expose assets and force involvement in the home territory the disruption is a consequence for not accepting that challenge
so youre sure youre not just rehashing over the same ground then
its looking more and more to be the case that were going in circles i dont know what the problem is anymore ive taken all of the angles to provide concessions to the points of fahtim and toman and still failed to start reaching a concensusi set off with a lot of goals for improved sov one goal is to give sovereigns more benefits to holding sov in exchange for added exposure increase the value of space to compensate for the increased nonsovposscheduledfleetbattle vulnerabilitiesplease create a wishlist of everything you could have as a sovereign that would increase the value of 00 then we can talk about the proper level of exposure
again why assume that a defender who only logs in a portion of the day is entitled to passive income generation from fixed infrastructure during the time they are offline why not structure the system around generating income while you can protect an asset and having it lie dormant while you cannotby assuming entitlement to offline passive income like that you set yourself up for having to jump through crazy hoops to achieve timezone parity in an area that doesnt require itfor the sake of argument what if you tripled the current rate of income from moon mining but implemented something like what im describing a defender would only need to make sure their passive income isnt interfered with for 8 hours a day to equal their current income under this systembut that aside  good alliances have good time zone coverage and are rewarded by it  so i dont see the problem with needing good time zone coverage to get the most out of your moon mining operations in the face of insurgent attacks
heres my proposal for increased 00 richesterra mining platform  can be constructed at a rocky planet with sov harvests materials associated with rocky planets more income than a highend moon per planetgas mining platform  can be constructed on a gasgiant planet with sov harvests materials associated with gas giants more income than a highend moon per planeta layered system of timed processes that are escalated at each stage and happen across the span of several days negating timezone issues can eventually stop operations escalation here meaning that each stage requires more firepower to accomplish in a timely fashion ending at a subtypical tower knockdown gang at some intermediate step mining can be reduced to 50 and then 25 as the approach is made to a final assault disrupted production can be siphoned off to an extent
nande youre straying pretty far from the question posed in the thread titleif we can just stay big picture for a moment  the question is what should small gangs be able to accomplish i suggest that a good answer is  small gangs should be able to disable the moon mining operations of an enemy territory to inhibit their passive incometheres plenty of points around which to balance a straightforward idea like that  how much firepower it takes to do the job how long it takes how long it takes a defender to reonline a miner whether automated repair is possible whether disabling results in a total halt of income or only partial etcand it admirably fulfills all the requirements laid out in the op
im working on a full draft for a new structure if the idea flies we can use the same modifications for poss its in line with the total proposal for fixed sov and more meaningful 00 ownershipim going to work on a new model where there are degrees of production lost as phases of the disruption are left unchecked production isnt lost 100 until the whole platform is reinforced as if its going to get trashed after it comes outin between that phase and the initial harassment im going to propose several states of operational reinforcement that each come with a little bit more lost production and finally the capability to steal some producteach phase has more predictability scheduling for a fight and requires more firepower than the lastthis would be ideal in my opinion small gangs do small things large gangs do large things and everything in between happens in measured steps
i think this is definitely the direction to take this threadthe opposition is to erosion of 00 stabilityby raising the value of 00 erosion is avoided even as more exposure is added

well first id like to respond to the 24th sentence in this post by commenting that its not very well organized and that even though youve gotten the point already by now its kind of fun to troll a forum from time to time and anyway run on sentences are really hard to read and conjunctions and stuff take tie too many things together sometimes and posts that are really hard to read just get harder and harder to read and are you still with me sometimes i ramble on and on and on and on not to be too hard on you try to learn to use the bullet point lists and other organizational tools like underlining and italics to make it obvious which parts of the post we need to read and which parts are there to provide more detailscommentary i seriously just wrote this entire wall of text without thinking too much and just relying on a pretty fast typing ability cheers m8 good luck never ever ever again wall of text us to death omg ive discovered the cure for cancer but youll never find it in this huge post simply because its buried near the end of a wellreasoned set of rambling with no discernible organization how am i doing

sorry guys im not a forum  i spend more time in game actually doing things that most people just talk about on the forums but you are right sorry for the block of textoverall point fleet mechanics need to be adjusted
please include this topic under your fleet listissue fleet battle lag  give us back warfare on a massive scale
a new type of container for private pilots  the stats of a station container but without all the secuirty systems database clogging and the possibility to get rid of them when we move onissue insecure station containera very simple new item that make pilots lives simpler and even removes tons of unnecessary data being stored in the databases

supported sounds like a good idea
id support this as long as a player would get to set their characters skill level instead of just having every skill i know players use sisi for more than just looking for bugs if you had every skill youd have no way to really see how your build would work on tq
all issues agreed with bud and inc research and construction times i fully support as well
setting of skills is a nice idea as well would allow you to lower skills not just raise them and there are times where that would be of use for testing
this is a really nice idea and would go a long way with helping of the testing i approve
bah this proposal needs more visibility it is approvable
signedthe fittings could be saved on the client just like the overview settings are if server load is a problem ought to be exportableimportable as well so saving on clients wont be an issue people would soon find web sources with tons of stored fitting files this would also enable eft to integrate with this fit in eft then import then load huge usability improvement 
might be hard with eft but what about thisi fit out my ship click this button called lets say export fittings and it will be saved on your own client on your computer
againstadded nano nerf is killing solo warfare imo
against nano nerf as proposed because i am against blob warfare    and thought ccp was trying to work to discourage blob warfare  nor encourage itdid not ccp say they were working to move away from blob warfare
def against
in the middle of the nano nerf hype i hope you will find this refreshing idea worthy to show direction how to change the local in the futureprevious suggestions were based on ancient ideas like completely eliminate local channel or allow people leaving this channel these are bad in basic imho because intelligence should work on more levels than having or not havingshort introductionthe basic idea of neural networks is that whenever you your ship enter a new system your ship connects to an information hub located within the system which provides it with information about local a system can have multiple information hubs which can be maintained both by npc and by player organizations the kind of information available through these information hubs depends on the level of access the hub is providing to the pilot the level provided is standingdependent their subnetworks can be standingdependant and subscriptionbased too the maximum level of intel provided by player maintained networks is also might depend on the system sovenerity level of the entity providing the information possible hubs players can use in empire space the system holder faction is providing hub access to anyone who subscribes for this service and has high enough standings to access the hubs this means that the amarr the caldari the gallente and minmatar and also the pirate factions operate their own neural networks players may be able to connect to furthermore hiquality services can be accessed like the faction navies eg caldari navy subnetworks providing a better quality of service but also at a higher price in hisec concord is providing a free neural network as well which is available to anyone but criminals in 00 player corporations and alliances have to deploy their own hubs if they want to use them a neural network hub structure can be anchored to posses which provides information to the pilots who have access to it the quality of service depends on the subscribtion and the maximum qos achievable by hub structures is same with the souvenerity level of the system hubs located in sov 3 and sov 4 systems are much more accurate and detailed than those in sov 0 sov 1 and sov 2 the other way to get infromations in systems one does not have a friendly pos in is the use of role ships recons andor neural network probes recon ships may serve as a neural network hub and the level provided could depend on whether the ship is cloaked or not and skills ofc the probes are similar to scan probes they can be launched from probe launchers and provide some level of qos to all those who are in the same gangnetwork
concept details the neutal network is a concept where the main idea is to force the players to organise their local for themselfes the base idea is simple if you do nothing you wont receive any kind of intelligence about people present do for it is not as hard as it might sound at first equipments like system scanners at poses or proper scan probes or role ships can provide information on many levels about who is along with youthe many levels means four levels its not an accident that its the same number like the sovereignity levels have anchorable devices cant provide better quality of information level than the level of sov in the system recon ships and covert ops class frigates may provide intelligence on three levels 123 based on if the ship is cloaked or not or in case probes were used for the better quality what kind of them were gathering the informationin high sec systems people may use npc faction networks if their standings are good enough towards the given faction concord network should be also present and avaliable for everyone whose the security status is a non negative number lower personal sec status means an autokicksince its kind of impossible having good enough standings towards all npc factions there would be gaps in low sec by default which should be normal increasing the sight of a pilot might be avaliable by player networks in low sec also but not with the current sovereignity system if it would be possibe having major sov and minor sov in a system low sec could turn into paradise for a lot of people maintaining low sec networks and renting them for some isk could be a profession and ofc source of conflict anyways there is a big potential in this imhoit should be possible to join multiple networks at the same time joining a system where there are multiple networks present always means that player receives the best quality of information automatically networks sould be working both on alliance and corporation level this means joining the amarr network is nice but im sure by joining the imperial navys network might be better source in most cases just like the khanid network in in the khanid kingdom each faction has its main network joining its subnetworks faction member corps should be optional
in case of player network the situation is similar to npc networks if a corporationalliance founds a new network the first thing which has to be defined is the nain network node which is the default custom filtered node intel sources can be strained off by information type like poses onlyships onlyprobes only xy corp assets only or other restictions like max 1st and 2nd level only subnetworks which provides quicker better information can be reserved for true alliesmore iskin a system which is no mans land if there is no intel source present there should be no intel at all except about people on common networks im sure many people are concerned about the future of roaming gangs and stuff having a friendly recon ship in system solves the problem you wont fly blind as long as there is a covert opsrecon ship with you and on a common networkalso if this system comes live sending distress signals finally can come into game the main problem with distress signals in the current system is obvious if you are already in trouble you wont call in your enemies too if you are able to pick which networks should transmit the distress signal only your friends will receive your message the message in itself is not enough people on common network with the distress signal frequency also see the location as a warpable beaconto avoid fun with sending distress signals this should not be a free feature i guess 1m isk should be enough to make people bored with thiswith the neural network new type of agent missions can be implemented like travel to hostile territory probe some stuff kill some stuff rest like usual if you are still reading you must be really curious what are these levels exactly what kind of difference might be there well let me introduce my guessbasic 1 level1 minute delayshows friendlies in system by namedisplays whether unknown presence is in systemreports about ships entering  leaving the system names only for friendliesplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesstory is simple 1 neutralhostile guy left the system then later a friend who is on a same network like you has joined the system the refresh rate of this level is 1 minute or whatevermoderate 2 level30 secs delayshows friendles in system by nameshows local countreports about ships entering  leaving the system names only for friendliesplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesthe story here is simple too 1 neutralhostile left the system then 3 of them joined this level provides double speed refresh rate compated to the basic leveladvanced 3 levelno delayprovides list of both enemies and friends by nameshows both enemies and friends entering system by namecustomizable statistics like summariesplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesthis is what you could see on the third level its actually same with the current local except it is able to show who is joining and leaving the systemplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesand this is what local could be if players were able to customize the channel if high level intel is available im sure many people would not care joinsleaves for each random people if in a middle of a fleet battle and lag it would be cool if it would be easy to follow the odds all the timethe last one is the home level 4 which is about the same with the previous level but with intel about ship types also for each pilot
now you may ask what is the point why even touch local i brought this up because of id like to propose a better alternative than here has mentioned otherways its because you could be able to take advantage by getting better intel you could be able to blind your enemies by killing their intel source which could be fun in the middle of a fleet battle or home system you could sendreceive distress signals you could earn money by advertising and renting out your network people were forced to claim systems it would be an interest to populate 00 more than ever blind spots in space where anything can happen like in good old times recon ships would finally get the recon role imagine how many chinese farmers would die in the first week  alliances were able to decide who is getting free intel on local in their sovereign systems finally low sec could receive a nice boost guess other stuff toohere is about why i dont think all this would be a barrier for peopleand here are some thoughts about recon ships
yes
thats horriblewhy shouldnt i be able to recruit mercs to help me in a war i started why shouldnt i be able to just pay them to wardec someones alt corp etcseriously now what do you want with the changes the mercenary profession is quite fineseriously did any of you csm people hear about the its not broken dont break in on purpose its a simple concept to grasp
i like it
this is a really good idea it will actually make sense to put a bountey on someone after this but there is a small thing i see as a problem if you put a bountey on someone you expect himher to get killed and you dont care if the person that is going to do it has a high or a low standing with ird  you do however care if he does the job or notird standing has very litle to do with that  someone with low pvp experience can get lots of ird standing by just killing a ton of people via bountey contracts in jita  while a more expierenced pvper might go looking for that one big special badguy fly trough potentially dangerous space  to gather intel on his target and eventually pin him down and kill himnow who of these 2 people would you like to go after your 100 m bountey contract on the goonswarm ceo  pedit  i forgot the thumbs up

i think youre on the right track in as much as the bounty system needing a rework but this idea is just more rigid mechanics and cans and cants forced upon the game not supported sadly

your merc contracts thing sounds good on the surface but youre going to have wiseguy merc corps out there who accept contracts and then split the fee with the deccing corp to get the war lifted without firing a shot or losing a ship the net effect will be that the corp that got decced paid a ransom even though thats what they were trying to avoidmaking bounties into open contracts that anyone can accept wouldnt solve the issue of them being too easy to exploit here is a suggestion that i made cped from the features ideas section for your conveniencebounty hunting levelsworks basically the same as levels in missions as you progress in level youre allowed to go after progressively bigger targetslevel 1 up to 1000000 bountylevel 2 up to 10000000level 3 up to 100000000level 4 up to 1000000000level 5 unlimitedto achieve each level you need a certain number of confirmed kills with a passible kd ratiolevel 2 50 kills 60 kdlevel 3 250 kills 70 kdlevel 4 500 kills 80 kdlevel 5 1000 kills 90 kdthis does a couple of things it makes bounty hunting into a real profession that has a progression and some prestige to it and it makes it harder to exploit by the time you get to the upper levels you are a proven dedicated bounty hunter so someone who cheezes off a rich industrialist and gets a 1b bounty on his head wont be able to just have a random buddy of his pod him and split the bountybounty hunting locatorlet bounty hunters communicate with locator agents from space the higher you go in the profession the higher the level agent you can use higher level agents provide quicker answerssec status requirementyou have to get a concord license to go bounty hunting you obviously have to have a positive sec status criminal activity of any kind or associating with criminals ie being in the same corp trading with them or giving them money can cost you your license net effect is that you have to choose pirating or bounty hunting but not bothtarget requirementslicensed bounty hunters can collect bounties anywhere in space for those who eithera have a sec status under 20b belong to a corp that has been the aggressor in an empire war within the last 30 daysthis keeps civilians from being targeted and griefed with bountieslevel decay and resetto maintain your bounty hunter level you must maintain the kd ratio for that level and 10 of the required kills for that level per month failure to do so will bump you down to the next lower level bounty hunter level resets to 1 upon character transfer this keeps people high level pirates especially from buying and warehousing bounty hunter alts to use to collect the bounties on themselves it also requires that the player be a fairly dedicated bounty hunter to stay at the upper levels of the profession
i read the pdf file and like the ideasome points  bounties are looked at as way to cost the target thus a bounty contract is issued as described by a person with kill rights with several amounts1 total bounty to be paid out  this is the total isk value that will be paid out for this contract2 damage   this is a value between 20minimum and 80 maximum a bounty hunter accepts a contract finds and attacks the target of that bounty contract and destroys the ship the target is in 100 of the insurance value of that ship is multiplied by the damage  and paid to the bounty hunter from the total bounty if the target of the contract is podded the total cost of the replacement clone closest clone that covers the targets sp and any implants average market value  damage mod for implants is deducted from the total bounty and paid to the bounty hunter only the clone replacement cost is not modified by the damage  in the pay out process the bounty hunters are paid by their results and podding a naked clone pod is not all that impressivethe other thing that i remember was it seems that there was a limitation on who could accept the contract placed by the contractor and i disagree with that idea the bounty contract system should be blind put the contract out there and let the chips fall where they mayanother change would be the targets of bounties need to be visible  we currently can see a little skull icon on a pilot with a bounty on their head that icon should remain the amount of the bounty should not show just that that pilot has a bounty contract on their head
again this is the status quo you can do that asis i dont know many who do though  the random merc corp the decced hire has to be willing to pay off their enemy to avoid the fight most of them would rather just keep their commission and fight than lose half their money off the top this is why damagebased payouts are the correct way to do it theyre unexploitable we already have those bounty hunters dont need special locator agents they have the normal ones if you wanted to make a locator agent use range skill i could go for that but it should be for everybody so you want squeakyclean bounty hunters who arent even allowed to be in corp with someone at negative sec and if youve put in 1000 kills with a 90 ratio and you happen to buy ammo off someone at negative sec you lose all your experience thats not just stupid its completely insane and besides whats wrong with both bounty hunters are shady people its in the nature of the beast or you could use the present system where they go on people with negative sec status and whats wrong with griefing you focus far too much on preventing odd little corner cases and not enough on making the profession functional you require that someone who wants to be a topend bounty hunter has to kill better than three people per day in order to be able to collect big bounties thats nearly impossible  even if it wasnt for travel time and issues of when people are online there arent enough bounties in existence to maintain very many people at 5 and besides why does the person who put up the bounty care who collects it they want to cause pain not ensure that their hired killers live in a state of grace
ok i know this is old but i still want to support it  something i find ridiculas is that ccp charges the same amount for a month subscribtion in us s as in euros  so i pay 3499 euros a 2 months via subscribtion  while i pay in us dollars at gtc vendors saving me 12 euros

nefing again last update they sed they wernt going to nerf anything and now thay are
in favor of the general spirit of the motion but not fully behind the implementationi think i understand what youre getting at here but as has been said ad nauseum already the implementation leaves much to be desired the mission types youve suggested are already part of the everyday life so to speak of the major 00 entities goonswarm bob et al and to provide a source of income for this is rather pointless this is not to say however your idea is wholly without merit but you do fail to grasp the environment of nullsec space and it shows perhaps input from the other respected csms with said experience would solve this problemwith regards to playercreated missions no no no no no no nein nyet non a thousand times U03BFU03CDU03BD apart from the fact your average player frankly has all the creative ability of a slug the bureaucracy required to approve code and implement these missions would be mindboggling at best and completely ineffectual at worst there simply is no way to implement this idea efficiently without separating the wheat from the chaff so to speak you had me at npc vendors you dropped me on my head when you said mediators alliances dont need npc mediators many already have highranking members whose sole purpose is diplomacy failing that the big stick can always be waved and if necessary dropped on the head of your enemiesnote big stick can apply to capital ships titans or in the case of goonswarm blobs of t1 frigatesso what is to be done about 00 sec and agents with respect to itwell therein lies the problem as was stated previously deadspace complexes could help make 00 sec worth the trouble please note i am referring to the conquerable portion of nullsec not the haphazard npccontrolled parts which are little more than high sec with no rules agents can have a place in these areas but the implementation is rather tricky as has been noticed already logistics missions while an option are redundant as they are already a factor in maintaining poses ratting missions are redundant as are many of the missions available in high sec faction warfare brings up another problem as it can lead to members of a specific alliance fighting with other members simply by having a corp choose a different side this also has the unfortunate side effect of shoehorning members of said corps into fighting a war that is not necessarily beneficial to them what good does it do the average minmatar player to fight for the amarr lol speed nerf i dont presume to have answers to any of these questions since i am rather lacking in the subtle nuance of making money in zero sec myself hi delta squad but agents could be brought in theoretically speaking to help the average grunt pay for the carrier that he dreams about when getting popped in his tackling frigate pirate npcs could be an option hell even delegates of concord could be brought in offering missions to take out rats in belts and then transitioning to complexesall things considered your idea has merit but simply needs refinement as a goon i must say more propositions like this could lead to more faith in the csms as a whole since it proves that they arent simply concerned with making isk in highsecbut again consult the members who have experience in 00 this is imperative as only one who knows the mechanics can suggest improvementstldr sure why not
the more you talk the more i find that i dont like you because youre pretty cluelessgoonswarms moon mining pays for a large number of alliance level benefits in addition to upkeep this is the case for probably every other alliance that has nationalized moon mining were hardly exploited to fill the commands coffers im pretty sure our directors and ceo dont even get paid true storyso yeah while your enthusiasm is commendable your ignorance is not there is little more dangerous than a wellintentioned person with extremely limited infoi like how even in this day and age this stereotype carries on
probably because 80 of our fleets consist of t1 frigates duh
perhaps it is a goon poking fun at this stereotype iiam
federated ecumenical college of amarrian leaders yeah i could believe that
it just may be a goon posting
beats fighting over belts
ankh i should hate you for single handledy nerfing suicide ganking  but i wont and i think theres some leet ideas here one of the interesting ones is using ingame products as a simulated environment feed to make the inside of your station thrive this has a nice touch and eve does need a bit of a femininity here and there in essence theres a somewhat good idea bubbling under here not to be dismissed completely out of handi also think a person who hasnt flown in 00 has as much right to observe the behaviour and make a value call on what could add to it as anyone
because sieging a pos is a big dangerous task capital ships and battleships are expensiveand in 00 battleships are very hard to make available you simply dont do so without a competent fc and a well arranged fleet it isnt just a level 6 mission the fundamental problem of 00 is that l4 missions in highsec are as or more profitable controlling 00 space costs a lot of money and time really the only reason to live in 00 is ego as has been mentioned moon mining is generally used to keep the alliance afloat 00 logistics are crazy expensive fighting wars in 00 is insanely expensive in 00 ships get blown up a lot capital ships get blown up 00 isnt highsec 00 pvp isnt just another version of mission running nobody is in 00 for the money people who are out to get space rich stay in highsec where its safer and easier i dont care about getting rich i just make enough money to support myself
innominate is on the ball here i read over the details too fast regular missions in 00 would be a lot better in my opinionankh you may have a bit of a skewed image of 00 i cant blame you and im happy enough that you try to bring some sunshine in our rotten daily drag but some remarks are a bit inaccurate it should also be noted that any selfrespecting alliance has an open financial record to ceos and i dont know about other alliances but ours is legit an outpost costs roughly 25 bil a mothership costs 20 bil a titan costs 75 bil most titans arent exactly funded by the pilots themselvesoh and a typical round trip for a carrier costs roughly 10 mil theres a lot of capitals out there performing alliance work so theres a nice isk drain then theres alliancesupplied logistics ships dreads replacement programmes need i continue
i like the general idea as long as there are no npc missions in player owned stations only player made missions
why why no npc agents explain
so for example a ceo of alliance a creates a mission sayingdestroy the pos of alliance b in system y its orbiting planet w moon zwell pay 10 billion isk on completion split evenly between your fleet and an additional 100 million to the fleet commanderfleet commander a sees the mission thinks i can take this on and accepts the mission its then up to him to gather the fleet he thinks will be required for the task get them into position and flatten the pos while keeping the enemy fleets off his fleets backat least thats how im reading into ankhs idea
the short version an incredibly bad idea by someone that has never lived in 00 or even been in a player corp
because nobody would create such a mission the pos itself is its own reward thats the whole reasion why pos wars exist  poss are worth ten of billions for a good pos chain why would a player put up a mission to do something he would be doing anyway eg why would bob put up a mission to blow up poss in hostile stations and why would they do this for poss they would be blowing up anywayits like telling the criminal to rob a police stationalso your other comment about alliances not sharing thats perfectly true and the sad state of 00 atm most alliances in 00 are basically run by scammers and con men who keep all or most of the isk resources mining ops etc to themselves i mean why run contract scams when you can make a 50100man carebear corp to make you billions a week and give you respect rightso corp memebers are just slaves who rat and mine pvp corps at least usually share stuff so taking over that pos  hundreds of free ships thats why there is such a big gap of prosperity between the carebear member and the pvp member usuallyplayer made missions would not work people who want to kill a pos just do it or hire mercs to do it they do not need some complex npc system that nobody will use because you do not understand 00boost 00 npc regons with better missions that what we have currently npc 00 anybody can dock so there is risk there
me likee
excellent analysis whatand you were doing so well  yes no
when instead its easier and probably less costly for all involved for an alliance fc to just run the op to flatten said pos that he would have done with or without a mission to do it
chribba has my support cuz were both sweeds
hell yea
hi3 siege modei want to fit capital mining lasers on my dread and mine 300km aways
if the local was taken away it would be nice if the scanner could differentiate between unoccupied ships and active ones instead maybe you wouldnt even have the ship type on scanner but rather its size that could be more interesting but overall lets get rid of low sec and 00 local

that market would get so infested with people trying to scam good ones and bad ones that eventually noone would bother trying to fish out the credible ones from the scams specially when a couple of good scams kick in and people really loose isk and there will be a big scam that works people start to sell their  and everyone looses iskstock market in eve in its current form is just a bunch of roleplayers that want it to work because it looks nice if one values his time there are a 1000 better ways to make isk in eve with much less risk also about the risk i know buying stock in rl can be risky stocks go up and down and corporations go bankrupt however you never have to worry about the person taking all the shareholders money and  off at least very very very rarely since thats illegal if eve doesnt have that then eve wont have a successful stock market end of story
giving people better and more tangiable reasons for sticking to their chosen corporation would be a start how can anything be valued at all if the most valuable asset of all the pilots can and will up and leave at the slightest sense of an uphill journeybefore there are benefits to staying loyal to your corporation coded into the corporate interface the stockmarket need not be
there are corporations that have been around for years these would appear to be safe investments and not that hard to find also so what if everyone looses isk on a scam it would only be a problem if you are an idiot that has all of hisher investment capital in one place diversify it is easy to just lay out a blanket doomsday statement saying there will be too many scammers it cant work but how do we limit that possibility as much as possible as far as making money huge sums of money are made in the rl market i dont see why eve would necessarily be any different with a working stock marketim sorry for not understanding you wendat could you please explain how individual loyalty to a corporation has anything to do with stocks people quit working for corporations in rl all the time without affecting stock value
you are correct however that are not many of them and it would make a very dull stock market to only include the best of the best and even they could end up as a scam it has happened before and with much more isk floating in active stock market the chances of that happening would be higheras soon as people start loosing isk to scams even though they diversify your going to see people get ed off and go do something that is not 1020 chance of a scam then people stop trying sell their shares and the demand for shares goes down and everyone looses iskyes its very easy because thats how it ishuge sums of money are indeed made in the rl market because people dont fly away with your isk in spaceships people that try are normally put behind bars i know the idea of a working stock market is very cool indeed and i really would like to see it ingame because i really like it in rl but what im trying to say even though you can limit scaming to a absolute minium and buy shares all over the place to minimize the risk your still going to see scams theese scams will result in people not beliving in the market and it will never be what it could be with regulation
after reading every post in this thred and the amazing ideas that have been pointed out and suggestedi have always wondered the possibility of having a stock exchange in eve and being able to see the daily ups and downs of my stock i never really thought people would be so worried about scams since there are already several scams within eve as it is one of my corp members actually got approched by someone and that person just asked for isk he claimed he made 150 million isk a day doing itanywaysto the people who complainthis is straght forward if you dont like the idea dont play this portion of the game if it comes simple if i was going to invest isk into a corp or alliance i would do my research on them and see if they are a farud or not but nothing is ever garenteed not even your ship if you go thru a 05 systemi think it would be neat that if you buy shares it displays a lot of information from your purchase prince to how much you made per share and how many current people are looking to buy etcnow for those who are worried about fruad why not make a standardcorporations have to be at least 6 months old to make shares go public maybe have 5 different stock exchanges where you actually have to go to and register your corporation and in order to register your corp you have to have an active pos and maybe even print out the shares take them to the station and put them up for sale this way people can contract them aroundthere could be a currently employee requirement so weive out the 1 man corps not saying 1 person couldnt make a decent living doing it but it just protects the consumereve has a great market ships get blowen up and it keeps the isk flowing zylawy
dont get me wrong i really like the idea however if i were to choose from using my isk in shares that theres a high risk of being scammed aswell as the basic risk of buying stock i would choose another profession and when people see the light and realize that the market is just nice to look at and alot of the corps registered are possible scams why bother and about thoose standards there going to have be way higher than that 
currently the only way to make more money in 00 is through drone region ratting or moon mining level four missions shouldnt be this rewarding and should be adjusted
this is me many weeks and i live full time in 00  its perfectly viable to be a casual player down here my impression is that a lot of highseconly players have an unrealistic idea of the time commitment required to play in 00 while some alliances may require more commitment there are also opportunities for casual playone of the biggest obstacles for casuals in nullsec is simply a matter of education its pretty easy to avoid undesirable engagements in eve once youve learned how but unfortunately thats not something they put in the tutorialsmaybe we need a burn back to the gate tutorial along with a fit a cloak tutorial and a watch intel channels tutorial
hahahahahahahahahah let me set you straight no missions in 00empire suckshave you ever got a faction or officer spawn i have and i can tell you 90 of faction spawns are worthless wooo ammo and a tag awesomeofficer spawns are even more of a joke since ive lived in 00 for a year and havent seen 1 someone got one in the system i rat in the other day and it was worth maybe 100mil hahahah moon mining is done on an alliance level00 is the end game theres no reason people living in a newbie area should be making as much as pilots in 00 space who have fought and paid for that space
something needs to be done the sad fact remains that highsec is far more profitable than large swaths of 00 either highsec needs to be nerfed or lowsec00 needs more boosts
i dont understand these people who think that warping into low sec is an immediate death sentence as long as you are at the keyboard playing the game its not that bad sometimes you might die with no chance to avoid it but most of the time i dont see anyone else pirate or otherwiseedit i dont support putting the lvl 4s into 00 but putting 3s and 4s into lowsec sounds fair
hells yeah

first question first you dont know how to farm level 4 missions good too many people know how to alreadysecond question no if you spend all day running missions with your character more power to you i have been known to run lvl 4s for 814 hours straight on my days off as a way to build up capital for my other in game activitiestruth be told the only play styles that i have a problem with are macroers and farmers other than them let everybody enjoy the wonder that is eve the way they want to i sayi just wish more players felt the way i do and would quit clogging up the forums with take away from them and give to me threadsseriously though cheers to you and i am glad you enjoy your activities in eve just the way they arepeaceps no support for the op again
i was in 00 in the first week of playing i borrowed some money bought an osprey and mined in su of syndicate other people could join and go into 00 syndicate actually had agents so i could do missions their and with a support group of my corp i thrived people can do that if they want to sure it was hard at times but knowing i was in level three missions before the trial was out and having tackled people who tried to kill myself and others it was a hole lot better than the previous time i had tried the game and had nothing 00 is a great place for newbies and allows you to learn how to fit ships well learn to watch local and how to pvp in frigates that cost you nothing to lose
no supportfirst the op talks about wanting to balance income and then talks about changes as illconcieved and poorly planned out as the ccp speed nerfyeah whateverback to my policy of ignoring goonathreads
level 4s only being in 00 is too extreme level 5s only in 00 yes but 4s should stay in low sec and all other levels in high sec
high sec can have the level fives really i mean if you have to kill an npc cap ship in high sec go for it it would even bring you guys together but the lvl 4 missions make more isk reliably than just about anything the average person can make in 00 or low sec for the riskreward
average and i mean average not top reward for missions is 20 million hour a raven cost 80 millions so that is 4 hours of playaverage reward ratting in 00 is in the 3040 million range including the not so rare faction spawns every one of them rise the average a lot if you want you can rat in 00 as long as you can run missions in high sec with very little additional risk so there is a decent balance naturally if you go for the with 2 accounts and uber faction set up i can do 60 millionhour posts you should balance that with the in my 100 true security system i get 120 millions hour plus faction spawns and officers posts
level 4 mission in 00 forgetting themratting in almost all regions
all i see is a naked attempt by the op to try and force veteran players to live the same way he does in gamewell i say to hell with thatyou like living out in nolow sec awesome stay out there be happy and stop trying to ruin the game for vets who like living in empire somemost of the timewhat the hell do you have to complain about anyway you think level 3s and 4s are such awesome money makers great go run them yourself its not like their arent higher quality agents out in lowno sec that pay out a lot more in direct isk loot and better missions than their counterparts in high sec right now already in game so how is that not balanced with that balance already in place in game where is this mythical problem you are trying to dream up i dont buy this in the least the balance is fine the way it is no support 
could high sec riskrewardtime balance be looked at and possibly adjusted absolutelyalthoughwith so much mission money pouring into the game at nigh catastrophic levels youd think that prices would be inflating faster then the blow up altar boy doll in the priests bedroomyet somehow this disastrous inflation that would logically be the result of mega millionsbillionstrillions being farmed 237365 doesnt seem to be happeningso maybe its not as big of a problem as the people whining seem to thinki think the reason why price of many things is actually going down over time despite of more and more isk entering circulation is simply because thereUFFFDs even more mineralsmodules and such entering as well asset inflation beating isk inflation most items are well supplied to the market and to make inventory move sellers have to compete ferociously with prices itUFFFDs easy to see from battleship prices for examplet2 doesnUFFFDt have quite same pattern due to building material production being far more limited which puts effective floor on prices
op talks about risk v rewarddude your alliance mates tampered with the client and because it was undetectable forced ccp to give everyone the same feature result a safer eveyour alliance mates ganked  loads of hulks and coveters and got the insurance system nerfed result a safer eveof course i can see how an alliance with huge swathes of space to rent out would be interested in attracting more people to 00especially as your alliance charges people a further 20 to play the game with themis a good troll though
hey keep your level iv mission runners and their lagg away from 00 space 
you can rat for days and weeks and not see a single faction spawn bringing them into the equation is stupid your payout for ratting is being generous as well if the belts have been pruned and there are some good chains set up then we can make 20mil an hour of course thats if you arent sharing the system with 5 other people which you usually do the 3040 mil range is what you get if you hit a faction spawn in order to make 3040mil an hour in 00 you have to kill 22 of the highest value rats at 18mil how often do you think that happens youre lucky to see one triple 18mil bs spawn in a system of 22 belts get out

look someone who makes his isk off level 4s in the safety of 10 space
figures a goonie would bring this up one moremission runners support eveonline with out them you would be forced to go back to wow to gank newbieswhy cant you let people play the way they want to why force them to play with you empire players are playing their game not yours want to see eveonline diethis is the way
what is this riskreward you speak of lag camps dont have risksuicide ganks dont have riskganking newbs dont have riski got a better idea istead of driving the players away lets convert eveonline to wow is space so after level 70 all you have to do is kill each other off with no harmful effectsstupid goonjust stupid
yeah no support here eitherpoorly thought out short sighted and well just not a good ideaplease see the 1000000 other threads about this very same topic
then since you guys dislike this idea so much how about just allowing agents in outposts
strange i get them pretty often and not bringing them in the equation is stupid my current average with faction spawn is 60 millions in 042 sec space without the faction spawn is 25 notice the difference of including them still convinced that not including them is the right way to calculate the returns of ratting
calling shenanigans even assuming every one dropped a 175m item thats an average of one faction spawn every 5 hours unless there are some serious imbalances between a 07 in angel rat space where ive had 2 in about 80 hours of ratting im forced to conclude that your post is an outright fabrication
he might just be lucky neither your or his subjective experience carry special validity
ive been playing eve for many years i just now started running missions againwhy i needed cash i didnt need to fight sombody in a ratting ship against a pvp ship so i moved back into empire and ran three level four missions32 million isk took me from 9am to 3pm i do them solowhere the harm in that6 hours of my life used to earn 32 million isk rewardi made 3 times the amount i would have in a system by my self with 12 belts in it 10 million 8 hours playriskwell comming out of warp into a trapfunny ccp real frecking funny some salvage pirate comming into my fieldor some lame can tipperdid i mention having to run to a station to recharge my cap several times last nightno there isnt anything wrong with what i did yesterday the risk i was taking equals the reward i recieved
no you just do not know how to run missions or know what missions to turn down and go on to the next one
le sigh1 hisec isk printing aka level 4 misisons have not always existed in this form so no they arent necessary2 they cant play the way they want to because in eve what one person does affects others in this case the availability of level 4 missions makes pvp in lowsec00 useless because you cant inflict any financial losses on your opponent any losses can be made up by missioning in hisec and theres nothing to fight over because you can get the same thing missioning in hisec
wts economics 101 skillbook  only 1 billion isk l4 missions produce both lots of isk and lots of modulesminerals these generally tend to counteract eachother when it comes to inflation but that does not mean that l4 highsec missions are not getting farmed or that they are good for the economy the nano nerf wouldnt be needed if t2 ships and modules were more expensive but thanks to the general availability of quick easy isk in highsec everyone and their mother can afford a pimped out vagabond
this is the biggest problem i have with the current mission setup its tough to fight meaningful battles over territory when both sides are just replacing losses with out of corp mission alts  and they dont care about the territory anyway because hey missions are better
hey im a carebear would i be more tolerable to a pvper only because i moved out to lowsec
it has nothing to do with you being in lowsec or hisec it has everything to do with rewards in hisec vs rewards in lowsecand people need to stop making this into a war of pvers vs pvpers its not about that its about risk vs reward and making conflict in lowsec00 meaningful
i can totally agree with this i being one of these l4 mission running carebears think1 level 4 missions are too easy after a while mostly because they are too predictable this makes them too farmable2 level 4 missions pay out too much esp in drops the item drops also disrupt the market and make it the new mining by refining modules some of this could also be said for level 3 missions3 life in low sec and 00 is probably not rewarding enough compared to mission farming4 pve fittings and combat are too different from pvp fittings and combat to give mission runners enough of a fighting chance in low sec i fully agree these issues should be fixed but not in the way that is proposed fix them so that mission running is still a viable career  missions are less farmable but more enjoyable and educational by making it more dynamic and allow more pvplike fittings and strategies  carebearism isnt punished income oppertunities across the various regions of space increase according to risk
try searching for encounter sites while you rat it increase the faction spawn found and yes you are spot on currently i am at 1 faction every 5 hours but as i have probably had serious luck i have halved the result to 3040 mill as in the first post about return rattingedit more like 1 faction every 4 hours for that result that is why i have spoken about 3040 million average and not 60
really really crappy idea1 00 power blocs are already too rich dont need to get richerso tell me again why 00 alliances who can already field gamebreaking cap fleets and fighter swarms that block out the sun and can replace them like theyre t1 frigs need more static resources to farmthe economics of t2 production since the introduction of invention has already made 00 way too rich for its own good it doesnt need to get richer2 its a freaking gamethere are already more rewards to be had in 00 there are already level 4 agents in 00 and theyre higher quality than the agents in empire the people who arent going after them simply dont want to theyre content to play their pve game in empire most of them are casualoccasional players who dont have time for grandious alliance goals and politics they just want to pay their 1495 and log on and shoot some npc rats when they want towhen goonswarm starts paying the bills around here i will fully support your right to tell them that their 1495 isnt welcome anymore till then how about you play your game and let them play theirs i know that youre butthurt that its about to get harder to grief some segment of the eve population to make yourself feel cool and important and get your lulz but hey get over it 3 there is and ought to be room in this game for individualsyanno some folks just like to think outside the er hivemind no pun intended your proposal is basically to turn empire into a starter island that nobody would stay in after their trial account expires most mmos are that way eve isnt most mmos have separate pve only servers eve doesnt welcome to eveim sure youd like eve to be a different game you know just for lulz dont think its happening bud there are going to be folks who happily play this game that you cant grief its a sad tale of woe to be sure but im sure youll livei do love how youve redecorated 00 though look at it this way if you cant lure empire players to 00 by turning it into powerbloccumnapland forcing them to come isnt going to work youll just push them out of the game and fortunately that isnt your call im willing to bet that this time next year their 1495 will still be as welcome as it is now
1 its not about making 00 more profitable but hisec less profitable also being in 00 besides 00 is not more profitable when you factor in the timeeffort needed to defend that space2 eve is a game where when you do something it always affects someone else being able to print isk in hisec dumbs down pvp in eve because you cannot inflict meaningful financial losses on your opponent because no matter how much space they lose they can always make a lot of isk in a short time by farming isk in hisec3 ermit is this does not mean youll be successful just ignoring everyone else it is an mmo but it doesnt mean you need to join a corp hell even with the changes it wouldnt mean you need to join a corp it would just make it easier to survive as it should be
thats the one reason i started this the loss of asset doesnt reallybother me its the time you can easily waste 2030 minutes of time on a disconnecti like the idea someone else had of assign it to a shipid rather then a session id that would solve the problem

supportedalso supported
support i almost didnt read the thread though because the title led me to believe that this belonged on the intergalactic summit forum i propose to have it changed to add option to free slaves
i was thinking of a more complicated system for the freeing of slaveseach group from tourists to slaves should be freeable each would have a set of variables associated with them likelihood of success gratitude and cost of setting free a tourist wouldnt have much gratitude but would have a higher rate of success and would cost almost nothing to set free a slave would have much gratitude but would not have high rate of success and would be expensive to set free it should be possible but not likely that a freed slave ends up being a ceo of a top corp and gives you many iskies because they were highly appreciativeafter setting the slaves free  maybe a week or two later you receive an evemail from the livestock that burns me a bit too saying what has happened to them and possibly including some iskies
i like this option of turning slaves to freed slaves as well as the option to somehow disable drugs and turn them in and turning exotic dancers and janitors into slaves and so onof course once changed changing something back should be impossible or smuggling will run rampant
i recently raised a petition for salvage drones after all we have all sorts of other drones it make no sense that you have to haul a big ship everywhere or tractor everything  the tractor beams and salvage mods take up valuable slots also having sds would mean you could salvage whilst you fighti got the response below and am therefore doing as advisedhithis sounds like a pretty good ideai suggest that you post about the new idea for optimizing and improving the game in the features and ideas discussion section of our official forumsthe dev team regularly reads it and takes feedback into consideration while working their hardest to improve the gamehere is a direct link to the section
just a minor point posting gm correspondence isnt allowed on the forumhaving said that its not a bad idea though i would personally prefer to see tug drones implemented ie drones thatll fly out to a wreck and pull the whole thing back to within 1500m of your ship from lootingsalvaging purposesthey would need to be reasonably fast on the outbound trip being slowed down by the mass of whatever theyre towing on the return trip explanation for this would be that it needs to be a flying powerful engine in order to be able to move the mass of a wreckso theyd probably return a frigate wreck at around the same rate as a standard tractor beam while a battleship wreck would take more time to pull inof course to pull in wrecks faster all you would need to do is dedicate multiple drones per wreck to offset the massthe problem with salvaging at that range would be the size of cargo hold a drone would need in order to be able to salvage any wreck it gets totenative support therefore i like the idea however it would need careful consideration as to drone volumebandwidthcargo hold size it would also need to be done in such a way that these drones could only salvagetractor a wreck that you your corp or your fleet created
ive been wondering about this for a while  suspect it may be a little too close to easy mode gaming though 1 even so
this is a horrible idea there should not be drones for everything otherwise we will make drone ships capable of doing everything imaginable tractoring and salvaging wrecks should take up a high slot that could otherwise be used on weapons
thanks i didnt see a downside for anyone when i made this proposal but its still a little surprising there hasnt been some sort of dissent pleasantly surprising thoughbest regardswindjammer
any love for drones is good
i wouldnt support this idea even if ccp made it quicker to setup and tear down poses as well as scan moons currently there are about 24k moons in a region and i recently scanned over 1300 of them in one of our regions this took over 40 hours of nonstop scanning this idea is horrible and you should stop posting
there are location and number of moons
no
yes lets continue to punish 00 alliances for being successful at holding valuable regions and vast amounts of stations lets force them to preform tedious procedures in order to maintain themselves while the groups in empire do nothing but run level 4 missions in 10 security space with no riskthis movement would also directly influence you jade as the reduced high end moon pool to draw from would result in inreased t2 costs and t2 margins i dont appreciate your abuse of your position to further your wallet moon mining as it stands is fine what needs to be addressed is the breakdown and distribution of the resources requiring moon materials that says that instead of 1000 units of low ends and 500 of the high you require 4000 of the low and 250 of the high making the low more valuable and the highs less this would be a far larger and more beneficial step for moon mining than any random distribution of moons which change from time to time additionally i would encourge that the high end moons be redistributed right now well over half of eves high ends are contained within three regions and thats just bloody ed i speak of course of paragon soul feythabolis and delve
i would remove the mining from the moons and introduce asteroids that can be mined not the roids found in belts btw these asteroids are spawned random in eve and need to be probed to be foundthe asteriod has a certain ammount of stuff that can be mined untill it is depleted and gone the asteroid itself has also a timer its on the move for role playing sake   so if the timer is up the roid is gone also wether all materials are mined or notin order to mine the asteroid you have a special mining structure that can be launched once and is destroyed when the roid is gone it is possible to get it back but it needs to be retrieved while the roid is still therei really think that moons should be only used for sov and not for mining one problem though the system i thought of will not triger wars more often but it does trigger a need for space because holding more space means getting higher chance that a roid will spawn inside the alliance space
maybe just dynamic moons within constellations like 8109101010 plexes
i think youre just looking for more ways to screw over the 00 alliances that you cant actually bully around like you do empire corps this is just along the same vein as your destructible outposts suggestions
bluntly speaking there is not a single aspect of this suggestion that is not absolutely terrible sorry if it comes off as a troll because its not but really this is all just bad as bad can be when flying around in a mothership full of groon fightersi think part of the problem is that much of the people here think that moon mining is some magical isk fountain where profit flows like rivers of honey maybe one of the logistics people could give them an idea of the typical cost just a suggestionim all for redistribution of wealth but to just randomly move the already spawned moons this just shows how laughably unqualified you are jade as a csm and even more so as the head of such a group if you want this to be taken even remotely seriously you should stop treating it like some well magical isk fountain
i love scanning moons its wonderful how it takes hours to find out whats in a system usually nothing valuable and to collate this and work out where you can make money without going insane from the logistics now i get to rescan space because jade would have moons move around at random hoorayeven more fun is anchoring poses right click anchor wait 5 minutes right click online wait 5 minutes repeat for 40 modules now i get to spend even more of my play time staring at a little bar counting down to 0 brilliant this is just what i wanted to do to help keep my alliance afloat this is a wonderful wellthought out idea from a sensible and notatall biased csm rep who isnt acting in his own interest
its a pain in the ass to set up a pos we already hate posswait until after starbase logistics is needlessly souldestroying has been addressed before making moon minerals migrate around
thiswith the current pos mechanics if moons functioned as jade proposes the prices of moon minerals and the subsequent materials and components would sky rocket as the time spent finding moons and deploying mining operations would rise exponentially
i propose letting goonswarm have 100 influence over what gets done in 00 because they obviously are the only ones who know anything about it and all of you other carebears should just leave well enough alone
why not have moons run out of minerals and then eventually restock over timemuch like a respawning asteroidsyeah i know random idea but im curious as to the responsemigrating moon minerals is a bit of a pain especially from the programing aspect the algorithms involved would blow your brains out lets not make ccps job any harder better yet lower the rate at which you gain income from themand cause the balance to shift more in favor of mining rocksice that would help a biti dont get why theres only 1 oretype mined from any one moonplanet why not have a combination of things and then be required to purchase specific modules of various qualities or require various skills to mine that specific type or types of orethere are various strengths of asteroids right why not have the same typea planetmoon in reality would not have a single quality of ore or ice but many kinds of various yieldsrandom thought at best i know certainly better than migrating moons yuck
i agree with 1 2 4 5 and 8 but would like to add that i believe the mission sensitive items need to be locked so ppl cant fly in and steal them trashing your hard earned faction standings because you cant finish the mission and have to fail it
a reasonable discussion of high sec level 4 riskrewardi can give the idea in general a thumbs upespecially when compared to the other issue threadi dont agree with every pointand dont really feel much change is needed but ive got no problem with the subject being looked at and adjusted if ccp feels it is necessary
issuethe only containers available that are large and cheap for us to sort all the junk in our hangars are station containers unfortunately they are all audit logged they cant be deleted for a long time after use and in the meantime they not only clog the database with their presence they also contain huge logs this may not affect the servers much but it surely does them no good at the same time those of us that switch stations now and then leave a trail of cans clogging our assets windows i wouldnt be surprised if theres several million unused station containers in eve  and just as many in use  that dont need the security and logssolutiongive us a plain container large thats all its a very simple item to add and probably wont take a dev more than 10 minutes to do  though seeding the sales on all stations will probably take a bit longeritemname insecure station containercapacity like a station containervolume like a station containermass like a station containersecurity none no audit no password no logs no nothingsimple isnt it

the cross faction battleships are great especially the nightmare but were lacking 2 major battleship crosses that would also be great ships gallenteamarr and caldariminmatarim especially interested in the latter im a caldari pilot it makes sense to crosstrain with minmatar as i can take advantage of my missile and shield skills but when i get the skills up there is no payoff with a cross faction battleship which is a real shame as id love to have a caldariminmatar bs to aim for
toss in another amarrcaldari one while youre at it so that every faction gets 4 i like this in principle but the fluff really doesnt finding another 23 factions to give ships to is not easy with as few combatoriented npc factions as exist right now also i just want to see the two you listed getting 5 resists per level off the amcal skill and 75 rep per level off the mingal skill its probably not sane but itd be funny
i hear that this is something that is in the works thukker soe ammatar intaki syndicate ships etcin development old chap however it would be helpful if you suggest a good idea of what they could be like p ie more than skillset required
it seems to easy for a group of individuals to warp into someones mission and take the completion items then they attemp to ransom the items back missioners can spend a long time building their faction standings and put a lot of effort into them just to have someone steal a damsel or such item the hit we recieve towards are standing both faction and corp are heavy and in all honesty any loser can warp in and steal these items i think we should have mission sensitive items only grabbable by the missioner or theft resulting in a loss towards the theifs concord standing or the standing towards the missions corp after all they are infringing upon that corp why should the agent hate the guy that lost the mission he should hate the guy that stole the item anyways i think ccp should do something about this cause losing faction standing sucks cause it is hard to get back
most missionsensitive items are dropped in wrecks if im not mistaken you have the right to kill people who loot your wreck failing that when you see someone enter your mission zone that you dont know just warp out and all the aggression will fall on them a lot of thieves fly ships that cant handle that especially with the massive cpu pinch of a scan probe launcher also worstcase cant you just come back the next day once the mission has respawned and do it again to grab the damsel again its never happened to me but that should be possible from what i can tell either that or just pay them off or accept the standings hit youve been had live with it this really doesnt seem like an issue
pettition it it used to be not allowed dunno if thats still the case or not
not sure about this  mission completion occurs when you kill the main guy and cause the needed item to dropspawn not when you pick it up there is the window of opportunity to steal it if a thief is in the right place at the right timehowever i am a dedicated mission runner myself and any possible solution to this seems a little too carebear there should always be some risk in eve  and one of the risks associated with running missions is that if youre unlucky your mission drop will be nicked and you run the risk of having to displease your agent as hershey says if they pinch it kill em it might not make it through the wreck but 50 chance is better than none not to mention the satisfaction 
petitioning it doesnt work and you cant reset it thats what the gms say and saying hey youve been had i dont know when 1 frig warps in and theres 6 bses at the station waiting to gank you for firing on their buddy eh i honestly dont think it should be allowed
you have kill rights kill them this is no different from then stealing loot
who cares if theres a dozen titans waiting at the station for you he stole so your corp gets kill rights on him you shot him so he gets kill rights on youto defend himself but his corp does not get kill rights let the battleships attack  itll be absolutely hilarious to hear their crying in local when concord kills the lot of them
have not been boosted for years however ships hp resists and most other things haveas it stands a player can tank them in almost most ship classes so they useless tbhis there a chance we could get these boosted  or even looked at
i find it humorous to the people who think this would make 00 space worthlessremoval of insurance would make a couple things very apparentthe value of your ship is now much greateryou have to stop and consider whether your egopride is worth more than your shipmakes corporations weigh whether its cost effective to attack someone making it more of a challenge as opposed to just an another slug festwars dont have insurance thats what makes war nastycourse i dont like the prospect of losing a multimillion isk investment like an freighter or something or a battlecruiserwould put an end to the morons who can think they can just go off and do whatever they want realizing they have to buy there ships back without any payoutsworthless only if your griping about not having the ability to pvp 247 make it much harder yes but not impossible would be an intriguing challenge hardly worthless would make it more valuable even as in your ship outlasting the challenges thrown at itid miss the insurance but at least it makes pvp fights and attacks much more accurate to the true value of what takes place like the fact you cant just replace your ship at the drop of a hat without paying even more money to achieve the same goala standoff suddenly becomes a question of whose a better steward of ones cashsure it wont be pretty but it would take a lot of the fun out of people who dont care about money anymore most of us dont have that kind of money anyway that gives them pause and i like that o signed none and tweeking for different insurance methods for sure
the entire premise of this proposal is flawedinsurance is not there to be realistic in any way shape or formit is there to take the bite off of ship losesadding realism is not a factor when designing game mechanicsrealism is used as a means to justify game mechanics after the factthe developers didnt start with the idea hey we should allow players to buy insurance for their ships how should that insurance workthey started with the idea hey we should give some isk back to a player when they lose there ships so they arent totally screwed now what realistic reason can we use to justify giving them that isktry designing your idea with the game mechanic in mind then try to make it realistic by adding fluff around ityour attempt to start with what is realistic and develop game mechanics from there will failplease visit your user settings to reenable images
i appreciate what youve said and i agree however let us not ignore the state of the game  many people wanted a solution to capital ships onlineim sure im not alone in hoping to one day see more combat taking place in smaller ships eg cruiser warfare and allwouldnt youi admit that this idea would perhaps give titans a bit too much of an edge howeverscagga
so why the garbage about making insurance more reaslisticif you think that insurance payouts should be decreased to encourage people to fly smaller ships then bloody well say sothat is a far more reasonable proposal i am not sure if i support it or not but atleast you would be stating a valid reason for changing insurancewith the goal clearly stated you might get some reasonable ideas on how to acheive that you can worry about making it sound reaslistic later
bad ideayou will make pvp so incredibly costly its realistic but it would not be good for the gameplay lets fase it  the last thing we want is an insurence system like that irl  everyone hates that  thas why they made insurence in eve so win in the first place 
amen scagga much better than removing it i like
the garbage indeed what i put there was more of an afterthought the feedback you gave led me to reconsider the idea and thats what came out now for more feedback
yes it makes pvp more costly  especially if youre good at losing stuff often everyone would feel the brunt of it  including myself but lets think of the results shall we will it really be bad for gameplay if the result is fewer capblobs and more smallship warfare perhaps it issometimes improvements are painful
your system favors those who lose ships less oftentherefore those who form up capital ship blobs to minimize their loses will receive better insurance coverage than those roaming small gangs who frequantly lose shipsyou might want to rethink your entire mechanic given your stated objective is to encourage the use of small roaming gangs instead of large capital blobs
scaggas 2stroke 35bhp brain putts along merrily while it works out a possible solution to this uphill taskwas that the wind changing direction damn
i think the only way to make insurance truly realistic and effective is to turn it over to the players why not allow playersplayer corps to sell insurance coverage yet another miniprofession created and who knows what other miniprofessions players will create around it
well said i look forward to seeing a new proposal
i got podkilled yesterday in a 08 system while flying in a pod between to systems relocating shipswhat i dont understand is that i am not getting any kill rights against the other player ive lost 80mil isk in implants and i have no recourse on the bastard whatsoeveri petitioned it to ccp but they saybesides there is no kill right issues for a pod kill as intended i apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you and wish you a speedy recovery thanks a bunch how is this fair
so you where suicide pod killed or did you agro the killer firstif someone upped and podded you for the pure pleasure of just killing you and they got concorded then i would support this but if you stole a heap of ore and they attacked you in your pod then i would have to say i support ccp
nope i was on autopilot between two systems simply flying back to pick up another shipi came back and found myself sitting in a clone vat with all my 4 implants gonethe main thing is this happened in a 08 system on route and the route was entirely in highsec
the issue is pretty simple herea player shot at you was probably concorded for doing so and that should get you kill rights it doesnt matter what youre in if you lose your current transportation ship even a pod you should get kill rightssupported as long as you where not part of a war dec faction wars or had agro on someone
please do not post private correspondences with ccp staff on the forums saint
and no we are neither at war nor had the other player kill rights or anything
my guess is that its an intended feature
i find it dificult to give you support considering you where using autopilotif you where not using autopilot you would have likely not been killed as warping to 0 meters to your gate of choice would allow you to quickly escapei do have issue with the fact that you didnt get kill rights id think you would considering what took place but then you have yet to confirm if concord took said player out after all it is high secand if you where autopiloting your likely to have been killed at a stargate and concord camps those frequentlyid say someone was either really stupid or just really mad at you but it goes back to the first rule i learned when i started playing this gameyou dont autopilot unless your willing to risk your skin
this really isnt a proposal and does not belong in the assmebly hall portion of the forumsin the situation you describe you get kill rights examine the wording of your petition for flaws in the information it contains if you find a flaw repetition if you find no flaw file a petition against the gm who first responded this will escalate the matter to a more senior member of the gm team for reviewwindjammer
i believe that i will go podhunting in a cheap ship thanks for the ideawindjammer
dont undock with implants you cant afford to lose
i wish people would read hes not ing and moaning that he got podded on autopilot ffs he thinks he should get killrights on the aggressor and i dont see any reason why he shouldntsupported
the reason i am posting this here is related to the response i got from the gm which i am not allowed to quote it seemsthe main point is that the gm described this as an intended result meaning me not getting kill rights after a pod kill however everyone i am telling this to thinks this doesnt make sense and it madif this is indeed as intended by ccp then this is something that needs to be changed hence the reason i am turning to the csm
yeah im down with more communication
time saving ftw eh
mehnuclear weapons are overpowered aswell its just one of the things thats meant to be there for a deterrentdd scares enemy fleets from hanging around people trying to survive a couple shots setup their ships for it i think its fine as is except maybe a couple dozen too many titans
i hear you got kicked 
couple of ideas i posted elsewhereturret batteriesthese fit only on a titan they come in a few flavorssmall weapon battery holds 16 small guns or launchersmedium weapon battery holds 8 medium guns or launcherslarge weapon battery holds 4 large guns or launchersxl weapon battery holds 2 xl guns or launchersthis would let you fit a titan to be a support killer or a cap killer and get it in the middle of the fight instead of sitting behind a pos shield waiting to do its tricktitan cant dd through its own shieldit changes the dd to a weapon that can only be used under fire when the ship is taking some significant damagewhat we want to do is get these ships into the fight instead of having them be an extremely conservatively played one trick pony it was fine to have them played so conservatively when there were less than a hand full of them in game by the time we get up to 50 or more of them roaming round theyre going to become a problem and will ultimately have to be nerfed and that would be a shame better to change them so that they get played agressively and lost a little more oftendown side to this of course is lag its bad enough to lose a carrier dread or mom to lag losing titans to lag would redefine the meaning of sucks
nobecause you included refining and trading as possible alternatives you have essentially proposed the the ability to buy standings it would be too easy for a rich and established player to create alts with high standings of every single faction he could dream of with your proposal
why shouldnt you be able to buy faction standing not a troll serious question as to why this particular concept would break the game
yeah good point as it is the main purpose of standings is for cheaper brokers better refining and jump clones if they had to buy standing theyd have to do a ton of trades until theyd saved enough on broker fees to make back the money they lost buying those standings
honestly the only way i would support any type of buying standing is by turning in faction tags to the navysright now you get faction and corp standing by killing other pilots in faction wars now the pilots dont drop tags but the npc you kill in plexes do and if you have a good enough team you can tank and kill the navys in highsectake those tags go to the respected navys of their enemy and turn the tags in for a very very very small corpfaction gainthis doesnt exactly benefit mission runners apart from any missions they have gained these tags in most of which are somewhat rare from what i can tellsince youve already lost standing with the corpfaction when you killed the navyfaction npc why not have the ability to turn in the tags for factioncorp standing with the other navyseems like a logical choice to me
trading would not give enough of a standing gain for it to make it faster than missions making it utterly pointless
thats only a good idea if you dramatically increase the tag supply
afaik faction warfare only increases your faction standings when you are promoted which requires you to capturedefend complexes or run missionsif killing other pilots gives you faction standings increases then i might need to sign some alts up for faction warfareuh if it is going to be utterly pointless then why are you suggesting itare your standings gains from refining equally pointless or exploitablestandings gains from ratting might be workable but you will still have a hard time balancing them to be worthwhile but not overpowered what size of standings gains are your proposing as reasonable for killing a battleship sized rat maybe capping them in much the same way that security status gains are capped
i said trying to farm it would be pointless in the face of missions that is missionrunning would get your standings up faster
how do you figurehave you figured in the ease of completing a trade compared to completing a missionplease provide a sepecific example of this proposed standings increase for tradinglikewise with refining does this only apply to refining ore or will you also get an increase for refining modules how will the size of the standings increase be calculatedexamples are needed to detirmine if your idea is exploitable or worthwhilei am having a hard time seeing any room in between the two as i expect the standings gains would be exploitable long before they are worthwhile
the discussion of the nano nerfs have got me thinking about the other way small ships are supposed to evade damage from large ships small signature radius currently the turretdrone hit formulas take the traversal of the target as the primary hit determiner with signature being a modifier on that missiles are a bit more divorced than turrets and drones but they still favor heavily speed over signature radiuswhat if the role of signature and traversalspeed were reversed in these formulasoff the top of my head this gets usmwds remain effective for engaging and disengaging quickly but are no longer a good tank due to the signature penaltyafterburners become the speed tanking module as they allow you to increase traversal without screwing your primary tanking attribute still not sure people will fit themsmall ships get new life against larger ships since you cant web them down and obliterate them or shoot them from rangesmaller bore guns and ships like destroyers get a bump in effectiveness for dealing with likesized targetsthe currently underused undersized guns could be made to have a weapon signature and use the ammo type of the lower gun class ie dual 250mm railguns would fire medium hybrid ammo but at a higher rofships and weapons become a bit easier to balance because their tanks and effectiveness against tanks are more predictabletarget painters useful lol
no small signature radius should not make small cheap ships hard to kill sig radius already is a huge boost to survivability and the speed that small ships have which will be more pronounced after the nanonerf will keep them viable small ships shouldnt tank like battleships period even if its done by sig radius rather than hitpoints its the same effect small ships will rely on speed which will be easier after the web nerfoh and target painters already are useful and will become more useful after the nanonerf the sig radius increase was never trivial its just that you went so god damn fast that it didnt matter sig radius increase has a pretty huge effect and tps are very useful
what are you talking aboutas a multiplier changes to signature radius are exactly inverse of transversalmultiplying signature radius by 2 currently has the same effect on turrets as dividing speed by 2the difference is that there are modules that will increasedecrease speed by huge amounts the modules that effect signature radius are much smallerare you suggesting that when the magnitude of speed mods is decreased to prevent ludicrous speeds that they should boost the modifiers for signature radius
this is actually an idea worth looking at closer even if 2x speed is the same as halving signature radius its easy to get 10x speed boosts out of microwarpdrives its near impossible to cut your signature radius the only thing which really has a significant effect on signature radius is a microwarpdriveperhaps allowing afterburners to combine with some method of dramatically reducing signature radius could allow speed tanks to exist without requiring the ridiculous speeds it currently requires
sigh speed is already getting nerfed thats the whole point of the nanonerf to stop ships from going so fast that nothing else matters as for tps again already useful they function like tracking computers for everyone shooting at a given target
have you compared the net effect on tracking for a mwd and an afterburnermwd 10x speed 5x signature radius  20x tracking diffucultyab 25x speed 1x signature radius  25x tracking diffucultyafterburners are already more effective at making you harder to track the problem is that they are 14 as effective at getting you into range
small ships have speed advantage even after nerf all the overeaction is a no brainer plus tracking against bigger ships as someone above said you dont need invulnerability with web nerf bigger ships wont be able to web you and hence track you betteri know missiles are different but ccp is still looking over that
mwd is closer to 56x speed isnt it unless you have a lot of massreduction in case abs will be more than 25x speed
youre dumb target painters are all but entirely worthless your belief otherwise shows your ignorance of the issueone of the biggest problems with the nano nerf is how many of the fast ships rely on speed for their tank to make it work encourages the ridiculously fast ships that the nerf is targeting the signature radius change hes talking about doesnt let a ship sit at a dead stop and absorb damage just by being small it reduces the speed needed to speedtank it means that a 2kms ab inty could dodge fire like an 8kms inty give ships the same ability to avoid damage but at lower speeds making tackling easier without completely screwing ships which rely on speed to not diecan you fill me in on the math involved for this in my experience the mwd is far more effective for avoiding fire in situations where an ab would mean instant death i could be wrong about the realityor maybe its just missiles needing to be changed to follow similar rulessee my previous point when you start stacking cheap implants gang bonuses rigs etc 10x is a moderate figure going beyond that is not difficult
i was intentionally being conservitive in my presentation of that factyes abs typically give a larger boost to speed and mwds give a smaller boost to speed than i cited in my examplei did that so that if anyone doubted that abs had a greater net effect on tracking than mwds an attempt to use more realist numbers would show that abs were more in fact even effective than i already claimed them to bethe point remains mwds are favored because of the absolute increase in speed not because they are more effective at reducing tracking
the math for this is right here notice how speed and signature radius factors are multiplied together that means that multiplying one has the same as multiplying the other a 5x increase in signature radius exactly cancels a 5x increase in speedbecause of the signature radius penalty a mwd setup would need to go 60x  65x faster than a similar ab setup to have a greater impact on tracking mwds are faster than abs but not that much fasterthe reason that abs dont work is that you are normally dead before they get you close enough to be effectiveif you start out close the ab will make you harder to track than a mwd will
that is definately a factorto avoid missiles you need to get above a specific speed that speed is independant of your signature radius or your distance from the person shooting at you it is only dependant on the attributes of the missilewith turrets the speed that you need depends on the distance you are from the person shooting at you and on your signature radius in addition to the attributes of the turretmwd can push you beyond the explosion velocity of a missile an ab cannot
what im suggesting is that the tracking formula be weighted to favor signature over speed this allows players to play the tactical game with mwds but at the same time make them less wonderful as a tankthis is true but what im getting at is that speed serves two purposes a it allows you to engage and disengage and is absolutely required to make use of short ranged weapons and b it allows you to tank what im suggesting is fiddling with the math so that speed retains a but loses some of bno i was suggesting an alternative nanonerf this set of nerfs allows ships to retain the ability to disengage but fitting a ship for that ability doesnt also give you an awesome tank as well
so give mwds a 10x multipler to signature radius instead of a 6x multipler so that activating a mwd will actually make you easier to track than leaving it off basicly have it so that a frigate with a mwd on is like shooting at a cruiser moving the speed that frigate was moving before he turned on his mwd sure he is immune to missilesdrones but you will plaster him with your turrets that could be an interesting alternative to having the mwd deactivated by scramsor are you suggesting that we do something like square the signature radiussignature resolution term in the tracking formula making it impactical to hit with larger guns and unlikely to miss with smaller onesthat would be yet another huge boost to missile boot pve as turrets would be even further removed as being viable for missions
i wasnt thinking anything quite so radical as adding an exponent id think a tunable constant parameter would do the trick though if you were inclined a sigmoid function could be interestinghow to tune the constant or select the function is obviously going to depend on what your world view is how fast do you think battleshipclass weapons should kill a frigate how about cruiserclass weapons are you happy with the number of cruisers youre seeing in fleet situations etc
the problem is the only constant that you have to work with is the exponentremember multiplying signature radius by anything including a constant is the same as dividing speed by that same valueyou need not increase the exponent from 1 to 2 a factional exponent might work but if you want to persue that path you will probably need to provide a suggested value as i doubt you will get enough buy in on the idea to get someone else to do it for you
one other thing one could do is divorce the the signature term from the tracking portion of the hit equation the idea being that even with 0 traversal its tough to hit a small target with a big gun so you get more benefit from speed up close but your signature provides a certain level of protection whatever range you happen to be at
how do you propose that we divorce signature term from the tracking portion of the hit equationhow do you suggest that we get a tough chance to hit against a smaller stationary target without also nerfing the possiblity of getting reliable hits on stationary targets of similar size to your turretshow specificly would you change the tracking equation
ercan i recommend that you go and review how tracking works again signature radius vs resolution is a direct multiplier on turret tracking
how smart culd your idea be if your dumb enough to post it on youre goon main have you figured out that the csm and this forum are not for goons yet non csm member who actualy reds this forum will even look at this idea after they see where op is from countdown til it get silently moved to another forumedit for speling
im not sure what hes getting at as theres already a penalty for shooting at someone smaller with larger guns its the radii of the ammo vs ship signature same as what happens with missilesthe only thing i can figure is that he wants a chance to miss if both ships are stationary which doesnt make any sense to me unless were in a solar wind storm
the point is that speed matters more than sig radius for various reasons if you increase the importance of sig radius and decrease the importance of speed you can reduce overall speeds and the problems it causes without hurting speed tanks given the way it makes webbing easier you could make speed tanks stronger without causing problemsactually that may be a fix in and of itselfgreatly improve the ablow sig radius tanking ability while making sig radius more important so that mwds actually increase the damage you make give people a reason to use afterburners without nerfing mwds directly you could then create a situation where smaller ships with mwds web the afterburner ships but where afterburner ships become vastly better than they are nowas was pointed out an mwd  20x where an ab  25x what if an ab were 5x or more it could create a situation where small mwd ships become more important where webs are something more than stop them from getting to the gate and generally adds to the concept of having good tactics in one situation that can be countered quite easily
by this are you suggesting that abs be boosted to provide a larger bonus to speed perhaps in line with an effective 400 increase after skills and mass reduction mods or did you have something else in mindmwds are in need of a nerf because of their ability to grant near invulnerablity on extreme setups that have become compartively common because of that invulnerablity while boosting ab might increase their popularity it will not solve this problem with mwds
i checked the index already and didnt find any mention of thisccp please add a skill book for advanced starbase defense management so as to allow control of more pos gunswebsjammers goodnessobviously it would prerequisite with lv5 of the already hugely popular starbase defense management skill book and would perhaps be a rank 8 or higher skillalso why youre at it what would be the harm in providing some specialty skills that could allow better lock times or more damage with guns or better jamming of said pos defenses perhaps faction specific skills for use on faction towers with faction modules ie dread guristas starbase jammer calibration or better yet domination starbase artillery specializationoh and put all these yummy new pos gunnerymanagement skills in their own skill category already take them out of the corp management categorythank you csm and ccpanyone hate pos warfare lmao dream on eh
supported 
no new skills please ughsimply make the existing skill work with groups of arrays rather than one at a timemerely enable the pos manager to define anchored structures into arrays of up to skill lvl  itemsexample with lvl 5 you can select 3 guns a web a scram and define it as series a then another 3 gunswebscram and define it as series b with series c being 5 missile launchers ect then when it comes to defending the pos the defender selects a series and defines a target
pos defense should be the domain of at least a small group of players not a solo jobone player being able to man all of the pos guns in an attack allows a single player to do the entire defense and to potentially instapop hostile ships without giving them any chance to react
im ok with removing nonmeta loot but named loot should stay
not really if we keep metamodules as drops it really wont too much
could i clarify how do you expect high end minerals to be acquired in high sec if all t1 meta loot is no longer a feature of npc looti understand people can acquire them via the means of finding hidden belts even then surely not adequatelyor is it that you expect all high end minerals to come from lownull sec
i support this 100 for one simple reasoni firmly believe anything that has a bpo should not be in the drop table i dont care about meta items being in the drop let them stay
its inflationarythe minerals from loot drops tend to balance out the increase in the money supply that results from bounties and mission rewards if you remove this materials faucet youll have to replace it with another one or intoduce an offsetting isk drain or materials prices will rise because money is entering more quickly relative to the rate at which materials are coming insaying that it will help noobish manufacturers assumes that you wont have scads of them out there building stuff with mins they mined themselves and treating the mins as if they were free my prediction is that youd still see the price of most t1 meta 0 modules pegged pretty close to their melt value as someone else above said about all this will do other than potentially causing inflation is nerf the income of resellers who serve as collection channels for dropped loot from new who dont know any better than to sell into the buy order at the nearest station and dont even check the min value of what theyre selling
one the issue of macro farmingtotally signed i refuse to believe the absurd drop in mineral prices is due to players mining i think its large scale industrial macro mining thats causing it  and its eroding the market for legitimate playersi remember being able to make at least a decent living on mining  now no the prices are way too lowpersonally id like to see some kind of efforts to detect macro miners and ban them in droves kick them out over and over until its no longer profitablewhen i jump into a belt and see ships mining as a team not responding to anything but mining all the time day and night in hulks with the player namessdfkasfkghersdflqqfkgefgvfkgeqfdlhkefsdklhcvxlkucall me crazy but i suspect this is not only a macro mining operation but one thats been left alone for a very long time long enough to learn how to handle hulks something needs to be done really
no cockpits and no crackheads eitheredit ohhhhhh look at that you can now say crack
let us paint our ships pinkand with hello kitty on the side plz
as a few posts have stated and as detailed in the camera drones chronicle you are immersed in your sensorydeprived pod when piloting your ship the view you have is from your camera droneswhy do you think the screen goes black while you undockdock temporary interruption of transmission and why you dont actually see yourself jumping when you use a stargate interference obviously the interference is not as bad when warping as you camera drones still work thennice idea but there arent actually any co those places in eve to have a view fromab
removed navigator
kiddiesfighters have cockpitsbiger ships have flight decksnow for the opwhy would i want to look a geen goo your in a pod with a tube shoved up your every hole in bodyand maybe a couple of extra
given that even frigates are dozens of meters long up to battleships which are hundreds of meters long youre not looking at cockpits anyway youre thinking of a bridge and its still wrong
the fact ccp have said well be walking gives us a right have a cpit as well if not then i demand when you leave your ship to walk on the station you are coved with goo that drips off you for five minutes
goo and cockpits this gets my vote
i like it but i fear the lag actually this could make sentry drones more popular because you know thats what people would use over many other drones unless fighters where also includedeven if it was just player controlled drones like station guns a player with a new skilled called it station drone operation goes to the pos interfaces with the pos and takes control of the dronesgive him a max of 250mbitss or 10 drones but he can fly whatever drones he wants if he wants 10 light drones go ahead drone bay would have to be 2000m3 however large enough to have multiple done types etcthis also adds an element of support from the pos something to which the poses dont currently have imagine 10 heavy shield or armor maintenance bots repping the friendly fleetit would still take a pilot at the pos controlling the drones i think with the dynamic power of a drone bay and 10 drones of your choosing would the drone mod would have to eat a lot of cpu
pos fights lag bad enough without adding more drones to the mess bad idea
thanks jadealso ccp there are certainly more people that would love another alliance championships than this thread got suport
i have been wanting to raise this exact issue for a while now so i fully supportbut then again if it has come to the point where csm has to be used for answering trivial issues like that where the hell are we then its sad
i completly understand your point of view this question was asked on the alliance championship forum quite some time ago and never got answered the same question was asked in regards to the forum changes no answer yet unfortunately sometime ccp seems to choose the lalala if i ignore them long enough they might go away option instead of a clear yesno and facing the reaction which is indeed sad i can even understand them from time to time dealing with customersplayers can be difficult and scary doing so via the internet isnt going to make it a lot easier at the end of the day though this form of noncommunication will only make it worsei can also understand that with the wealth of issues raised on this forum and the workload the members of the csm are taking upon themself in their spare time  and i think the csm is doing a good job so thank you guys this issue could be easily considered trivial personally i believe its not the amount of actively involved players and people watching it was crazy it also hugely helps to create a sense of community as the whole cluster is sharing the same events
push
the goon agenda ok guys this is how we break bob they have all these tech ii bpos worth billions lets storm the forums and whine till theyre gone and we can all grind like its lineage iitech ii bpos is no longer a problem your alliance monopolizing high end moons are
okay
look how stupid you are i mean it just stop crank up the font size and look how stupid you are
another cry thread about t2 bpos yes this what the game needs if you dont who owns them now buy them from those players otherwise invent
let me see if i can goon it up rightehrm hm no u
supporting this in spite
we had this discussion numerous times during the election campaign nobody has yet to actually put up any good reasons as for why to do that leave alone justifying how its worth taking ingame assets away as heavyhanded as this is people invested large sums of isk into this making them finite would be upsetting to themi dont have a t2 bpo they arent isk printers either so nice try already
heres to hoping you apply the same logic when asked whether its worth randomly taking away the highvalue moons that alliances have scanned out fought for towered and set up logistics chains to mine the parallels between the two issues are very strong
since you have been here for a whole year you of course must know what you speak of of course you should have equal access to everything so what if it took years to acquire or tens of billions of isk you pay your money to ccp and you deserve it now for no effort or isk if you dont get it stamp your little bee foot and make eve understand how entitled you truly arethere there little bee dont try to buzz so loudly ccp will give you everything you desire just explain it to them as you have to me youve certainly straightened me outwindjammer
didnt you get the memo its now officially okay to take things away from goonswarm next well have to start work on limiting the size of alliances you guys are just too bigwindjammer
i dotheres a large difference between moons and blueprints but what is the point this is not about moons i will happily discuss that in another thread
no really i want you to stop for a second and actually read what you wrotejust think about that for a secondthat monopoly was fought for internet spaceships were blown up to wrench those moons from the cold dead hands of their previous owners also who cares about bobs assets this is clearly a satire proposal something you were too vapid to notice from the get gothuslook at how stupid you are
why was this moved to general discussion
in my opinion it would be sensible to remove t2 bpos as they are relict from the old times however outright removal would be somewhat unfair against people who have invested a lot of resoures to acuire themone of the solutions i see would be propability based declining of bpo per run produced say  taking damage like t2 laser crystals until its destroyed eventually say  balanced for approx a year of continious production or just converting them into bpcs with enough runs for year of production
are you seriously saying that 1 billion a month made in complete safety and with almost no work not an isk printing machine
2 proposals1 now that we have auctions there should just be daily t2 bpo auctions by npc corporations so that existing t2 bpos will be devalued over time slowly diminishing value of t2 bpos t2 bpo distribution fairness good isk sink bad for invention2 t2 bpos should be worse than invented bpcs for example they should get set to me 10 or so and research not possible or at least invented bpcs should have a realistic chance to be better than anyall t2 bpos small change good nerf to t2 bpos theres still stuff in the game that you cant get anymore
no the lottery was bad enough and most people never got anything some people got more than 1 rather not have that crap againjust remove t2 bpos altogether and make invention the only way to get t2 ships
the forums ate my last post not that anyone will miss it but the point was that there are benefits and drawbacks to t2 bpos assuming that theres a lot of advance warning i wouldnt mind if they were all deleted i do invention and dont own any t2 bpos so im not completely biased but i think everyones biased here
oh is it this time of the week again yawn
i am suggesting that if someone is making 1 billion a month on a 30 billion or 60 billion investemnt even if they sit on their toilet is ok most t2 bpos have been bought out from the lucky winner of the lotto and are now in the hands of the people who earned the isk one way or another to buy them
t2 bpo is as anoying as when tti had the t5 mining laser that they bought from someone else
your calculations are also wrong ishtar bpo would yield some 152b a month atleast with minimum 50million profit per ship astarte would be alot higher
my calculations are based on producing all of the above for over 2 years with overall market fluctuations in mind just because this month it is little more profitable does not mean that the next month the same will occur it usually does not with moon mineral price fluctuations the profits fluctuate as well what i described was averages and no i certainly do not mind someone who invests 60 billion isk into astarte bpo to make 162 bill a month
except most people havent invested 30 billion isk in their t2 bpos those who did well investment carries risk and expecting years of continuous isk printing is nothing more than hubrisedit why was this thread moved into general discussion
i think that the holders of t2 bpos cant possibly control the market on what you call the good items they are too popular and the volumes are too high if all of the holders of the bpos colluded unlikely they still couldnt set the price of these items so low that they were impossible to make a profit on for inventors thus maintaining their monopoly because they cannot supply 100 of the demand there isnt really a way for them to cartel and keep the price of these items high either because if they tried the item would just get more attractive to inventon the not so good t2 bpos nobody really cares they arent attractive to invent anyway because they arent popular and even the bpo holder probably makes jack on themshort version there isnt a problem here that needs solving invention is working just finewhat could be really cool though is to provide a tiny really tiny chance that an invention job could result in a bpo by tiny i mean it would happen a small number of times a year gamewide this would give those who invent an item regularly some chance to eventually get a bpo for one that would pretty much limit it to serious t2 inventorproducers and exclude those running bunches of research alts hoping to strike it richthe very long term net effect of his would be what youre asking for the bpos would gradually be devalued because they would slowly become more common and invention on that item would eventually stop unless demand continued to rise because production would have shifted to bposthis would be really cool for those who have invested time and isk setting themselves up as inventorproducers but game wise it would only make sense if ccp planned to regularly introduce new items that would then be produced only by invention for a while and then likewise slowly shift to production from bpos
ok who let the goons out of caod furthermore what goon dev moved this crap from assembly hall here
its all part of their master plan to ruin everyone elses game play and make them cry bud thats why they play the game you know didnt you get the memo
goon alt detected
lock and delete from my cold dead hands clutches eagle bpo hardi actually sold one this month
nah my main is someone you never heard of in a corp you never heard of and id like to keep it that way
the vast majority of t2 bpo revenue was captured before the invention patch now all youre getting by using t2 bpos is basically invention costs and then some anyone can buy a t2 bpoim sure if you made an offer people couldnt refuse sellers would be lining up t2 bpos have already been heavily devalued remember how cerbs dropped from like2 250mil to 80mil yeahall lost profit marginif you cant afford to buy one thats your fault not the t2 bpo holders faults
quite a bit of those profits got transferred to moonholders since rare moon mins are now the limiting factor in production and the only point in the value chain that is vulnerable to manipulation and cartelling i guess thats better in a sense at least you can fight over a moonthere was a time when many of the big alliances didnt even bother with t2 chains there wasnt any money in it unless you had the bpos
ive looked at this thread and its pretty much a gd thread you whined about me so now im gonna whine about youif this is what the csm forum is like then i think a spanish proverb is in order aunque la mona se vista de seda mona se queda essentially a monkey in a silk dress is still a monkey
cute one problem with your indirect whine at us is the small issue that star fraction as an entity owns exactly zero t2 bpos have a nice day though
why not make it such that t2 production can only be done at a pos and the that the blueprint has to actually be at the pos this would bring it more inline with the risk reward ratio of everything else
i like how this thread always follow the pattern of nerf t2 bpos instead of make invention betterbut then again this time we are talking goons anything that can hurt even the slightest the other players its great for them
i have nothing to say neither does the opthe universe is in balance
is it this time of a month alreadybtw speed nerf is not in yet  you can go back whining about it
invention has already overtaken t2 bpos as most seeded on market there is no issue at hand and t2 bpos also change hands a lot which is good as it moves isk around
which means invention has developed far enough that ccp can finalize the shift from lottery to invention by removing any remaining bpos
i kind of agree with this but i think that those that have bpos already should get to keep them  i dont agree with how the old system distributed them but i dont think those players should get humped by the changes id like to see t2 bpcs making their way to the average player like me who basically has no chance of otherwise ever getting hold of one
t2 bpos should either be removed from the game or else there needs to still be a way for those not around for the lottery or lucky enough to have a dev in their alliance give them a bunch to obtain themperiodits  poor game design to have unobtainable but still extremely valuable and important to the game economy items in the gameeither re introduce t2 bpos say as a rare result of invention or convert them all to bpcs and use the invention system as the exclusive method of producing t2 bpcs
i own four minor t2 bposim not against an eventual change but any such change would need to be announced at least a full year in advance better yet 2 full yearsthis is because some folks not me paid massive amounts of isk for their t2 bposif it was announced that ccp is planning in two years time to make remove or change t2 bpos such bpos would still have a lot of value and earning potential but such value would shrink as time passed and any new buyers would base the amount they payed on the approaching date
um thats great except that its totally insanewho the hell is going to buy a 10 bpo you do understand that it would amount to a license to lose money forever right i guess it would provide some amusement value watching nubs buy something completely worthless becasue its a t2 bpo if more bpos were seeded and im not saying they should be they should as i said above be the very rare result of invention jobs that way they would go to those who are specialized on and active in that part of the game as more bpos gradually entered the game theyd be traded more frequently and eventually be expensive but obtainable for anyone who wanted to specialize in producing that item in line with the cost of capital bpos todayccp should really only consider it if theyd like to use invention as a way of producing newly introduced items and gradully transition them to bpo based production as the market for them matures given that they dont introduce new items that often though it might not make any sense invention as a profession would die out
t2 production from bpos is easier and cheaper because of the me difference between invention bpcs and a researched bpo it not only reduces mineral cost but it also reduces time so your profit per day per manufacturing slot is high though remember an inventor can just make another alt and get 10 more slots a t2 bpo is only in one slot if you want to reduce the impact that t2 bpos have on the market and reduce profits for t2 bpo holders then simply improve the me that you get from decryptors and increase the drop rate of decryptors i hold 6 t2 ammo bpos that i bought and the profit per day on them is so low now that they are not worth making my manufacturing slots are better used on more lucrative goodsany reduction in costs of t2 production will increase the demand for moon minerals and push more isk towards the holders of those moons
yeah the minimum margin the average producer is willing to accept isnt going to change much and the moon mins are already the limiting factor if prices started to fall because of decreased production costs demand would rise and the mins would get even more scarce youd hit price equliibrium again but with the min sellers getting a proportionatly larger slice of the piemaybe thats what ccp intended all along make the really valuable resource something out there in space that you have to fight for and defend instead of a bpo that someone can hide away in their empire hanger
no workno riskthat can be only considered trollinghave you ever tried to build a t2 ship no then shut up and get a clue first and if you have then you know that quite a lot of work is involvedno risk and you think that the materials just drop from nowhere into your hangar and the ships are sold instantly where they are built i see quite often freighters full of t2 ships blown up suicide ganks you knowso it is neither work free nor risk freebesides as already mentioned  if you want cheap t2 ships go and invent them there is no way those t2 bpo holders can compete with invention while i might have a profitable t2 bpo it is only one at a time while i can make as many inventions and build jobs with alts etc as i want and thus multiplying my profits more and more with some alts i can easily produce 10 or 15 times more ships than a bpo holder  so what he might produce cheap but i get the bulk dealsi cant see any problems with t2 ship bpos especially when the demand for t2 ships is high those bpos have not really a noticable impact on the marketand no i dont own a t2 ship bpo
i could have sworn i heard something about invention i hear its a solution to the t2 bpo problem and means that even the best t2 bpos now take around 410 years to earn back their face value
i do t2 ship production like you from invention its either time intensive mining some of your own stuff or very capital intensive buying everything if you have a big bankroll its probably the most iskhour played in the game for an individuali dont find it to be particularly risky ive never been the target of a suicide but then again i dont and wouldnt haul a freighter full of golems a few at a time is all im willing to risk which probably puts my risk profile in line with doing l4 missions in an expensively fit shipif you dont have a lot of capital to begin with its not the license to print money that everyone thinks it is if youre undercapitalized you can probably only produce one ship at a time and then only infrequently if you do have a lot of capital youve probably been in the game a long time and have earned the position you now enjoy of course that doesnt stop others from envying that position and thinking its unfair that you have it but thems the breaks
i would like to see all t2 bpos expire 2 years from today
i think things as they are now in the t2 world are balanced out just finebefore t2 invention a select few had the isk to aquire t2 bpos some got them from devs but thats another story altogetherthe point is that billions of isk were spend by some lucky individuals corporations and factions to get their hands on these isk making bps and they promptly abused that monopoly by asking rediculous prizes for every ship they churned out of the factorieshulks for instance were usually close to a billion iskthen invention came along and hurt the wallets of the t2 bpo owners tremendously and i think this is a good thing after their pricegaugingnowadays every month old character flies around with t2 modules which used to be affordable only to the filthy rich in the eve communitythe point is that all the people owning a t2 bpo spend billions of isk aquiring and then lots of time researching themccp has reached out to both t2 bpo owners and the rest of eve by keeping bpos valuable due to the possibility to research them for good material efficiencies and making t2 items more affordable and available through invention which makes bpcs only with crappy material efficienciesi like this balance and it certainly was a great solution to fix a big problemyou cant just take away all the bpos from individuals corporations and factions after theyve spend billions of iskies on themlet it beedit and nope i dont have a single t2 bpo
first and foremost i got through most of the second page of this thread so this could have been suggested already if so i suck now on to the topicas i see the problem people are saying effectivelypeople who have t2 bpos have in the past had a huge financial advantage they continue to have an advantage because the bpos have been researched and have a significantly lower manufacture cost than invented bposso how about implementing a degradation period for t2 bpos for every insert time interval here the bpos lose a point of me and pe itd have to be a nice timeframe maybe once a quarter when that happens the bpo can either be pulled from production for a short period of time to be reresearched or it can continue to be used albeit at reduced efficiencyat the same time slightly improve the base me and pe of invented bpos between the 2 it should allow the t2 bpos to remain more profitable than invented bpos but it decreases the profit disparity and requires a little more effort on the part of the bpo owner another option is to use the same degradation idea but flag the bpos as unresearchable and they disappear once me and pe both get negative and if this is implemented there is a decent grace period 6 months prior to this allowing any bpo owners to research the bpos as much as possible effectively improving the length of time theyll have to use the bposrandom crazy thoughts it they suck oh welleditramificationst2 construction materials and everything used to create them will likely decrease in price somewhat due to decreased costs potential for trivial fluctuations in pos fuel costs due to the potential to altered pos fuel requirements stemming from the occasional need to redo research on bposshort term increase in profit margins followed by lower cpm cost per mod as the market forces readjust the prices to accomodate a reduced production cost one would suspect that the profit margins would be similar percentage wise to the present situation people i can see negatively affected those owning moon mining poss for direct resale could have their profits reduced slightlypersons whom complete the entire invention process from moon mins through reactions and such to invention and production could be adversely affected if the reduced sale prices are not equivalent to the boost in production efficiency of t2 bpcs people owning t2 bpos will have their profit decrease slightly owing to either reresearch or reduced efficiency needsif i missed anything obvious please feel free to correct me
so what you are saying is thata no datacore costsb no meta item costsc no interface costsd no copy slot costse no invention slot costsf able to me and pe researchmeans you dont make more isk per production run than someone who inventsyoure correct about volume though
a t2 bpo holder can make more isk  manufacturing slot hour on that item than i can he can only occupy one slot with that item for me the question is whether i can make more  slot hour making the item than i can making some other item if i can i build it if i cant i dont whether he can make more from that one slot making that one item than i can doesnt matter to me
no way to remove these bpos without leaving the owners  who probably bought it  with a giant hole in their wallet the part they invested in the actual bpo if ccp would resort to this they would infact be moderating the market they have so strived to keep solely playerbased aside from starbase accessoriesfuel and skillbooks
you can make more money selling 100 markup cruisers you just have to put them in the right stations
any change to t2 bpos needs to be announced a year or two in advance
poorly thought out and pointless ideamaking invented bpcs researchable would solve pretty much all of the whinage if people wanted to spend the time bringing their bpc down to 10 mepe a process that takes the same amount of time as doing so with a bpo not longer then they can balance out the profit margin by reducing their wastet2 bpo owners will still have a degree of profit in that they dont need to wastebuy datacores to produce a few runs
spamskunk
id have to see the math on that researching up a bpc sounds like a bad proposition to me compared to using the same research slot to research up any bpo that produced a similar profit  slot hour it might make sense for someone who is trying to build their own golem on the cheap and doesnt mind waiting for it but for someone doing it as a business it probably doesnt make much sense though like i said i could be wrong i havent done the math
simple solution institute a buyback policy and forcefully repurchase the bpos for fair compensation the issue is that this feature no longer exists either ccp will have to keep diluting it with invention improvements or otherwise balance the situation and at least this would be a mechanism that would compensate the players
i dont think that most people get that removing t2 bpos would likely decrease the profit inventors made higher input prices and also increase the price consumers paid for some rarer items in short it wouldnt solve anything other than jealousy and if were going there why not remove every unique item as wellive looked at several t2 bpo auctions and the people buying are spending 410 years profit on buying them which means that theyre not actually making the new owners any money unless they hold them for at least that long unlikely the people that intitially won them have already made the buck if there was a buck to be made so all youre doing is punishing the people that have bought them the same way anyone else can buy them on the open market which is quickly turning t2 bpos into collectors items only because buying one will never make back the outlaythere are t2 bpos out there that make less than 7 million isk per month a factory slot going for an entire month making 7 million isk you make more than that with a mediocre t1 bpothe lottery is dead respawning t2 bpos will not happen get over it if you really must have one go buy one the crappy ones will sell for less than a billion isk granted you will never make that back on some of them even if you spent the next hundred years building off it but hey you know best
people that own t2 blueprint originals should be punishedoooooohhhh yes punishedwhipsstrapsleathermmmmmmmmmmmm punished
the reality is ccp have already dilluted bpos hugely the best t2 bpos out there make about a billion isk per month the last one of these went for 70 billion isk almost six years profit at current rates and as datacore prices drop that figure will go up as time goes on to the point where it never actually makes it backinvention killed the era of ridiculously high t2 prices there are t2 modules now invented en masse going for less than 500k when they were 25mil before you will make less with most t2 bpos than you can with many t1 bpos and theres a newsflash on any commonly used item inventors are only competing with other inventors for the price because if the demand outweighs the bpo supply inventors will invent until it is unprofitable to do so the bpo owner if they sold any cheaper than the invention cost would just have the item bought and resold above the invention cost because the demand is there to support it t2 is now common and dirt cheap previously fitting t2 was considered a luxury now its a baselinewhy would you even do a buyback what would it solve and how impossible would it be to decide on fair compensation without knowing what the market price and build price for the item is for everyone involved what if that price was less than they bought the bpo for last week  what if it was twice as much  who would cry foul over any change and see it as ccp favouring one group or another invention is the solution its here and its getting cheaper in the end and for alot of them already the reality is t2 bpos will become irrelevant you dont need them to make t2 items and you can make far more inventing and still using the same number of slots as a bpo owner because youre inventing something that is more profitable than that particular bpo
youre comparing isk per production run try comparing isk per hour of an inventor of a typical t2 bpo vs the isk per hour of an inventor inventing one of the more profitable t2 items obviously the isk per production run of the same item will be more but being an inventor you can easily switch items to the more profitable ones which do change with market forces while the bpo owner is stuck printing out the same item regardless of how low the margins go or how nerfed the item he has the bpo for gets obviously the bpo owner can invent too and were already at the stage where many t2 bpos are being shelved and not produced from because the manufacturing slot of the char that can build it is worth more isk building something elseof course the reality is for owners of those products having the bpo converted into limited runs would actually be of benefit as the price of the item would have to rise to the invented cost and they would actually make more inventors of course would make less and the consumer would pay more
the people buying them today are basically trading a pile of isk for an income stream on the assumption hope that the asset itself will retain its value or at least not depreciate too much while they hold itthats the assumption anyway truth is that a 1015 return on capital per year in eve is really poor youd do better way better taking your 60 billion and running 10 manufacturing slots full of something anything that provided your a modest markup of 815 but allowed you to turn that money over monthlyyeah its a purchase for someone looking for a collectors item or for someone who just doesnt have a lot of business smarts
of course the bpo owner can always build for much lower costs than a t2 inventer can but that is not the pointthe point is that the demand for t2 items also and especially ships is now that high that no matter how fast the t2 bpo holder can build he will always be in the minority compared to the inventorsand maybe he can try to crash the market with ridiculous low prices but that little try of market manipulation would be quickly swallowed up by the huge demand for t2 itemsit is the t2 inventor who sets the price for the item not the bpo holder any more this is why there is no way for the bpoholder to compete because he is just a small piece in the big t2 market nowsure he can do his little profitable business but compared to the whole market negligtable he has no power any moreand you know what bpos do not scale well if you have a corp with 100 people then it still would be only 1 person using one slot but with inventions you could put all the 100 people to use and let them all make money invention scales absolutely prefectlyso those who complain about t2 bpos have no understanding of inventions and the market the real winner with t2 invention are the moon guys  and of course those who needs to fit their ships
what i find funny is how people say there isnt a significant profit in having t2 bpos rather than invention but are also adamant that they get 12 years of advance notice if they are to be removed
has nothing to do with the profit bud has to do with the value of the asset if they have some notice they could make a decision to sell the remaining inome stream for cash or just continue to build them until they were removed one is betting that the price is going to go down over time the other is betting that its going to go upjust yanking them from the game would be a huge fu to those that hold them and them being in the game really truly isnt a problem the bpo holders cant control the market anymore as has been explained
sounds like another goon whine tbh first it was titans then cynojammers and now t2 bpo evil bob
remove high sp characters  everyone should have 3 mil sp at most 
as it is now its artificial you have corps deccing corps simply for noob kills or just to grief thats as artificial as it can get there needs to be reason behind it all its up for the deccing corps to decide what that is and its up for the devs to figure out a way to implement it so after its all said and done each corp involved in the war has a clear road to victory what are reasons to dec a corp1 remove from space2 extract isk3 killscan you think of anymore reasons wars will be so much better if they had meaning and ways for both sides to achieve victory why should a corp be able to dec war and then simply end it with not recourse with no fullfillment of winning or pain of losing talk about zero risk all you do is pay and poof you got a war ccp needs to stop making isk a factor in power
i like 3 but it shouldnt be reqiured 4 is alright 5 has been discussed quite a bit and i have no issue with it 6 is nice but as people have said it would be simpler to make the wars transfer to the player for the remainder of the week even if they leave1 i do not agree with at all and 2 just sounds stupidhowever you do not have my support as i believe the wardec system is fine
afterburners on interceptors doesnt work the light drones just goggble em up
npc target me all the time when i warp into missions i just warp out and wait for the runner to come back and kill them for me 
if i were a member of the csm i would ask you to add a checkboxx the above is a false dichotomy since it is well possible not to support ccps current ruling and still argue against aggro or for that matter to feel the mission runner does own the wreck but aggro is not the best solution here ankhesentapemkah more or less picked up on this for which she deserves credit it is a false dilemma and as such the topic deserves more open discussion i personally feel that middle ground can be found for example if a mission runner would be able to configure whether or not their wrecks are open for salvaging the cans would clearly show up as free for all or owned on the overview making the situation clear for all involved this would require two separate states for wrecks complicating the game logic somewhat but not to a great extentanother solution would be to have a timer on a wreck allowing free salvaging after the wreck has been in space for over say 15 minutes but resulting in aggro when salvaged before that time this would require a serious amount of database bookkeeping though which is expensive in terms of performance and spaceeven farther outlying options exist like flat out disallowing the salvage of any wrecks you do not own not that i think that is a good idea but it further serves to show that the choice presented is not all there is to itanyone on their way to the quote button to state that my own logical fallacy here is argumentum verbosium stuff it i think the proposed flagging is a bad idea by the way for some of the reasons mentioned the background reason for wreck ownership to be the way it is the typical nonpvp setup of a salvager etc i would say it would be fair to flag the salvager against the wreck owning corp and have present npcs open fire on the salvager same with salvaging a players wreck flagging the salvager to their corp this way salvaging a mission will still be dangerous except when the mission runner is done and warps offgreetingsgrismar
ok bottom line hereyour grieving your stealing players loot knowing that they can take no actions towards you at that time besides shooting their wrecks which keeps them from getting it you do it for the soul fact of just taking the loot from them you are a leach upon all mission runners and the fact they can not step on you is just annoyingany mission runner who does not intend on salvaging wrecks would more then willingly give them to you if you askedomg a war dec so you can hide in a station avoid them or just move to an npc corp yeah we all know war decs dont really work unless the other side wants to fightyou are grasping at straws here just to justify that you are indeed stealing and should not be able to be shot atyou use things like ohh we have in invested in stuff to do this and we are not interested in conflict then stop freaking stealing from people use your skills for other things or ask the missioner if you can have the wrecksstop being lame and leaching off the backs of those who work
i got my learning skills up and it took nothing from the game for me i wouldnt train them up to 5 but ive got most of them at 3 and 4 the only 5 i have is the one hat take ten percent offanyway what i did was wait until i had to get a skill to level 5 such as iteron v the time it took was 39 days by training my learning skills i managed to get it to 30thats what you do its kinda like training multiple skills at once
people flying nano ships also call themselves nanoswhat if someone is actually gay and happen to fly nanoships
see i have no problems with none of the skin colors or sexual preferences people might have what i do have a problem with is when someone talks about bigotry in the same sentence in which he asks the authorities to stop people from voicing their opinions as it hurts their feelingslive and let live aight it works if you want it to work but then you have to accept that it works both ways
he was telling everyone that they shouldnt whine that eve is harsh and that you just simply get  now and thenccp just kicked the people that trained really long for t2 fitted nano ships with support skills right in the nuts spit in their face and did it againpeople should be able to train for something and expect it isnt nerfed till it doesnt move anymore how ironic move  nano nerf when they are able to fly itccp shouldnt nerf stuff  they should make more counters to it that way the people that have trained their ass off for a cool ship  fittings still can fly their ships without stuff changed  and the whiners can train their asses off for counters to it
lmfaois that not what your doing now whining about whiners yeah gg on the fail to you for being someone you hate your selfdude are you serious this coming from a matar i bet you got a super hyped up vagabon that can do like 1billion kmsi love people who are whining about the speed changes and dont even understand the fact that their nanoed out vagabon and snake implants are still gonna get their ship cruising pretty freaking fast your thread just drips of uninformed quickly posted out of frustration crap yes straight up utter crap in every way form and fashion have you even logged into the test server to try out the speed changes or did you just come in here whining that your 6 month old training is going to be ruined omg you mean the ship is now going to do what it was met to dothey are nerfing all ships speeds that means if your ship went faster then other ships it will sill still go faster then other ships well with the inty not included of course they are simply making it a bit harder to run out of range in like 4 secounds and so that you cant out run missiles sense missiles damage is modified via speed and target size instead of a hit or miss like turrets ohh yeahyou guys who complain about training for so long for nano ships you knew they were broken when you started training for them thats why you trained for them and yet now you whine that they are getting fixed yeah well shouldnt have jumped on the bandwagon hey fan bois get over it adapt or stop playing personally i think that anyone who wants an unfair advantage or linear game play shouldnt be in eve so if you leavecan i have your stuff
hmmm how long have you guys been flying if you havent been flying for over 2 years you werent there to see the adopton of theft agression and you probably werent there to see most of the changes made or even know why they were made and dont try to argue there was a reason because ill ignore you like i ignore my kids when they whine over whats for dinnerat one time in the past we had what is now being argued over yup back before so many balance nerfs and rebalance nerfs we had it better the theft agression rules were perfect if a pilot was illegally ganked and the ganker concordokkened the only pilot with rights to the victims loot was the victim however during war both parties had rights to the wreck as a pirate and empire war we i liked the fact both i and my targets had access to our wrecks i had quite a few of you losers steal from my kills and many of you paid with the loss of your own shipyeah you know who you aremy name tops the list of your loss mail yeah yeah cry me a river and send me a hate letter they look great on our crybaby boardthen all of a sudden we peeps at war no longer get kill rights on thieves who take our targets wrecks wtf man ccp get this written down and put it on every monitor in your officesi would rather the guys who killed me get the loot he rightfully earned rather than some cheap third party nightcrawler who will be docked or 5 systems away before i get back to the site the thieves got a warning that they are open to attack by both parties at war and now that has been ruined its bad when i have to contact my war target and tell him his loot was stolen byinsert name here and ill leave him alone just to gank that thief again send crybaby hate mail to johnpauljones for posting on the utg crybaby board
remove all wreck and nonsecured can ownership also remove ship loot and make everything considered salvage makes for a more believable system and also byproduct eliminates a common form of rookie system baiting
as a spy in smash during the conflict i have the perspective that very few people get to have during these types of conflicts that perspective showed goonfleet destroying smash and rk in every single arena we had more caps then they did larger gangs better allies better fcing better organization since the majority of us was in one corp any bickering was just between individuals better fittings on our ships we named a station bwfit multispecs on everything for a reason better spying and better sneakiness in general even if pos mechanics would of been different we still would of wiped the floor with them
counterpoint all it took was one proton torpedo from one aspiring young jedi in a small fighter to blow up the death star and save the rebel base on yavin
i think itd be a safe bet to not worry about small gangs necessarily affecting sov as long as they have a way of raiding fixed infrastructure to do damage that way shc has a thread discussing what people would change about sov and one suggestion i liked was basicallyunlink pos from sovereigntyremove pos shields and gunsput the former pos shields and guns on a sovereigntyclaiming structure anchored at planetsfigure out a way to prevent ddd from obliterating the now much more vulnerable logisticsonly pos and its modulesid add to thatadd the ability to put lowsec caliber sentry guns at stargates and pos for light fire against raiding forcesimplement an arraystyle system for cynojammers and the likeprevent the jump bridge from working in a cynojammed system
so your fix to pos warfare is to create a new type of pos
thats what people are asking for vov
hmmm so when youre invading a system with a fleet and need to drop a staging pos the main point of which is the pos shields you now have a small fraction of the possible locations at which you might be able to do so compared with the current system and since these new planetpos are shieldsandguns you cant anchor a cha or sma there to hold ammo or to refit or whateverthen on the carebear side if you want to drop a ratting pos to act as a safespot and lootmins depository for ratting or mining you have to take up a comparatively rare planetslot to do so rather than any old unused moonya sounds like this was thoroughly thought through by someone who has a lot of firsthand experience in 00
the one complaint i have about this plan kelsin is that youre stripping all the defensive capability off poses maybe make them smaller but they should still exist unmanned objects primarily dwelling in insecure space should not be utterly defenceless
dark age of camelot does a good job at keeping both small scale 8man and large scale aj inc pvp rewarded wellits simple small scale pvp doesnt effect large scale pvp so much directly but indirectly metametameta so metapl using sharkcircling tactics to take out 13 of a bob fleet doesnt undo bob but it definitely weakens them for a larger engagement they might be on their way to they know they cant contend with a full hundred man fleet with a gang of 20 but they can set traps to kill a few here and there pick off stragglers bait overconfident nubbins away from the fleet much like 8mans can and do in daocgoonfleet on the other hand we call zergsurfing or aj inc their intent isnt to weaken a fleet with guerrilla warfare but to slug it out and may the bigger fleet win and thats rvr towerkeeprelic taking gameplay compared to 8man or smallman gameplaythe reason this style of play isnt as rewarding in eve is cause the only reward in eve is isk theres no realm points or pwn points to accumulate in eve its all about sovereignty isk and meaningless killboard stats people smallman in eve simply because its fun not so much because it is meaningfulif small fleet engagement victories were rewarding in some way this would be no small fleet complaintsand seriously these ideas for helping small man gangs playing a serious roll in sov warfare are terrible and would ruin the game for the people who currently enjoy it getting thousands of people to cooperate is a challenge in itself and anything that would make little of the organizational difficulty of current sov warfare would be a detriment to eve
okay one thing that has bugged me since the beginning of this csm yes ive read all the chat logs how sad am i is the fact that things get escalated on the basis of people not disliking them enough at present the idea seems to be that you vote to escalate unless you have a strong objection and i think this is a dangerous precedent as well as not what people voted for i would like to point out that at this stage i am not singling anyone out in the csm as i think everyone is doing itpersonally i am of the belief that as csm delegates when you vote to escalate a issue to ccp you are staying something along the lines of look at this this is important enough that all of us that we feel you should invest some time looking at at the moment there seems it be more along the lines of look at this this is relatively uninteresting and enough of us didnt care to vote it down my reasoning behind this is as follow ccp delegates a finite amount of resources in this case man hours to looking at the proposals escalated by the csm if a topic is escalated to them it will take a portion of that resources away which leaves less time for those matters which do matter enough to enough people that you vote to escalate because it is deemed important i am not for one minute considering that a topic such as i want my thorax to be pink will get as much attention as a wonder new a perfect way to radically alter the marketplace to be easier to use and less server issues and will cure lag and give everyone back rubs but even the process of dismissing an idea as a waste of time to even consider takes some of that precious time ccp have given to the csm process so please in future can you just think whether or not you want to spend your coin as it were on some of the issues that are advanced mini rant over edit for spelling
the thing about that is a lot of the small issues do matter most of the things brought forward are good commonsense proposals and theyre the sort of thing ccp should be addressing also a lot of them dont take too long especially given that this is the first incarnation of the csm all the issues that have been around for yearsswitch all ammo at once say are getting brought forward ccp knows the answer and doesnt have to think about it but the players want to hear it
in the middle of the nano nerf hype i hope you will find this refreshing idea worthy to show direction how to change the local in the futureprevious suggestions were based on ancient ideas like completely eliminate local channel or allow people leaving this channel these are bad in basic imho because intelligence should work on more levels than having or not havingshort introductionthe basic idea of neural networks is that whenever you your ship enter a new system your ship connects to an information hub located within the system which provides it with information about local a system can have multiple information hubs which can be maintained both by npc and by player organizations the kind of information available through these information hubs depends on the level of access the hub is providing to the pilot the level provided is standingdependent their subnetworks can be standingdependant and subscriptionbased too the maximum level of intel provided by player maintained networks is also might depend on the system sovenerity level of the entity providing the information possible hubs players can use in empire space the system holder faction is providing hub access to anyone who subscribes for this service and has high enough standings to access the hubs this means that the amarr the caldari the gallente and minmatar and also the pirate factions operate their own neural networks players may be able to connect to furthermore hiquality services can be accessed like the faction navies eg caldari navy subnetworks providing a better quality of service but also at a higher price in hisec concord is providing a free neural network as well which is available to anyone but criminals in 00 player corporations and alliances have to deploy their own hubs if they want to use them a neural network hub structure can be anchored to posses which provides information to the pilots who have access to it the quality of service depends on the subscribtion and the maximum qos achievable by hub structures is same with the souvenerity level of the system hubs located in sov 3 and sov 4 systems are much more accurate and detailed than those in sov 0 sov 1 and sov 2 the other way to get infromations in systems one does not have a friendly pos in is the use of role ships recons andor neural network probes recon ships may serve as a neural network hub and the level provided could depend on whether the ship is cloaked or not and skills ofc the probes are similar to scan probes they can be launched from probe launchers and provide some level of qos to all those who are in the same gangnetwork
concept details the neutal network is a concept where the main idea is to force the players to organise their local for themselfes the base idea is simple if you do nothing you wont receive any kind of intelligence about people present do for it is not as hard as it might sound at first equipments like system scanners at poses or proper scan probes or role ships can provide information on many levels about who is along with youthe many levels means four levels its not an accident that its the same number like the sovereignity levels have anchorable devices cant provide better quality of information level than the level of sov in the system recon ships and covert ops class frigates may provide intelligence on three levels 123 based on if the ship is cloaked or not or in case probes were used for the better quality what kind of them were gathering the informationin high sec systems people may use npc faction networks if their standings are good enough towards the given faction concord network should be also present and avaliable for everyone whose the security status is a non negative number lower personal sec status means an autokicksince its kind of impossible having good enough standings towards all npc factions there would be gaps in low sec by default which should be normal increasing the sight of a pilot might be avaliable by player networks in low sec also but not with the current sovereignity system if it would be possibe having major sov and minor sov in a system low sec could turn into paradise for a lot of people maintaining low sec networks and renting them for some isk could be a profession and ofc source of conflict anyways there is a big potential in this imhoit should be possible to join multiple networks at the same time joining a system where there are multiple networks present always means that player receives the best quality of information automatically networks sould be working both on alliance and corporation level this means joining the amarr network is nice but im sure by joining the imperial navys network might be better source in most cases just like the khanid network in in the khanid kingdom each faction has its main network joining its subnetworks faction member corps should be optional
in case of player network the situation is similar to npc networks if a corporationalliance founds a new network the first thing which has to be defined is the nain network node which is the default custom filtered node intel sources can be strained off by information type like poses onlyships onlyprobes only xy corp assets only or other restictions like max 1st and 2nd level only subnetworks which provides quicker better information can be reserved for true alliesmore iskin a system which is no mans land if there is no intel source present there should be no intel at all except about people on common networks im sure many people are concerned about the future of roaming gangs and stuff having a friendly recon ship in system solves the problem you wont fly blind as long as there is a covert opsrecon ship with you and on a common networkalso if this system comes live sending distress signals finally can come into game the main problem with distress signals in the current system is obvious if you are already in trouble you wont call in your enemies too if you are able to pick which networks should transmit the distress signal only your friends will receive your message the message in itself is not enough people on common network with the distress signal frequency also see the location as a warpable beaconto avoid fun with sending distress signals this should not be a free feature i guess 1m isk should be enough to make people bored with thiswith the neural network new type of agent missions can be implemented like travel to hostile territory probe some stuff kill some stuff rest like usual if you are still reading you must be really curious what are these levels exactly what kind of difference might be there well let me introduce my guessbasic 1 level1 minute delayshows friendlies in system by namedisplays whether unknown presence is in systemreports about ships entering  leaving the system names only for friendliesplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesstory is simple 1 neutralhostile guy left the system then later a friend who is on a same network like you has joined the system the refresh rate of this level is 1 minute or whatevermoderate 2 level30 secs delayshows friendles in system by nameshows local countreports about ships entering  leaving the system names only for friendliesplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesthe story here is simple too 1 neutralhostile left the system then 3 of them joined this level provides double speed refresh rate compated to the basic leveladvanced 3 levelno delayprovides list of both enemies and friends by nameshows both enemies and friends entering system by namecustomizable statistics like summariesplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesthis is what you could see on the third level its actually same with the current local except it is able to show who is joining and leaving the systemplease visit your user settings to reenable imagesand this is what local could be if players were able to customize the channel if high level intel is available im sure many people would not care joinsleaves for each random people if in a middle of a fleet battle and lag it would be cool if it would be easy to follow the odds all the timethe last one is the home level 4 which is about the same with the previous level but with intel about ship types also for each pilot
now you may ask what is the point why even touch local i brought this up because of id like to propose a better alternative than here has mentioned otherways its because you could be able to take advantage by getting better intel you could be able to blind your enemies by killing their intel source which could be fun in the middle of a fleet battle or home system you could sendreceive distress signals you could earn money by advertising and renting out your network people were forced to claim systems it would be an interest to populate 00 more than ever blind spots in space where anything can happen like in good old times recon ships would finally get the recon role imagine how many chinese farmers would die in the first week  alliances were able to decide who is getting free intel on local in their sovereign systems finally low sec could receive a nice boost guess other stuff toohere is about why i dont think all this would be a barrier for peopleand here are some thoughts about recon ships
please point out the run on sentence in my post sorry i have to be specific when describing my point or someone will say i am being to generalwas that a little easier for you and the goonie to understandalso you might want to check for typos when being sarcasticthey make your response look bad
yeah i couldnt find it either try using the return key next time
the runon was definitely mine
not a phoenix pilot but after reading up on this issue the problem seems very clear smartbombs used properly can make capital torps completely useless a suggestion made in the thread the op linked seems like a clever fix to this siege mode increases the hps of missiles by 625 or some other suitable amount of course simple boosting the baseline hitpoints significantly would work just as well
phoenix pilot hereive found on singularity that my citadel torpedoes do seem to be somewhat more effective when not fired in a volley but rather with a staggered firing time thats great against other dreads  they generally dont fit smartbombs the problem there is that its very easy for my target to negate that by simply staggering their own smartbombsso signedwere not asking for a boost to damage against subcapitals were not asking for a boost to fast targets were not asking for a boost to damage against structures though tbh there are some issues to be worked out for torpedoes fired presiege and preendofsiege what were asking for is simply a boost to citadel torpedo survivabilitya t1 large smartbomb will do 250 damage of its specified type whereas a t2 large smartbomb will do 300 damage of its specified type a citadel torpedo has 650 hp with 0 resists i assume since theres no resists specified that means it takes three large smartbombs kill a citadel simple t1 smartbombs will work great lets look at many carriers and supercapitals  theyll often fit three or four smartbombs when expecting to need to be anticitadel thats great but is there a drawback not really as someone else pointed out theres not much else to put in those high slots

yes this is an issue
this is quite clearly an issue that needs addressing
give em some love
reason i made it i got sick of trying to train up for something on sisi to test stuff out and when im almost there it gets mirrored

i just want to point out that ccp has a 95 chance of missing the fact that raising mass on all ships with the speed change is going to nerf black ops battleships even more by making the ridiculous fuel intensive jump bridge mod take even more fuel nerfing them even farther
i wish someone from ccp would comunicate what their thoughts are on the bo issues but theyve gone eerily stumm for quite a while now
i have to agree on that a nano gang can do much better then your black ops gang and you only need a prototype cloaking on the gang and they will be more affective then your black ops gang running around doing its dissaapear and reappear act you havent changed anytning except make a battleship more expensive and giveing it a really cool name a rapier and ships like it will see more action if you make a black ops bs it needs to be able to the kinds of things regular tech i bs can not do a recon is much cheaper and more depenable and can do a great deal more of then a blaock ops ahip can ever hope to do the way it is now because it can do everything a recon can do and the fact it has a bs hull configuration makes it worth 800 mill i really expected more from something that wouls cost me 800 million iskwe already have a role for that and its called a recon wich you can get for 80 million isk or cheaper from your alliance most likelytry bending the role of a bs instead of giveing us a nerfed ship recons can figt solo why not the black ops  and some extra turrets and plus all of its smaller recon counter parts abilities and thats wil definately be worth 800 mill iskor tyake them to a nouther extreem if they are not ment for pvp because other ships with the same role are cheaper and can do it better
yeah stick the fits in an easily accessible formattxt should be sufficient since each module has a unique name and have it load them from a subdirectory of your your eve directory itll get included in the next eft release im sure this is a very good idea
i like this idea but i think it might be better implemented as part of the manufacturing tab you can set it up just like a blueprint run use the instruction sheet as a blueprint punch in how many runsships you want to fit and it removes the items from your hangar and starts the job like any other one i think in order for balance doing it this way would actually take longer than if you did it manually but it frees up that pilot to be doing other things it also seems like doing it this way would lessen the server loadafter all we are supposed to be super rich pod pilots i shouldnt have to fit my own ship i have people to do that for me
storing these clientside sounds like a good solution especially if it allows eft to utilize the files
yes please 
fantastic idea
yep  even better for those of us with rubbish memories who have to figure out their fit all over again each time
yesss
signed
in case of database problems i could imagine this feaure purely on clientside clients save xls flie clients load xls file players will solve the rest
gets a thumbs up from me
would be awesome
againsti guess i still cant see the value of nerfing webifiersand anyway perhaps some ships can still go too fast but nanoships were a problem when youd actually see them being used theyre not really that common anymorei hate to be cliche but i agree  stealth caldari boost theyre not really affected by it at all  but therein lies the problem caldari is not supposed to be the best pvp race they are a fantastic gang racekeep it that way ccp dont blend everything together i want real reasons based on play style to pick one ship over the other not just because of how it looks in space

changes need to be made the proposals on test however are too drasticone thing at a time in my opinioni like the scram turns mwd off ideai think that nanos and polys should stacki think that ods and aux thrusters should stacki dont think ods and nanos should stack they affect completely different attributes of a ship drop that bit and the change gets a bit more balance imo
i have 2 chars with 4 clones each with a head full of snakes
i like some of the ideas already although the dual skill training is still one of the highest topics discussed it would be wise not to over complicate it 1  your dual training2  you dont always have to penalize for every bonus3  dont make something then attack it with the possibility have haveing future problems in other words dont nerf something that was made to simplify something or just scrap the idea why not have the the faster skill train slower like you said but have the slowest skill slightly accellerated since they are intertwined in that sence it would be wiser to take advantage og both side rather then one side dominates all on this matter but thats just me makeing things simple it is only an idea
it was concluded that ccp will look into a solution for this issueccp this is a nonanswer are or are you not going to do somthing on this issue more importantly if you are when are you going to implement it this is by far the most annoying problem with eve logging in just to change skills rarely is more than annoying why not make it easier for people that way you might actually get more customerswe dont need an unlimited skill que we just need one that allows us to sleep through the night go to work or god forbid have a life outside of this great game i support the idea of having a primary and a secondary skill que where the 2nd one starts when the first one ends then just to prevent people abusing the system stop the queskill training if the account stops payinghad this system been in place i would have continued to pay during the month and a half that i was away on business and didnt have a strong enough computer to actually log in as it was i just trained the longest skill i could find and then stopped paymentcome on guys please do this its amazing that you have so many people complaining about enacting a skill que for so many years and yet you do nothing are you trying to satisfy your customers or not
sounds like an interesting idea to me supported
you know i actually quite like this suggestion it kinda makes sense it would probably help lag in huge fleet battles where it would say that a certain amount of an alliance is in system rather than each individual pilot in systemsigned
i can see that big alliances and corps would make a good use out of this suggestion controlling all or parts of local intel and comms but small player groups newbies and the average occasional miners would be completely fdno support
brutuusyour opinion is one sided a bit i think you missed some pointslets see a situation where a small corporation attacks a borderzone of a big alliance where the allaince has sov level2 so the continous intel level is on the second level the small corporations recon ship enters the system launches the best probe she has and receives intel on level3 for the pilots whole network until probe is alive i dont see a disatvantage here it could be easier to surprise those who think are safenewbies and average occasional miners would be forced to work in teams and learnadapt i dont see a problem here either this is not wow noobs die in masses anyways no matter whatin 00 the groups you mentioned cant expect a glorious future anyways like 90 of them not even with the current local mechanics if your concern is about low sec with this system players could settle down more easily by hard work or good connections  high standings they could have a nice intel resource there so they could organize their self defense enjoy better security than ever just think about distress signalsif you say the main problem is that all this isnt free then id like to see what do you do if all you have is a constellation channel 
small gang and solo players do not necessarily get into disadvantage with the proposed local change if they go to big alliance territory to do their stuff they will be in disadvantage of course in neutral areas tho like no mans land where noone has intel or in faction sov areas they will have the same chance as anyone else with the difference that intel is delayed for both parties if one has good faction standings he may even have advantage over the newcomers example serpentis agent runners have higher serpentis standings so they get better intel about local in serpentis controlled systems than the random ganker
hmmmcould make the whole ecmeccm thing more exciting too having shipsskills that allow folks to hack networks for infodisruptionill give it a thumbs up
i really like this ideasigned
the whole point of a local nerf isnt a massive boost for 00 alliance but rather as a nerf for 00 alliancesnot supported
actually i want local removed for rp reasons you think a local nerf would hurt large alliancethis is the strongest alternative ive seen so far everyone in highsec gets access to concord intel everyone with faction standings gets access to lowsec and npc 00 intel sovereignty holding alliance gets intel and can give it to those who have good standings with them allies just like setting up who gets shot by pos gunsmaybe not as complicated as you have presented but something along these lines that separates chat and inteledited forgot support
i sense a slight contradiction here and since when is republic military school is a 00 alliancebtw supported
thx for the summary and support ofc the only aspect i missed from it the small corporations and nonterritorial entities also have their chance to get an own source with some recon ships they can have an own mobile intelnetwork quickly easily and cheap
very interesting even if this is just a beta version of what local could be i still support this alternative or something like it being pushed forward
i like the idea would like to see ccps opinion of this and other local nerfs
a good idea for setting up the bounty hunter profession if nothing else this will be a far better bounty system than what is implemented right nowas for agressors not being able to accept merc contracs although i understand your reasons for setting it up this way it just will not work as has been mentioned before you can not stop the agressor in getting merc help outside the ird approved system so you might aswell let both parties have acces to the system
support the nanonerfhowever dont destroy blaster boats in the process
holy  youre pretty dumbcould you please not get any more ideas about 00 space or alliances because its obviuos youve never even been in either 00 space or an alliancethanks
ankh honey i know youre trying but some of these simply prove that youve never been to 00 for any serious length of timei like the idea but id find it hard to make it not abused for isk id be more for a roaming agent that goes into 00 once in a while than a static 00 agent in alliance spacethere are agents in 00 but not in conquerable space just like you cant form a corporation in conquerable spacegreat idea but very little practicality the moment you allow playerspecified goals is the moment you allow 90 a large percentage of playercreated missions to be griefers looking for an easy gank along the missions parametersabusable if you already know of pos locations then why ask someone else to go locate them and if you dont know the locations it takes 30 seconds to find it with a probe or 10 or 15 minutes at the most to find it without if youre very poor at using your scanner chances are that it would take longer to get to the target system unharmed than it would to actually scout the target starbaseperhaps this would be a useful mission but i cant see it adding any extra depth than currently and it would be easily abusable by spies noting that the missions been taken and simply telling the defenders to defend that starbase currently alliances are able to form gangs and get to the target system before telling their gang the purpose of being in target systemsame as raidmaybe again i cant see it adding much more depthcourier contracts are just as effectivethis might be useful why limit it to minerals dont limit it to alliances or their spaceoh i like this one again dont limit it to alliances or their space
im afraid that this one is probably the least useful youll have people sitting bored for y hours which is not funthis would probably be no different than search and destroy but with limitations limitations are badeasily abusable make sure ship x gets from verysecurey to verysecurezjustonejumpaway and make lots of isk from continued success and people wouldnt use this if theres any decent chance of failure since they wouldnt want to lose the mission ship and lose the missionid have to see the implementation before agreeing with it it could easily be abused easily be useless or even bothblockade could be the most boring of them depending upon which system and for how longtbh im all for personally owned starbases but i think that consumed trade goods would probably rarely be used id rather see fixes to a lot of starbase things than consumables added to outpostsin all reality alliance space is much too dynamic to allow for many of the player created missions youre suggesting in my opinion i do like the idea of industry missions though contracts are far too limiting there to be of any use without a significant risk of scams
your slogan for joining the csm was that youre just a little everyday person in an npc corp for the masses of people still in empire or something to that effect i dont remember your exact words what are you doing presenting options and changes for 00 if youre trying to represent empire folk if youre asking that then its obvious that you need a little perspective just as youve challenged yourself to gain rank 10 factional warfare status in under a week i challenge you to join a competetive 00 alliance for 3 months and actively engage in alliance operations mining production the easy parts moon mining and reactions the easy and boring part setting up starbases the boring part hauling the stressful part roaming the fun and stressful part and starbase warfare the fun stressful and expensive part if the alliance you choose does not do 23 of those then they are not competitiveonce youve gained perspective then you can decide how valid you really think these changes are
youll note that i didnt post in support merely asked for clarification it would encourage less blobbing however as fleet commanders would quickly learn that the best way to gain a decent reward in this system isnt to drop 10x the number of ships needed to take down the pos and keep the fleet off their back in the process as by doing that the reward gets diluted down so much that each fleet member is barely covering the costs of their ammolost shipsinstead theyll take what they need as thatll mean a better individual payout building up their experience of smaller scale fleet ops by maximising the efficiency of each ship in the fleet rather than using tactics akin to swatting a fly with a thermonukeperhaps setting it as a mission wouldnt be such a good plan instead how about letting an alliance set a bounty like a concord bounty on enemy structuresships payable only on destruction of said structuresships only achievable by nominated mercenaries and members of the alliance that set the bounty that would make things easier for paying mercenaries for example and could have knock on effects that increase the effectiveness of empire mercenary companiesfor example corp x has declared war on corp y corp y being a industrial corp decides to hire mercenary corp z to fight this war setting a payscale of 1000 isk per shuttlenoobship 10000 isk per frigate 50000 isk per destroyer 100000 isk per cruiser 250000 isk per battlecruiser and 1 million isk per battleship destroyedjust brainstorming these ideas likely have huge flaws that i havent thought of at the moment and likely belong on a different issue thread
there should be capital mining lasers
i agree with the op as do i agree that if this is to be implemented the scanner would need some kind of overhaul
agreedbut i can see a problem imagine jumping into the constellation which houses jita and having the constellation chat window update everytime someone jumps into that constellation 3000 people in a chat channel spamming away while it updates with portraits from the hundreds of players leaving and entering the constellation from loads of different gates in different systems at the same time would frankly be very annoying and id imagine a little bit laggy i think it can work though maybe10 to 01 space  local chat is in immediate mode and constellation chat is in delayed mode00 space  local chat is in delayed mode and constellation chat is in immediate modei think this would work because the amount of traffic in 00 is considerably less than empire it would work with the risk vs reward factor aswell lowsec would as it is now would be more dangerous than 05 however not being able to use local as a tool in 00 makes the dangers of 00 higher with its obvious higher rewardsit may need a little bit of mapping to make sure all 00 space does not have lowsecempire systems within the same constallation though i think this is already the case
hello citizens of evei have read a lot of good ideas and a lot of problems and trust concerns i cant solve these concerns but i had bridge the the gap between stock  trust issues in my corporations  alliance here is how i did itaces guidelines let me address some issues one at a time and i promises you will have fun with stock options within the game and at the same time help you avoid some general pitfalls or hazards 1just as in real life stock markets and stock are only as good as the ceos and their directors and are maintained in a free market currently in the game only alliances can act as advocates or policing of scams within a alliance setting if a corporation is just selling random stock on a forum there will be no accountability to anyone real life markets are financial alliances all over the world this must remain true in eve for the game to function as a free market 2 why does a corporation want to sell stock normally to raise money for the corporation for investments in bigger than life projects agreed upon by a group of individuals3 good stock practices a corporation which is selling stock also should be awarding free stock to employeeslike loyalty points defenders miners and people who are helping the alliance as a bonus program without stock award programs stock will lose its value and the purchasersstockholders have no way to recover their loses in real life employees are awarded stock options this has to be true for the game too your best investors will come from within the alliance or group 4 dividends in real life dividends are award to the stockholders every 90 days if the corporation declares a profit in eve this should be paid every month with a disclosesure mailing list for all stockholders if no dividend is paid the ceo should still print a disclosesure with a reason why no dividend is paid example for no dividend payment is war or industrial mishap 5 stock value any corporation selling stock for more than 25 millisk for a shares is a poor risk unless there is a tracking system of dividend payments disclosesure statements and out of alliances stockholders which can be verified as nonalts in general avoid stock over 25 millionisk per share this will limited your losses6stock typeshelps secondary market sales in real life stock comes in many types examplepromissory stock stock stock option etc in eve make the terms of stock types easy for nonfinancial players first stock branches a municipalall executor corporations b civilall private corporation without a director or ceo in a executor corp stockissue types 1new issues stocksold directly from a corporation 2memory stockplayer selling stockholdings and 3award stock or also called bonus stockfree stock issued to a player for services or killmails or for being active etc 7secondary marketthe real player value to assure a secondary market of stock for players who wish to sell award stock or memory stock its the ceos responsibility to limit the sale of new issues stock sold to anyone individual to 3 of the corporation shares there stockholder can still receive award stock but must seek new purchase stock from current stock holders know as memory stock8trust issuevalue for stock to work you need a ceo which has appointed several directors who can sell new stock for his corporation stock sales must go into the corp wallet and serve the great good of the corporation over any individualthe ceo must hold 51 of new issue stock but only use his vote as veto vote in rare cases otherwise should not vote the ceo must return two out of three dividend payments to maintain the corporation financial stability if the ceo gos inactive the directors can still split stock and reduce the ceos stock holdings to less than 1 award issued stock percent equal to each stockholder shares value to maintain stability or in case of a director going rogue and stealing a ceo will still maintain the 51 of stock within his corp to firer the director and bleed that rogue shares down to less than 1 and than award equal value back to the share holders over time the ceo must issue more that 51 of all shares to the public when maintaining majority shares within his corporation this will assure a democratic system for your stock votes if a executor can turn his alliance corporations into stock companies the alliance will have dividends to fund it instead of fees this will create a mutualfund effect investing players which leave your alliance or corporation in seeing your group do well in the future assuring there dividend payments any player who turns hostile can have there holdings reduced at anytime i invite all of you to join us to learn the program cash warbash judgeadvocate general legal agent
in ending corporations stocks work just the way it is leaderships is the issue some better tracking is needed but its leadership that makes it all work i would not be happy if the stocks options had a major change loyalty is earned through duty and honor cash warbash judgeadvocate general legal agent
looked to me like the proposal was to move all l4 agents to 00 that would make them the new static plexes more or less though admittedly not as rich it does in fact provide another way to farm and get rich in 00 again its a freaking game so when you vanquish your 00 rival you want for there to be nowhere for them to go youd like them to spend the next three years trying to claw their way back up with the l2 agents and veldspar poprocks that would be left in empire we ought to just go straight to perma death no they could probably train a whole new character up in the time it would take them to be ready to attempt to take 00 space again the only alternative that theyd have would be to join up with someone bigger then that fish gets swallowed up by a bigger one and so on till you have two entities in this game in case you havent noticed the concentration of power is breaking the game already servers cant handle it you sure thats a process you want to accelerate i have lived in lowsecnosec as an individual in venal no less i know its possible and frankly not even that hard i also know its wholly unattractive to the typical empire dweller they wont go bud if you try to force them by turning empire into a ghetto theyll just bail it does not bode well for the long term health of everybodys game
hahahahah maybe i should stop ratting in the best systems because 1 faction spawn every 4 hours in unheard of lawl i would guess i hit 1520 faction spawns and ive been in eve a year never seen an officer heres what ratting in 00 looks like when the belts are bad that 13mil payout is a domination general that dropped nothing of value so all you get is the bounty this is in a 10 system supposedly the best space in the game
ahh that i actually agree with that i was talking more on the last page about just nerfing hisec kill missionsnowhere for them to go when they lose theyre already pushed out of 00 sovereigntywise they could always go to lowsec as well the concentration of power is caused by sovereignty mechanics not by the fightingffs no one will be forced it just makes them earn less isk while sitting in hisec if they want to sit there and effortlessly earn enough isk to afford anything they want with no risk then eve is not the game for them ive never seen a game become more popular due to being dumbed down
people talk about their being missions in 00 yes some parts of 00 have them but the parts that do not have player controlled sov this means that all the new space and other places that are not npc sov have no missions missions make you more money than mining excluding the person who gets a faction spawn ever five hours i have gotten maybe 10 faction spawns in over two years in 00 i have mined all of the abcs and mercoxit none of these were better at making money than a friend who had both his mission alts run missions in high sec on npc corp alts if you guys are so agitated about the idea of not having you mission hubs in high sec try thinking about living where you cant run missions at all in the region you are in the supposedly best place to mine for cash or rat for money and you make less than the person who never leaves the protection of high security space moving the missions to 00 would up the risk for every one or create hubs of calm 00 where mission runners killed people who disrupted them heck im just ranting now
from the faq page on the official eve site
are you presenting this as proof of 1 needs to be tweaked because currently eve is not like the bold paragraph or 2 doesnt need to be tweaked because the bold paragraph says it worksi think we all know that 00 and mostly so conquerable 00 is supposed to be more profitable for the individual
i did that to quash the let them play the game like they want to theres nothing wrong with riskless isk printing in hisec crowd i did that so we can cut through the bull of people who understand nothing of eves core design and get more towards figuring out a solution of course if someone would like to present an argument that lowsec00 is significantly more profitable than hisec missioning then id love to hear it but im sick and tired of the wow attitudes
my  you are really unlucky i have got more than 10 faction spawns exploring in high sec heck i have got 4 or 5 faction spawns mining in a 05 system and have the slave implants to prove that btw i mine less than 2hours week on the average
this prove that you have no freaking idea where you talk about are you aware what will become with economy do you want your battleship will cost you like 500m or even moreif this happence noone will still mine damn veldspar in low or null sec anyway never actualy so long there is much better ores to get your isknot suported
the riskreward that really needs to be considered here is ccps by caving in to jealous neverdogoodshardcore players and nerfing highsec to the stoneage they risk a massive loss of subscribers among casual players and peacenicks and they stand to gain well nothing reallyotoh leaving things as they are they risk nothing and stand to gain a continuation of the upward trend of the last two yearsi know what i would do if i was a corp execnow i wouldnt mind a mild nerf to highsec missions like in the form of no salvage from npc wrecks in highsec i make easily twice as much iskhour from salvaging than from the mission itself on the good salvage missions and this would at the same time probably be a good boost to lowsec missions as salvage prices would possibly skyrocket but since ccp seems to operate on a stonage or status quo policy i rather oppose any nerf
so its the usual ccp will lose subscribers argument ccp wont lose subscribers if they nerf high sec removing salvage from high sec is a first step but it would hit new players harder than it would hit lvl 4 runners so its probably not the best idea better to remove bounties and loot from high sec missions
lets just bottom line this so this thread can die the horrible death it deserves and can go the way of the hundreds of other threads that have brought up this very topic and been rightfully ignoredlets for a moment go hypothetical and give the op everything he wants boom wave of the magic wand insert wavy lines fade to black all level 4s are in 00 and all level 3s are in low sec empire roids now produce littlenothing and cant efficiently be strip minedwhat happens now be honest here no i said be honestthe eve economy will grind to a halt or at the very least be an anemic shadow of its former self the eve player population will go down because of it and it will stay down and that isnt good for anyone pvpers pveers ccp you me nobodyto anyone who thinks that this wont decrease the player population to a degree that hurts ccps financial ability to further develop the game as quickly as it would have been otherwise you are seriously kidding yourselfbut i said i was going to bottom line it here and i think i already have for the game as a whole now ill bottom line it for myself on a personal leveli love eve i love playing eve but as i have played eve over the years my reasons for playing it have also changed i used to play eve for the adrenaline rush of pvp but those days are long gone i play eve these days to relax after a long day at work and lets face it if you relax out in lowno sec sooner or later you dieor let me put this another way i live in empire these days and i like it i like it because i pay to play this game just like every other account holder this means that i want to play the game when i want how i want and for how long i want i dont like people screwing with my game time either in real life or in the game itself that is all 80 of the people do out in lowno sec ie screw with other people playing the game sometimes by mutual consent but more often notthis entire proposal talks of moving a major game activity that i admittedly enjoy from an environment where there are limited ways for people to mess with me while i play to an environment where there are unlimited ways for those same people to screw with my ability to do what i want when i want that is something that i will never support i am not going to pay my money so that someone else can screw with me its as simple as thatthe bottom line of this for me personally is this i pay my money to play this game for my enjoyment not anyone elses and there is no way to get around the fact that this is a not so carefully disguised way to make me pay so that someone else can have their fun on my dime nope not gonna happenpeople also keep bringing up the fact that this is about making the riskreward balanced so that combat in lowno sec is more meaningful this point is absolute crapif pvp out in lowno sec is so meaningless why do thousands of pilots participate in it everydaythe only other point that is brought up about high sec reward is that there is too much of it well if is so awesome and pays so much why dont the people complaining about it come take some of the isk for themselves instead of living out in lowno sec maybe cause there is plenty of isk out there final thoughts some people see eve as an unlimited opportunity fight and kill each other as many times as they can manage i found this aspect of the game appealing once but now days i more side with the crowd that sees eve as an opportunity to come together with my fellow players and build something meaningful that may last for time and doesnt have to do with vaporizing each othereve wonderfully accommodates both sets of desires that is one of its many appeals but if the op gets his way one of these areas will be severely diminished and eve as a whole along with itno support
the thing that moves money in eve is not missions its pvp ships get blown up builders buy minerals from miners and build ships missions just provide fast unlimited riskless money to buy ships thats why as one guy stated before nobody can cause massive loss for each other because you can simply build up you capital fast again when ccp nerfs missions in hisec economy of eve wont halt people who dont want to go to lowsec will become miners so more minerals some will go to lowsec more pvp sure we will see some minor decrease in playerbase numbers as some people will get back to wow but as ccp said not long ago if something becomes a mandatory in the game and lvl4 hisec missions became a mandatory in earning money in hisec then it needs to be nerfedyou see nobody gives a  how much you pay or what you want for example i pay for n accounts and i want that concord would be removed will this happen because i want it  i dont think so its not that missions give out too much reward its because it has too little risk or i should say no risk also using the problem to counter the same problem is not a solutionalso 
this is the most common argument used by opponents of changing missions but its a pretty big assumption not based on factual evidence but ccp said soandso many people run missions yes they did and it perfectly describes the problem missions pay out too damn much and thats why so many people run them lower the rewards and people will find something else to do some will quit sure not many and neither the game nor the economy will hurtno this point is spot on if isk is plentyful enough in high sec there is no reason to seek it in unsafe space low sec becomes a glorified battleground where people go to have fun not to live not to prosper just to pew pew thats not what we wantbecause it is fun as youve obviously not read this or other threads about this issue im not surprised youve missed this the fact is that people who live in lownosec do run missions in high sec they do this because its the best quickest and safest way to make isk this is what is wrong with the situationthe problem with your view is that you want the pvp parts and the pve parts of the game to be separate ie you stay in high sec you dont have to pvp if you want to pvp you go to low sec or nul sec the point those supporting this thread are trying to make is that in eve the pvp and the pve sides of the game are intertwined and completely dependant on each other they should not be separate they should not be optional
man are people still on about thisyou guys do know that ccp isnt going to move level 4s out of high sec right people have been wrongfully on about this for years the most they might do is nerf their payouts unnecessarily again
well its a good thing you dont have a clue about what ccp will and wont do then innit
and that is exactly where i think you people go wrong what makes eve so strong imho is that it gives so many options you can do missions in safety in highsec you can do missions mixed with pvp in lowsec admittedly noone does it but that is not due to highsec being too strong it is due to lowsec being too weak you can just pvp you can get your thrills or you can relax has worked perfectly fine in the three years i play now why should it not work anymore all of a suddenand seriously if they just move the current highsec missions to lowsec the isk flow will be seriously upset direct isk earnings will be much lower due to people not running l4s at all or people using t2 crap instead of pimp fits at the same time the amount of resellers will go up quite steeply as people will turn towards that with their highsec iskies since mining is boring at least to just about every serious mission runner i know and lowsec isnt attractive not to mention the utter value crash on lp and deadspace stuffand if you really think that it would not cause a lot of players to cancel their sub you are out of your mind like it or not l4 missions in hgihsec are the very lifeblood for a large part of the playerbase those who enjoy pew pew but do not have the time for pvp influences or do not enjoy hurting other players while blowing stuff up and even if eve was originally developed by asshats for asshats the majority of its population these days is decent people with a live and let live attitude and eve is and should remain a place for both you and them
wtf dbl post
well see who has the clue in six months when the missions are still in high sec and virtually unchanged cheers troll
but its not perfect its not even true you cant do just the things you want in the current climate and barring extreme luck its impossible to survive on just pvp you need additional income and thats where level 4 missions become mandatory yes mandatory if you dont own great space you are better off running level 4 missions than anything else this is why they need to be nerfed ccp have themselves said that as soon as something becomes mandatory it gets nerfed this is now true of level 4 missions personally i feel that such a move would benefit the market the market is screwed up right now and a part of that is because people have too much isk much if not most of that isk come from level 4 mission running take away that isk faucet and the market will stabilize eve is was and always will be a place for a multitude of playstyles the problem arises when the playstyles are separated then you might as well play different games all playstyles should be mixed up in equal fashion this is why i support a rework of the pve system to make it more in line with pvp this is why i support a general nerf of high sec rewards to reward the players who take additional risks without messing up the economy a nerf of high sec and especially level 4 missions is needed for the betterment of the game it will not bring in a hundred thousand wowkiddies who wants to play eve  the massively online single player game but it will retain the old players keep the game in a niche and make sure it survives for years to come with a steady but slow growth as it has done since it started
so its a guessing game huh you getting nervous that ccp might actually wake up and smell the coffeewhos posts have provided more content in this thread yours or mine see ya troll
no nervousness here sensing a little desperation on your part with the way your posting the hell out of this thread though oh ill freely give you that one youre definitely a quantity over quality kinda guylaters
i always get the last word in when bantering with useless carebearsbtw how many people in your corp where are you located are you all active
meh the retort originally here was a little over the top you havent been that poor of a sport or for that matter deserve that much of my effortjust moving onoh and for everyone else yeah no support
no he want pvp and pve to stay balanced you and your friends want pvp to dominate everything you think pvp will dominate everything and no one will leave as pvp is wonderful but there is a good percentage of people that think that pvp is something that add spice to the game but that is not the only thing to do in the game as soon as you make it the only thing to do a percentage of them will let the account terminate no emo rage quit simply they will stop resubscribing and maybe check in 6 month or a year if something is changed or simply forget the game you are willing to gamble that the game will survive to the kind of changes asked in this thread i doubt ccp would
in any climate it is impossible to survive only on pvp if you arent lucky and very competentpvp dont produce anythingthe rewards from pvp are always taken from another player what produce new riches are the pve activitiesratting mission mining moon mining npc trading all the rest included building stuff and trade with players shuffle resources around but dont produce any new resources think about that before asking for the removal or heavy nerf of one of the resurce creating activities
itt 19 ers wants to do missions on a serious note i dont think the lvl4 missions are meant to be newbie stuff or all of highsec to be newbie area as some like to stay in highsec for all of their industrialtradingmissioning lives removing this would be removing a way to play the game for some which could make them lose interest and create a massive footbullet for ccp good luck getting it through
no i dont want that i want pvp to be a constant force in this pvp game yes but i would like additional options for industrialists to hurt their opponent without pew pew what i definately do not want is a game where pvpers are at one spot and pvers on another and never the twain shall meet it needs to be mixed up otherwise neither pvp or pve has any point well adding spice is what pvp should do however in high sec it cant as even the war system cant make anyone pvp unless they feel like it thats consentual pvp and in this game were supposed to have non consentual pvp for the record though as ive repeatedly stated i am not in favor of moving level 4s and level 3s to low sec that would do absolutely nothing imo instead i want to see the rewards of high sec drastically reduced that way casual players can keep doing what they do but they have no big impact on the market and they cant compete with people who put some effort into their gaming in my opinion its beyond a gamble its a necessity just as some kind of nerf to nanos was nessecary a nerf of high sec is too
no but i was arguing against the point that you can do whatever you want in this game and be equally rich thats simply not true all i really like doing is pvp and i cant limit myself to that i have to do a bunch of tedious stuff to be able to afford pvp i would never whine about that though because thats what gives spice to the pvpim not asking for a nerf of every resource creating activity just mission running i am asking for this nerf because the resources generated from mission running for a single player is exponentially bigger than any other source in the game this includes activities where the player has gone through a lot of effort to ensure his income like holding nulsec space resources should be generated on the frontier regions  ie unsafe space  then brought to and traded in high sec high sec should be pretty much free of resources this has rp reasons as well as game mechanic reasons there should be no rats no ore and no missions except courier missions i realise this would go too far nerfing new players so as a compromise the nerf should hit experienced players ie level 4 mission runners
what are you smoking dude i live in empire i do l4s for fun i make money from building and trading the income potential from the latter so outweighs the income potential from the former that it isnt even funnyeverybody seems to think that l4 missions are teh roxxor because the people who fly them get to drive around in a pimped out faction fit bs heres a clue they dont have anything else to do with their moneythats right l4 missions are their end game i have the equivalent of 100 cnrs tied up in some stage of production and trading right now so do many others you arent whining about that because you dont see itthey are go mine in 00 in a hulk for an hour run l4 missions for an hour refine your ore and refine your loot then tell me resources arent generated on the frontier its a drop in the bucket budl4 missions in high sec are having no impact on the game whatsoever other than giving people who do not want to pvp something semirewarding to do in the gameif you want to force people out of empire you need to balance it and make it apply to all empire dwellers in addition to gettting rid of l4s youd also need toban freighters in high secallow a player to have no more than 10 open orders in high sec stationslimit highsec manufacturing slots to t1 subbs class items onlycompletely ban pos anchoring in high secif you do all that youd remove the real money making thats going on in highsec empire would be a starter island where you spend your first month or two in the game and then leave it would also change eve into a different game than it always has beeneve has always been a game where you could live the civilized life in empire if thats what suits you or the roughandtumble frontier life if you choose to stay in empire you are essentially a pve player you dont develop any pvp skills but you can end up richly rewarded if you are a long time dedicated player that shouldnt changethis is essentially another in a long line of whines about the suicide ganking nerf it doesnt really seek to solve any real problem in the game including risk v reward because traderbuilders are rewarded far more richly than l4 missioners on an iskhour of play basis it just seeks to get all those cnrs out there where you can grief em i think ccp is smart enough to see through it
you have a point with level 4s being their end game how ever sad it might be but youre otherwise wrong level 4 running is the roxxors because it equals 00 ratting in wealth generating can be done semi afk and is completely risk free because of this many people who live in unsafe space run missions because they are so much easier and more profitable than anything you find in low sec and most of 00and i say it is more than a drop in the bucket a lot more this is a matter of contention which only ccp can prove or disprovebut the point is that they do have an impact on the game they dont live in a bucket they use the same market as the rest of us they sell stuff they buy stuff this means they are pvping but only when it pleases them and in a manner that pleases them meanwhile those of use not running level 4 missions are getting shafted this makes running level 4s mandatory to compete unless you have lots of great space and thats why they need to be nerfed to hell and back preferrablyall those would be nice but none are required nerfing lvl 4s is required if youde care to look you would notice that this issue is much much older than the suicide ganking nerf its not a matter of sore egos wanting revenge its about game balance
pvpers are rarely rich its impossible to pvp wihout isk the tedious stuff you are complaining about doing is doneto earn isk everybody has to do the tedious stuff its just that some find it exciting god knows how 90  of all isk making activities are soooo boring in this game if ccp make it easier for you to earn isk then this gives you more time to play the game increasing the grind for isk makes it harder for everybody not all lvl 4 mission runners are experienced or capable having 3 or 4 month old players in losec in their shiney new ravens is not good for themits good for you how long do you think it takes for a new player to earn the isk for a raven fittings and insurance and he can lose it in a heartbeat in losec thats a big loss for a 3 month old player to get over and chances are he wont go back to losec so he will be back to running lvl 3s and have his grind time increased grinding is bad for all games ccp even use it as a punishment when they make you grind your sec status back up if youve been naughtyi can understand why you would want 3 month old players in losec with poorly fitted ships spawning lvl 4 missions but i can also understand why ccp keeps lvl 4s in hisecimo 00 needs the buff
a 00 buff would help and accomplish the same thing but at the same time just put more money in peoples pockets causing inflation nerfing hisec accomplishes the same balancing act without the inflation
yes but this is the grind you are so vehemently protecting it doesnt matter where said grind is done if you are a mission runner who does nothing but run missions it shouldnt matter what it pays you play for the missions so you do them no matter what they pay if you do care what they pay you arent really a casual player who just wants to run missions you are interested in accumulating as much isk as possible in as short a time as possible with as little risk as possible this isk must be balanced against all other venues of isk making in the game right now its completely out of whacki understand the point youre trying to make youre saying if it gets harder to make isk less people will have isk to pvp with thats bs if everyone have less isk everyone starts flying less pimped ships this means all ships get a purpose and that everyone can still afford to pvp the people living in 00 will then have a clear advantage over empire dwellers they can afford the good ships with the good fittings they have earned this privilage by xing up to protect their space empire dwellers will manage just as well with t1 named fits to grind missions is a grind if you hold all forms of grinds as bad for the game then logically you should oppose mission running when you run lvl 4s youre not a noob anymore you are at the top level of pve in the game i know a noob can do it but the question is if he really should be doing it also it doesnt matter to me at all wether noobs go to low sec in their crap fitted ravens its not really fun to kill them so they might as well come in cruisers again in case you missed it i dont want ccp to move level 4 missions to low sec i want to keep them in high sec but nerf their rewards by 90 this isnt done to get people to go to unsafe space this is to keep the riskreward balance intactill let you take a wild stab in the dark as to how i make my iskthe guy above me explains why just buffing 00 is a bad idea
can this thread die now there is a space in the back of the room just big enough for itccp can not and will not move missions out to 00 for those that were around 152 years agothey told the player base sosomthing like we are not that stupid to shoot the cash cow so lets stop this and let this idea join the 200 threads of the same subject
why are you so eager to have this thread die are you worried that ccp might actually go through with some of the suggestions here and balance their game and nerf your play styleare you aware that ccp has said a lot of things in the past that is no longer valid no this thread needs to continue
maybe i dont want to see the numbers dropyou may not have been here 5 years ago when eve first started3000 players that is 3k not 30kthis idea was shot down before by ccp for that reason force paying customers into somthing they dont want to doand they will leave
well then why are ccp forcing me to pve when all i want to do is to pvp hell they force all pvpers to do this crap have we left yeah some of us but many remained so will you mission runnersalso times have changed mission running has become a problem it generates massive amounts of lag corrupts the market and skewes riskreward these are all problems that could cost a lot more subscriptions than ing off a few carebears would
its unlikely that the numbers wouold drop its not like characters that only do missions need much isk
thats one way of looking at it i suppose nerf everybody and increase the grind for isk because it doesnt matter what the rewards are to people who do nothing except run missions so again only casual players run missions therefore increase everybodys grind when people look to make isk thats pretty much everybodys mo denying it would be lying i disagree its completely out of whack its about the same as everythig else looking at the figures for mining in 00  ratting in 00 lvl 4 missions in hisec they all seem to average thats average not the best ores npcs or agentsmissions about 2025 million an hour and truth be told none of them are particularly risky i havnt seen any figures but i would hazard a guess that the highest payouts would be from low sec agents which hardly anybody uses i wasnt suggesting that people would pvp less tbh just that the grinding for safe isk makes it more likely i agree with you on the people in 00 should be given an advantage but then again saying empire dwellers will have to make do with t1 fits is an extremely biased view and is probably due to the fact you spend a lot of time there and dont in fact like the people you inhabit it with now your twisting what im saying to suit your own ends i think you know exactly what i mean when i say grinding  is not good 90  where do you get this figure from considering we both know that lvl 4 missions  ratting and mining in 00 are a piece of  if you know what youre doing and all of them pay about the same why do you think a 90 reduction is needed to lv 4 s when the actual risk v reward is only slightly less losec lvl 4 missions and datacores i supposethe guy above you is in one of the most powerful 00 alliances in eve they have huge areas of space that they are looking to rent they want people out of hisec everybody has their motives max
00 safety has to be earned hisec does not by that virtue alone 00 methods of iskearning should vastly outstrip the hisec ones its only safe if huge groups of people band together spend a load of time effort and isk into securing the area
level 4 mission running rewards are out of whack because they pay just about the same as anything you do in unsafe space they should pay less a lot less the reason for this is that people can run them in more or less absolute safety something unattainable in low sec and 00 if high sec level 4 running should remain as the number 1 source of isk farming in the game thats what it is right now id say more people run level 4s than any ratting and mining going on in low and nulsec it will lead to a continued influx of players into high sec this is bad for the system load and bad for the game its imbalanced pure and simplei dont think its extremely biased of me to say that people who wish to remain in complete safty should have almost completely no rewards its not biased mainly because im one of the ones living in high sec 90 seems about right to me but ill admit the figure is right out of my ass much like other figures banded around in this thread 90 is also the approximate cut in rewards that would occur if my wich of the removal of bounties and loot would come trueactually high sec level 4 missions and nothing elseedit ive suicide ganked a few times these last few weeks as i thought i might as well cash in on my sec status before the nerf got a domi control tower 4 hulks and assorted mods failed a few times too missed a caldari control tower and some other stuff because some guy managed to tank my overheated torp raven for 15 seconds when concord finished me off  and i missed a dg control tower when it blew up if thats your attitude this discussion is pointless as every poster in it is being dishonest and self serving i chose not to see it that way as its not true for me im arguing for a complete nerf of my primary source of income because i think it would be good for the game
i pretty much covered the risks and rewards in 00 losec and empire in my previous post so we will agree to differ there are still players who will go to 00 because its supposedly the end game and want excitement this game is still attracting the type of player who likes a bit more risk and adversity and i dont think that any of these type of player would change their mind just because its easier to earn isk in hisec yet again your talking about carebears your attempts to get at carebears by nefing their income would have a negative effect on more people than just the carebears i think your passion for nerfing carebears and your self professed hatred for them is clouding your judgementand the reason you run hisec lvl 4s is because you are looking for the fastest safest most lucraive way to make isk you are looking to reduce your grind time so that you can play the game but call for anyone in empire to have their grind time increased if thats your attitude this discussion is pointless as every poster in it is being dishonest and self serving i chose not to see it that way as its not true for me im arguing for a complete nerf of my primary source of income because i think it would be good for the gameyou have 2 acounts and have been playing for 18 months if you have been clever you already have enough isk to last you for years this nerf would have a minimal negative effect on you your dislike of carebears is so intense that you would cut off your nose to spite your faceand im just a whiney carebear whos only been playing for 3 months i suppose we will never see eye to eye max peace
yours an mine opinion on what is a reasonable change seem to be different as much as yours and mine opinion on the quantity of spice needed to make good foodmy impression is that your opinion is that some kilo of pepper will make any food better your constant hammering on high sec rewards drastically reduced dont speak of some adjustment but of someone thinking that cutting them to half is too little you seem to forget that the players need to get that first bs and that spending months climbing the ships progression while at the same time you are spending lots of isk for the skillbooks will deter most new players no game can survive on the veteran players alone
they can always you know go into low sec or 00 if they want that bs i hear its not as dangerous out there as some try to make out

hello allive put a lot of thought into this matter and heres what ive come up withthe rd companies will have another button in their stations that is sort of a clinic and maybe also with the major combat corporations in this clinic you can convert one form of livestock into another at a cost of both time and isknow as the gallente i am i manage to capture some slaves from coughblowing up an amarr transportcough being that i want to set them free i take them to the clinic and start training them in a new lifefirst vitoc is some insidious stuff and only a certain percentage are released from its grasp every time period day etc in the same way as with salvaging those that are freed are turned into freed slavesnext i take them through school to help them relearn about the basics of living after this step again randomized and costing isk and time they become touristsnext i choose a career path for them and some of them may be more apt to certain paths randomized although you might be able to do some brain scans to find out which neural path theyre most apt to take i can choose to turn them into a scientist a soldier an exotic dancer a janitor etcnow that they have a role i can equip them to special slots on my ship these people will give the ship a slight bonus in the forms of 123 per field and the size of the ship will determine the crew compliment soldiers might give a bonus to damage exotic dancers might give a 1 general bonus to other crewmembers scientists might give a bonus to targeting range or salvage chance etcthe possibilities are endless also through conditioning on an amarrcrapdari station they can be converted back into slaves then to elite slaves this opens up a whole new market on livestock reformers and there could even be skills that affect this
oh hi guys your freed just chill out in my cargo holdtravels through gallente spacejust kidding your slaves again fofofoits a oneway street otherwise it will be abused i think that making both changes possible but only allowing a change once is too complicated how does one determine the original state of an object why is this exotic dancer different from that exotic dancer free slaves is ok but you cant have both for this reason

we definitely need more rigs and a boost for the underused ones youre ideas on how to improve them are also very well thought out while reading them i saw several new ones id love to use as a rig producer and user i wholeheartedly support your ideas
definately good ideas for discussion and esculationyou touched upong the t1t2 rig problem ie why t2 rigs are underutilised the current situation where two t1 rigs since zero stacking pens are better than 1 t2 rig for less cal in some casesis frankly crazy this situation coupled with extremely vast differences in build costs between a t1 rig and t2 variety means most t2 are never built and used at alltake carearithron
our drones need love
i have had this issue as well and it would be nice if there were a fix skillmod etc to eliminate this if its a feature but some feedback would be nice to have
ill only support this if asteroid belts get the same treatmentmined the veldspar out of existance time to move on to another mining spot until its regrown
really or would that just be bobs pos people and other current players on the pos scene knowing theres a chance to find a high end moon noone knows about and possibly mine it for a while before the world comes crashing in would serve to bring many more corporations out to 00 trying their luckright now theres a finite amount of valuable moons people know where they are and know whether or not they have a chance in hell of taking them most of them stay on the same few hands and as a result the prices skyrocket
if you were to do this youd have to add more rare moonsif its random distribution how many good moons are going to wind up unfound sitting in backwater systems that no one goes nearyour not going to find more than 1 or 2 00 populations that will keep going out and scanning every friggin moon to see if something valuable has popped upor theyll write a macro to do it and general discussion will explode again
i agree with the op on all pointsgive us smaller alliances a chance to get some isk even in providanceuntill we are booted from the moon that is
i do not support making moon minerals moving about in any random or any other manner it just doesnt seem to make sense to me however that said i doubt that ccp will ever hurt the uberalliance isk printers but i will repeat myself and say that at a minimum moon mining needs to be opened up all the way to 05 and 06 systems sure those moons are crappy but they will help out some of the small research corpsside note perhaps a troll the absolute vehement opposition to any moon mining changes by the uberalliances really points to them as the true carebears who once they place their pos want to forever just rake in billions and billions of isk for no effort
a moon mining pos like any pos still needs to be defended and its not guaranteed that you have it forever one cannot say there is no effort involved an alliance that puts no effort into their moon mining loses their moonshowever i do agree it is disheartening that practically all moons have been identified and will never change under the current system that is but such is the nature of exploration once the features have been discovered in this case the locations of valuable moons there is nothing left to findedit added italics to clarify my position
stupid idea some things should be static so people can fight over them thats what eve is all aboutnot supported
the idea i posted is just something that popped out of my head it isnt about dividing the wealth because in rl the biggest countries hold the most resources and have the most money to spend there is nothing wrong with that in eve things are ok as they are now but i do think that moon mining and sov holding should be split up right now you got one structure a pos at a moon that does all tasks at once and that needs to be split up i think
yeah those damn paupers from switzerland monacco austria lichtenstein and the vatican etcetc sure dont have two pennies to rub together
well im hearing a lot of dissent against this idea by individual members of goonfleet what id like to hear is what the two goonfleet csms have to say on this issue as if this gets onto the csm agenda then their positions on the issue are whats going to matter likewise the positions of the other members of the csm on this issuegetting the arguements hammered out here will definately help save time during the csm meeting as most points will have already been covered leaving it to be a simple vote thenalso knowing the positions of the csm members would be helpful to various interest groups as theyll know who they need to convince of the strength of their case to get an idea raiseddropped
hehe from your posting history one cannot denyyou exist to vote
for me the bottom line is twofold for you goons that means 2 parts 1  keep all moonmining static there is no appreciable value to the game in making them random as stated by various folk in this thread2  open moonmining up to and including 06 systems granted these moons may not be worth much but it there is no viable reason these moons should not be mined as all the data on them is already ingameside note i still find it funny how defensive the big 00 alliances get when anyone even mentions how foolishly unballanced their private iskprinting moons are to the game but seriously maybe what needs to be looked into is makeing the top 4 moonmaterials only produce 50 or 33 of the lower end moonsnote i gave this a thumbs up mark as i believe this does need to be discussed in the csm meeting but i do not support moons being minedout or the materials being moved randomly eve is not that old of a game and in my opinion it would probably take hundreds of years to actually exhaust a planetoids resources
sorry that was just staring at me mocking mehighsec moon mining is also a terrible idea you would think it would open up these iskprinters to more people but think about it for a second who lives in empire most of the game where is it foolishly easier to make money empire what do you think will happen when the capitalholding rich get a whiff of new moons however low in value now open to them if you say anything but snatch every damn one up in the span of about 2 weeks you are an idiotand lets not even begin to talk about how that affects empire space suddenly you have deathstars in the middle of a pveonly areathe only result of this plan is a strengthened status quo and what may as well be an oligopoly for you pubbie scum this means economic dominance by a select few companies who will compete with one another until either a one company goes bankrupt or b the two companies come to an agreement and gouge the  out of pricesps moons are still not iskprinters please see prior posts
i like this omg im supporting an ank thread2 mission payout in lowsec and 00 needs improvement3 module loot has a negative impact on the economy by making t1 production obsolete and injecting too many minerals into the economy7 level 4 missions in their current form do not belong in highsecurity spacethe rest is ok but wont really matter much theres only so much you can do to make missions unpredictable they are just scripted boring events tbhi see alot of people who mistakenly think that pirates want more targets no this is no true pirates and ccp both want more inhabitants into lowsec and nullsec space i dont want waves of enemy tech 1 fit caracals and drakes do you know how boring that is to shoot we want corps to move in corps to kill us and force us out of existance but we want more interaction more interaction  more playerdriven fun and that is what eve is created aboutfrom point 7 you will get a lot of whiners saying blah blah i just casually play or whatever missions will still be kept but their rewards need to be balanced or they need to be changed drastically ie perhaps moved out of high sec space ccp wants people to be encouraged to leave highsecurity space not forced there is no reason why a casual player cant have enjoyment out of level 3 missions and i dont see why eve would suck just because it takes a few more months to kit out your faction cnr carebear machineif you can make as much as doing a level 4 as ratting in the best 00 and by far more than ratting in lowsecurity space then how is that encouraging people to move out or encouraging people to form up into groups and take on bigger challenges there will be a lot of people who will whine and quit over this but good riddance eve is a mmorpg and has no room for solo players that refuse all contact with other players go play diablo
so wait you wouldnt have onesizefitsall ubermissionsetups that could blow through anything quickly people might have to adapt how exactly is this bad
excellent ideas proposed here  i run a lot of level 4s in highsec and the main reason i dont do the lowsec00 missions is because i have to take in a ship that cant do pvp in order to survivecomplete the mission changing missions to have less npcs with abilities nearer to player ships would help this a lot and it just makes sense im going to post another idea i had to reduce the rift between mission and pvp ships  mission runners will definitely be more interested in lowsec missions if we can narrow this gap imho
without reading past the opening posts i can say i agree with all the points one exception is moving l4 missions to lowsec but i agree with your reasoning on that point also the other improvements will take missions to the desired state and no move will be needed
definately making pve fun would be a great move for eve pve in eve atm isnt fun its just sameol sameol and its too damned predictable needing to scramble your mission objective being able to ecm the rats having the rats act in a more intelligent manner all these would be greatim not sure i agree here we dont want to make mission running in lowsec or 00 into the new it profession it should be an option not mandatory i think a general nerf of rewards in high sec is a much better approachyes definately remove all loot drops from missions its a first step in the reward nerfdont know about this one as ive yet to try factional warfare im sure its an issue thouhm there are mining missions seriously though these could just as well be scrapped they are useless in their current forma problem for sure as it leads to the mission hubs we have today making it a more dynamic system where agents continuously move you around as you progress through their missions would make the whole system a lot more fun and a lot easier on the systemabsolutely right in their current form level 4 missions dont belong in high sec if the missions are to remain as they are when it comes to rewards etc they need to be moved into low sec and 00 a better option is of course to alter the missions so they arent quite as rewarding as they are today personally i figure a complete removal of bounties and loot would go a long way towards balancing them lps salvage and mission rewards can remaindunno how you would fix this unless you build something into fw or expand it somehow
your points  my thoughts1 great idea unfortunately ccp has been trying this for years i dont see them suddenly getting good at it in spite of what they claim is coming2 could care less what they do here why because they will never make the pay outs high enough for me to have a pve fitted ship sitting in lowno sec for as long as you need to have it there to run a mission gankers will eventually find you and you will loose more ships because you are pve fit and they are pvp fit than the missions are worth it will always be that way pve and nolow sec imo just dont go togther more power to the people who can manage it but not this player lowno sec is for pvp and that is the way it should stay3 i think this is a great idea as long as it works specifically like this illiminate t1 loot from the tables and have the same amount of named loot drop4 cant comment here i dont run fw missions fw as a whole really doesnt do much for me anyway5 absolutely agree mining mission improvmentsexperiments could lead to an overall improvment of the base mining process that has been needed for years anyway6 this is not the answer ccp simply needs to improve the functionality of eve to accomodate the load why should the player base have to make sacrificeschanges because ccp cant adapt to our needs7 absoulte bullshyt such a move will only serve to diminish eves playerbase potentially mortally wounding ccps income and ability to sustain itself in the long run why take the chance with such a drastic move ccp has nerfed high sec mission running income 5 times over the past 18 months drastically in some cases mission running level 4s in high sec over two years ago did produce too much isk compaired to the time invested but its not that way anymore far from it in fact leave it alone already8 neutral its always been that way whats the problemi support that these items get attention under the conditions i listed above
1 missions need to be made more dynamic and unpredictablecould be interesting to have the possibility of escalation build into some missions other possibilities could be to have optional objectives giving extra rewarda choice in how to complete the mission which have effect on the nextfinding a new agent within the mission2 mission payout in lowsec and 00 needs improvementperhaps make certain good missions only available through low sec agents3 module loot has a negative impact on the economy by making t1 production obsolete and injecting too many minerals into the economyyes it does get rid of tech 1 drops but increase lp and money rewards4 missions in factional warfare require improvementsmaybe put in npcs from both sides in the missions5 mining missions require improvementsi dont find them that bad but there is room for improvement6 agents are static resulting in overloaded mission hubs desire to have agent quality made dynamicthen i would rather prefer quality removed completely7 level 4 missions in their current form do not belong in highsecurity spacei think they do mission running is the biggest isk faucet in the game and as such needs to have unrestricted access for all players if established players could somehow prevent newcomers to even come near any kind of decent isk producing activity it would hugely widen the gap between those who already have a lot and those who have little this game design is needed as eve do not have a levelmaterial wealth capof course established players will in their own interest often try to promote gimping newcomers and the newcomers will not argue against them as they are not even playing the game yet luckily ccp has more perspective than that8 standing is being monopolized by missions no ways to get standing outside of mission running with the exception of fw standingthis would be nice especially a way to get out the black holes when your standing is low beyond repairi would also like to see agents especially pirate agents that could be found at static hidden complexes
i really dont think that i want to own any insecure items in this game except for maybe prostitutes and grad studentshowever i fully support unsecure containers
this definately needs tweakingi dont see the need for seperate containersjust disable auditing by default on all containersrequire people to enable auditing on the configuration options for the containerthe worst part of this problem is that a failed attempt to repackage the container makes a new entry into the log a premature attempt to repackage the container will force you to wait another 3 weeksthat and we need the option to export the logs as the ingame viewer just doesnt cut it
yeah a nolog station container to sort your stuff with without locking it down for two weeks would be extremely convenient
definately a good idea i know ive got a lot of secure containers dotted around various personal hangers from assorted moves like it was said earlier this cant be good for the database having to keep track of both the container and the associated logs for every single one of these especially when you should be the only person with access to your own hanger and so have no need for the auditing function for things stored there
wow i must not have very much stuff compaired to you guys i get by with general frieght containers i feel so poor now still some bigger ones would be nicesupport
its more the fact that the secure containers tend to be cheaper than an unsecured container of the same size either that or you get more volume usually 10 times as much for the same money by going secure
it would be nice since configuration between computers isnt even standardized i cant log into two computers and have it not lock my items
supporting this now that my main is back onlineperhaps once the 11 testing is done ccp could put this proposal on either sisi or multiplicity for some testing
beautiful and simple totally agree makes sense and is internally consistent with the other mechanics of the game re ability to activate modules in warpdrones could simply lose signal to the drone carrier due to warp interference for the duration of the mwd maneuver then reacquire it as soon as the mwd decyclesid like to see the base ship speed rebalancing thats occurring on sisi make it to tq simply because it makes senseas a final note the whole orbitingtracking thing is broken and makes no sense from a real world perspective if youre standing on the edge of a moving carousel pointing a gun towards the center of it you dont need to adjust your aim as it carries you around the edge of course thats an entirely different can of worms
sounds more reasonable than the alternativesigned
i support this change level four missions in high security space has no risk at all
while i understand what your trying to achieve their are significant problems to doing it that dont allow me to support a change at the momentfirst low sec and null sec dont have a hell of a lot of locations to run missions in so you are either in an alliance that owns that mission hub or your not running missions in low sec or null secsecond if 0 ratting is even closely similar to lvl 4 missions in high sec why isnt lvl 4 mission in 0 that much better than ratting belts in high sec fix that not nerf high sec that will give people incentive to leave high sec instead of forcing them to leave high sec if you force them to do anything they will just quit if you entice them to head to 0 with greater rewards then you give them an option of staying where they are or moving to riskier areas for higher rewards casual players will probably stay in high sec but the hard core mission runners probably wont then you put the people that generate insane sums of income in harms way without nerfing the crap out of the casual playeri would support a complete removal of loot drops from npcs as long as all factions had lp stores and all factions had comparable loot this means you can buy faction deadspace and officer modules from a factions using tags looted from missions this will significantly reduce the amount of minerals and modules sold on the market making mining manufacturing and trading much more valuable but lowering the prices of the uber modules while giving those same casual players access to equipment they can sell or use yes this will be the new farm but it already is a farm of sorts isnt it not to mention it could significantly increase the target status of high sec mission runners for their tags and the old reasons while increasing their risk of getting ninja lootedas pointed out by others if you limit the total number of missions an agent can give in a day then you will have all those missions done before half the player base log on for the first time limiting the number of missions a player can run is unrealistic simply because no one else has a true limit to the number of roids they can mine belt rats they can kill or players they can gank it might be regulated more but its not completely limitednerfing bounties or payouts for high sec is again forcing characters to go to low sec and null sec when those areas should be greatly boosted insteadno where does ccp state that eve requires players to play as a group engage in pvp or do anything at all for that matter a player could pay a subscription just to chat it up with folks in the noob channel if thats what they want to do so where people get this idea from that ccp wants eve to be a pvp centric game i have no idea
i would buy the store empty
want
oh sweeti belive ccp could make their isk back if they decided to do this
im all for it
supported alternatively the ability to set standings to the militia as a whole rather than having to find each and every corp that has joined would work as well
this is one of those things that i would assume would have come in with fw sometimes ccp makes no sense
i remember having a problem with this i flew in tlf and corps that were participating in gallente fw were showing as neutral
anyone who has dealt a lot with corporation hangars and corp hangar arrays chas knows that when it comes time to stacking items that are thrown in by corpmates without the proper roles can lead to a large waiting time for the items to stack if you stack the entire hangar in a cha with many items granted it should take time but it may take upwards of 3045 minutes before the items are unlocked and stacked during that time the items are unusable and it has to cause major lag in other hits to the database as wellwhat i want to see maybe an explanation as to why chas and corp hangars take so much longer to stack than personal hangers with the same number of items or from others ideas as to how to manage this downtime examples a timer progress meter an option for the cha to not have to check permissions for each item in each hangar for each person etcedit so my brain wasnt 100 there when i typed it at first and spelled hangar hanger my bad
wut i havent seen any hangers in this game
definitely an exploit in my opinion
any method of dodging wardecs should be considered an exploit or at least a bug and should be eliminated
instead of the currently proposed nerfs to suicide ganking why not just let players join concordcrimial flag makes gankers fair game to concord membershave the npc concord scramble more slowly and make them possible though difficult to evade players who join concord would get instant kill rights no podding on criminally flagged players that would include both gankers and flipperscollecting loot from ganked wrecks flags youyour buddy in the hauler can try to snatch and run but that will flag him just like stealing from any can concord players could blast himganked players can collect their loot without getting flaggedconcord players secure the area until the ganked player can return and collect whats left of his stuffconcord pays automatic bountiesthese would be based on the ship type of the criminal bs at the top frig at the bottom just like rat bountiesthis would do a couple of things it would give combat pilots another progression path im going to write about progression paths in another post after mission running other than pirating fw and 00 it would also put a lot more risk in being a highsec criminal without turning empire into hello kitty carebear island it might even make empire fun imagine that
make it possible for gankers to evade concordoklets you kill flippers not oki assume you mean suicide gankers
there really wouldnt be suicide gankers anymore cause it wouldnt necessarily be suicide it would just be really risky especially if there were lots of cops aroundand why not let a law enforcement player kill a flipper its a criminal activity if youre going to do crime better make sure there are no cops around or at least make sure you have enough backup that you figure you can kill them and get away
because its not a serious enough crime to warrant losing your ship
no what happens to the newb miner who tries to take their stuff back im guessing theyre about to lose their shippretty hypocritical to say that the flipper shouldnt be at the same risk if its not serious enough to warrant losing your ship it shouldnt flag you at all should just incur a minor sec status hit
holy crap i would totally join concord and just cruise around doing highsec pvp vs anyone who is flagged or who has a very low sec status it would be just like being in a faction navy except your enemy faction are people who are flagged or have low sec status awesomeedit and i could go into lowsec too and kill pirates without getting a sec hit or activating gate guns so awesome screw the bounty hunter crap i want this
not supportednot because i dont like the idea but because this idea hasnt really been thought through thoroughly before being posted i assume that youve basically just thrown your thoughts down without thinking through all the repercussions of what your idea would do to large portions of the eve playerbase with this one hit pirates hard and also with your other idea that youve proposed effectively completely eliminate mission running as a playstyle as its obvious that you havent consulted anyone else on these ideas by how rough they arefor such a major change in the games direction that youre proposing youd need to have hammered all the flaws out of them on the fi board at least by taking in what other players have to say about your ideas and using their feedback to eliminate the bits that would be a terrible idea only then should it be brought to this board in fine detail as to what your proposal actually ishaving said that i seriously doubt that youre going to get much support for these proposed changes no matter how much polish is applied as should they go through then the game wed be playing just wouldnt be eve anymore
hmmm i read the section description and i didnt see anything about going through the house select subcommittee before bring an idea to the floorwhat ive posted here are just alternatives to all of the move l4s to low sec proposals ive seen which i think is an awful idea if you do that you might just as well get rid of them youre not going to see 180 players running missions in a 3 system on a saturday night at least my proposals give players who dont want to pirate or move to 00 a way to make money thats actually viable running missions in low sec isnt but those proposing that they be moved there know that theyre just looking for more juicy ganktargets
not really if someone is globably flagged they are already a target for everyone anyway in hisec the uber concord of doom just kill you before anyone else does having players involved would open up the chance to beat concord if concord players go into low sec and shoot blinky pirates they are just like nomral people only they get paid to do it and thats a bad thing how yes because me doing my nonillegal activties in my lovely missions need to fear concord its an idea that needs work and alot of trail and error but the one area it will have major issue which you somehow failed to point out is factional warfare minmatar shot a concord station after all on the thinking it out side to make sure concord dosnt go over board simple say concord players can only collect bounites in 01s or above and simple standing requiements prevent everyone from joining from day one
did you read the description for the other forums as well especially in light of the dev blog on the upcoming changes to the forumsthis forumcurrent description  to raise topics for the attention of the council of stellar management and further election discussionsnew description  a platform for players to bring topics to the attention of the council of stellar managementfeatures and ideas discussion forumcurrent description  share your gamerelated features and ideas with the developers and the rest of the communitynew description  get feedback on your gamerelated ideas and suggestions from our developers and the rest of the communityso if you want feedback on your ideas for gamerelated changes which of the two by their descriptions do you think is more appropriate a forum for feedback or a forum for bringing a completed idea to the attention of the csm with a view to getting them to present that idea to ccp
it would certainly achieve the get more players to go to lowsec objective its just that theyd be pvp fit when they go and looking to make some money while kicking some ass perhaps thats not the boost low sec that some have in mindit would be really great to see half the mission runners in motsu say screw this did you see the bounties that concord pays where do i buy a warp scrambler and then see them head for rancer
looks to me like they overlap each other 100 except for the fact that this forum is for any idea that youd like the csm to consider and the fi forum is for features discussions specifically nothing there about the fi forum being like a subcommittee for hashing out ideas before presenting them to the highandmightyit could be that way you could make it so that ideas in the fi forum need a certain number of thumbs up before coming here aint that way though i see lots of ideas posted here that were never posted in the fi i see some of my ideas posted here that i did post in the fi without attribution i just figured id cut out the middle man
i was thinking about this and it seems to me that with this in the game moving l4s to lowsec might be viable in a typical lowsec system youd have the mission runners and miners the pirates looking to gank or ransom them and the concord cops looking to gank the pirates for the bountiesit might just make lowsec secure enough that the mission runners would go but still provide plenty of pvp with ships that are actually fit for pvp doing most of the fightingthe problem with traditional antipirating is that you go broke the pirates just plain have more income potential than you do this would balance that some and make antipirating a viable alternative
signedi think this would actually balance the game out nicely in high security suddenly the players now have the ability to enforce the lawreliance on ai has its limitationsbut only if this effects high securitykinda pointless for it to spread to areas where concord doesnt patrol
its not however it does open up a can of worms by giving a gcc to anyone taking from a can that doesnt belong to them for example im in a mining op with a noncorp fleetmate hes mining and im hauling for him lets say for sake of arguement that hes an alt of one of my corp members i arrive in belt next to his jetcan with 1 unit of ore in it he drops his hold into the can and i immediately take the dropped ore into my haulers hold that way dealing with a large proportion of the risk associated with mining via jetcan at this point im flagged as hostile as ive just taken stuff from his can he doesnt care as we plan to split the ore once the op is complete im just taking it back to stationhowever under his idea im now flagged with a gcc and so a valid target for anyone ive never flown under a gcc so i dont know what restrictions it places you under sentry gun fire cant dock but the most pressing of these would be that i can now be shot at with no repercussions by anyone simply for playing my part in a legitimate mining operation oh and i mistyped in my other post meant to say miners not pirates this would actually make pirates lives a lot easier sorry we seem to have crossed wires this idea was the one i was on about when i said it eliminates mission running as a profession basically he advocates the complete removal of lvl 4  5 missions and capping people at a maximum of 100 lvl 3 missions over the entire course of their eve career
understandable unfortunately with the lines being so blurred between the two forums it does make it difficult to know sometimes whether an idea would be better suited here or in fi the forums could definately use a lot more organisation ideally youd want to post an idea for discussion on fi then provide a thread here for people to indicate whether they think the idea is strong enough to warrent going into game so basically for the two threads theyd post here if they supported or post on the fi discussion thread if they were opposed while providing constructive feedback on how to improve the ideahowever thats a completely seperate issue which i believe already has at least two seperate threads on this forum
not exactly yes getting aggression flagged for taking from a jc that was outofcorp but infleet would have to be fixed it really should be fixed anyway but stealing wouldnt give you a gcc and make you a target for anyone under my proposal i would only turn you flashy red to those players who signed up to be law enforcement by joining concord it would probably be on the same timer as the standard agression timer 15 minutes if you can steal and evade law enforcement till the timer ran out youre clearstealing wouldnt cause the npc concord to scramble same as now it would just flag you to concord players ganking someone in high sec would both flag you and cause the npc concord to scramble same as now difference would be that the npc concord would be slower to arrive and possible to evade and would really only serve as backup to concord playersplayers who were gcc flagged would be legitmate targets for concord players anywhere they are flashy red of course they are to everyone now and would continue to be the only difference is that players who join concord and choose law enforcement as a career collect concord bounties for killing them same as the bounties you collect on npc rats and like them based on the ship class killed but probably larger due to the increased risk and reduced frequency of kills it should be scaled so that it pays comparable to l4s if youre good at itits just a progression path to entice mission grinders to move beyond l4s and derive their income from pvp rather than pveit might as i said above provide a nice rebalancing of lowsec so that it became attractive for pveers to go there again youd have some cops there and not just robbers
resolve this please free kug
those two are fairly simple especially considering the also missing ship modelsgallenteamarr rogue drone dominixcaldariminmatar thukker typhoonon top of that for the tier3s we could getkhanid abaddonmordus rokhintaki hyperionand well minmatar lacks another sidekick faction now if only ammatar were minmatar based in their combat gear not amarr based we could have an ammatar vargur
mUFFFDh khandid 3 missles no lasers love there  you would get an abbadon with 5 em damage for cruises and torps  the 5  resists  activly making it the perfect level iv mission runner 
meh my paladin can already hit out to 50km with multifrequency
hell yes
new ship idea are always fun and never a bad idea imhoas long as zulupark doesnt get a hold on this and try to prebalance them like the black ops disgraceanywho support
well without missile velocity bonus it would only be useful in pvp or for ratting imho they should actually revamp all the empire faction ships so they get 3 bonuses like their pirate counterparts fleet pest navy mega and navy apoc definitely could use the help cnr would have to get a minor thing as 3rd bonus to not make it overpoweredand then the khanid abaddon could be a real missile spamming armortanker with damage bonus not rof to be different from raven armor resist bonus and missile velocity bonus
the faction bs bonus is 50 hp check the stats it makes them ideal for passive tanking while the pirate shipsmarauders might be better off active tankingalso about the thukker phoon thukker is already in the game as a t2 producer p but yeah the rogue drones are the gallenteamarr faction i have no idea about the caldariminmatar faction though it could easily be the misc mercenaries you see in missions
signedit would be great to see some more faction shipsactually come to think of it whats up with jove ships models in the data files that region is inaccessible but exists and so do the jove ships would be nice to see those in game too they could be limited to jove region couldnt leave it or something

agree this should be a minor change ccp get on it
sounds sensible and perhaps make a note section available at acceptance time  im sure plenty of people would make good use of quick notes like sponsored by  or probation until 
theres usually no shooting involved you can go into someones mission speed ahead of them and kill the end guy and then take the missioncritical loot since you killed the end guy the loot is rightfully yours and you dont get flagged to the missionrunner depending on who you ask this is either an exploit or not an exploit it is one of those things that you cant defend against though and as such i believe it should be deemed an exploit
i dont think the rules are at fault here i dont know why a gm would deny your petition for a mission reset if its time was about to run out and really you werent experienced enough to handle it i can take a 04 hit on standing there was a time when i couldnt if you were already running level 4s to heck with you
it would be an exploit if they werent flagged for theft because the person accepting the mission owns any wrecks from that missionhowever odds are low that they will be able to find an exploit to bypass the wreck ownershiptaking mission specific loot is the same as taking any other lootdeal with it
it is against the rules to steal mission sensitive items it falls under harassment petition it and gms will take care of it
or not as the case was for someone in my corp
why the heck would someone want to steal mission sensitive loot when its something you can find all over the placethe idea just seems well its just flat brain deadpetition the gms to deal with it theres no reason to change the game for something as pitiful as thateven then how did they get there in the first place its too expensive and time consuming to troll for dead space you must have fleeted them or something and they took off leaving your fleet or somethinggranted im grasping for straws but the point is still the same this is juststupidthere are far better things to loot  o p
its fairly simple1 eliminate local2 introduce a new revamped constellation channelin this new channel you do not see anyone but rather you see numbers based on several factorswith a simple selection boxshow me stats based on standings from1 my player2 my corp3 my alliance4 my militiainside the new constellation channel you see the following numbers based on your selections1 neutrals2 hostiles 3 friendlies4 outlaws5 war targetseach give a current number based on who is in your constellationthoughts changes
eehrr  some people actually love to talk in local  some of the most fun ive had in eve was while talking in local with other people no need to fix local  i just works fine 
then keep local as just a chat channel when you talk you show up but otherwise you are hidden
imagine how long it would take to find a pvp target eve is not like other mmo games where you walk into a small dungeon and shoot someone space is quite large and what is so bad about local it helps you find people who might even want to test their strength and agree to a friendly pvp matchjust keep the local what it is now and if you dont wanna pvp dont go to 00
if they will remove local a lot of ppl will go to lowsec0  and i cant imagine how the hell will smaller alliance defend their space while they will not be able to se incomers
i actually dont mind local myself im just trying to find something to settle the crowds i think a change could make some new interesting battles only because ive seen too many failed attempts at good fights when local changes and the cockroaches run like the light just turned onhaving a constellation chart showing numbers and standings would lead to some fun explorations and trackings to find targets
only if there was some kind of tool that let you scan in different directions oh wait
at fanfest last year they said it should up and running by 3rd q this year well its 3rd q and theres no word on this topic i would like to know more details about this topic
truth is that jita is run on dedicated commodore 64
sorry they picked teh fish tank instead
not just jita whole game running on that console
im curious out of complete geekiness the fact that 40000 people can play on one server at one time is one hell of a feat and i would love to hear about new hardware and how it will change the game
hardwere will dont change anythingjust rewrite the sourcode will cos this python dont support multi core server cpu
what lag
silly they didnt pick the the fish tank instead the fish tank is an important part of the super computer it will be used as the heatsink for the super computer what better use for a 2000gal7500l tankfor those of you who have no idea about the fish tank here is some linkage
sure if you count 45 minutes to load grid and another 45 minutes to load ships as playing   disclaimer  not experienced this myself but enough of the nulseccers have whined about it here i almost feel like i have

or just remove all of them
theyre fine people should not be immune to attack while near gatesstations gatecamps exist to give a disadvantage to the camper in a fight and to stop fastlocking ships from scramming people down in camps at least without remote sensor boosting
if you consider around 1000 dps as mnothing good luck p
for real you can kill pirates by zooming around them in an interceptor while the gate guns hose them if they are solo they arent to be underestimated
gate guns do maybe 600 effective dps total  i neither support nor am against this but if you are talking ab out it you can at least get your numbers right
once those types step dpwn they can not re apply because this will give other participants with ideas to implament rather then the same dominent direction from the same relected member unless there is not too many participants comeing is to take on the same challenges then where is this topic headed 
at times in the heat of battle i miss some info just cause i do not look in the screens bottom especialy when i try to locate friendlies or hostile in my sorounding space what i propose is a 34cm cycle be placed around the mouse cursor split in to two heimpspheres one showing shield status and one armor it should have a different shape or color when an armor or shield repairer is on consider this as a semi transparent piece of info cauge following your mouse movements after even if we fail to see at some important to us piece of info on screen we all know were our mouse coursor is and such an info carrying object would be a great addition also it would make sense that this would be a mode depentant addition meaning it could have other additons when mining or looking in market window and such be well

its busted right now pve pays and unless youre one of the rare players who achieves financial success through pirating or a chokepoint gate camper in 00 pvp costs there needs to be a professional progression for combat pilots that lets them make a good living at it and every branch of that progression should lead away from pve and toward pvp lets face it eve has no quality pve content for combat pilots it only gets played cause its an isk grind the isk should be where the fun is you shouldnt have to choose between making isk and having funheres the progression i have in mindphase out l4 and l5 missions make l3 missions limited runa new combat pilot runs l1  l2  l3 x 100 missions once he has run his 100th l3 mission his agent congratulates him on his progress as a fighter and explains his options for continuing in the combat pilot profession they are law enforcement bounty hunting crimepirating faction soldiering mercinary private soldieringlaw enforcementbasically you join up with concord and hunt down criminally flagged players in empire space concord pays a bounty for each criminal brought to justice on a sliding scale based on their ship type and how negative their sec status is i described this in detail another post this profession pits you against the criminalsbounty huntingwe already have a thread going about this one but basically you collect player placed bounties on other players the mechanics just need to be cleaned up so that its not readily exploitablecrimepiratingdoesnt need much explaination you try to victimize other players and evade law enforcementmercinaryyou join up with a corp that accepts mercinary contracts through the contract system usually to join an ongoing war between player corporations on one side or another there are already some good ideas about this one toofaction soldieringyou fight for one of the factions as a privateer they pay you handsomely in both isk and war booty for net systems taken and heldprivate soldieringneed to provide a mechanism by which corps and alliances can automatically pay their soldiers probably set up a pay scale and rank system that pays combat pilots for kills based on ship type and their rank within the corp or alliance make the corpalliances pay scale for combat pilots visible like their tax rate is now competition is a good thingthe pay scales for the two npc based professions law enforcement faction soldiering should be set so that they can pay comparable in iskper hour to what l4s pay now for someone who is good at it that will set the bar and provide competition for the services of combat pilots and require that those who are paying bounties or trying to attract pilots to their corp or alliance are paying them enoughimagine an eve where you get paid to pvp and you dont have to resort to mindless npc grinds to fund yourself let carebearing be for the carebears and combat pilots get paid to pit their skills against other combat pilots i want to play that eve how about you
most of the stuff you mention allready exists 00 pvpers make money rattng most of the time  criminal huntingmissions are pve  nothing to do with pvp you can make some good isk ganking haulers mercs are allready ingame and pay prety good faction soldier stuff  mission runningthe private soldiering stuff might work  but if corpsalliances really want to help their pvpers they allready do it in the form of cheaper ships 
i was talking about player criminals ratting is just a mindless grind and under my proposal theyd really only be for new players yep thats the criminal profession i spoke of only difference is youd have a law enforcement profession too to balance it out and provide some risk yep about the only change id recommend is bringing the profession into the contracts system to help facilitate it no faction soldiering is factional warfare right now it doesnt pay it should faction soldiers should get a substantial payout for net systems taken each week comparable to what they could make running l4s difference is its primarily pvp based instead of pvemost alliances do jack for their pvpers while their leadership gets filthy rich and berate their pilots because theyre out ratting all the time instead of pvping this would make alliances compete based on what they were willing to pay their combat pilots those who paid well would get morebetter those who paid less well you get what you pay for
first off you think pve is not fun and just a grind however i know a few people who actually enjoy the pve side of things to phase out pve would basically remove 1 type of player from the game reducing the total number of players and remove a nice target for some of us other peoplei tend to feed and make my isk off the mission runners in high and low seclaw enforcement if some one is flashy you can kill them you dont need to join up with concord to go hunt those who have broken the laws and you get paid by the loot dropped off these criminalscrimepirating again already in the game just go do it why does the game need to tell me it is an optionmerc work again a lot of corporations already do thisunder private soldiering the person assigned in the alliance to make payouts can check the kb and make the appropriate pay out this works well as long as the player posts hisher kills if not they dont get paid their problemfor the changes i did not address i do not have enough data on them to commenthay i do play eve where i get paid to pvp and i get paid very well
most if not all of these mechanics exists in one way or anotherand you cant just yank missions out from under empire pve vets
yeah your 35th angel extraviganza is edgeofyourseat thrills ill tell ya which is the basic problem with all of the move l4s to low sec proposals mission runners are just a mark if they stay they belong in highsec where they are as i laid it out that profession would be an alternative to the nerfs currently proposed for suicide ganking and it would provide a real alternative grinding l4s sounds like you gank mission runners for a living i agree it pays and would pay even more if the move l4s to low sec whines are heard wed have to agree to disagree that that is pvp i think pvp is trying to kill someone who is also able to kill you ganking is something different it pays but its not attractive to many folks
most of them exist none of them are really a viable income alternative to l4s or you would see less people running level 4s and more people doing them they need a boost income potential wisei personally agree strongly that there are some folks who just want to pve and wouldnt pvp no matter how attractive it was you either need to leave missions alone or just phase them out trying to move them out of highsec will just make the pveers a target and most of them will refuse to be targets
not supportedsee my post in this thread for why
well local just works fine imo carebears can see if enemys enter systempeople that are looking for a fight can go looking for a fightyou can talk about nonsense and have fun in localyou can watch all the pointless smack in locallocal might not be realistic now  but so are internetspaceships in general dont try to make everything more realistic  the reason why we play games is because its not the same as real life 
i support my idea well its actually ccps ofc  gratz for that 
and chinese farmers can notice instantly if you enter the system so you cant hunt them local isnt perfect it gives too much information for everybody
chinese farmers enter lowsec or 00 
delaying local by 15 seconds is the ulitmate compromise for both sides
yes they do
the topic is pretty selfexplanatory things that occured to me as being of benefit1 currently caldari ships have to choose between shield tank and tackling gear which always puts them at a disadvantage in pvp moving the web scrams and warp scramsdisrupters to high slots would allow full tanking ability but at the cost of dps which kinda makes sense2 mission runners could fit one or two of these items and still be able to tank missions sure they lose a bit of dps but one slot is no big deal  this might help nudge them into lowsec mission areas knowing that they might stand more of a chance against mission bustersthe warp disruption field in focused mode on the heavy dictor inspired the idea seems to work well for it would this make ships too powerful tho discuss
no support  the current selection of high  medium and low slots is prety well balanced on most ships ugh ugh tempest ugh ugh  for instance most amarr frigates only have 2 medium slots  they dont even have a chance at getting a full tackleif you start moving tackeling gear to the highslots  youre going to get 6x web 2x disruptor destroyer fittings  or worse passive tanked drakes with 6x web and 2x disruptor it would need a whole new balancing of highslots and medium slots besides  the current system just works  frigates that a re tackeling arent ment to tank  most of the time amor tanking frigates have speed modules in their lowslots you can fit a merlin with 1x web  1x point  1x mwd  1x shield extender  2x od and have a more survivable tackler as most amor tanking frigs and mission runners are not going to use tackeling gear if they can place it in the highslots  they use that for damage for instance if you have a raven setted up for guiristas missions your just going to get d by a pvp fit armegeddon if you can webdisrupt or not
that might actually make destroyers moderately useful you are however forgetting that destroyers can be killed by sneezing on them also fun fact webifiers and disruptors use capacitor you cant passive tank a drake and still be a tackler in this fashion it might have 6 webs but without a mwd youre not going to be webbing much stick one of those on and see how long it lasts again a bs even with just the warp disruptors its still not as effective as a heavy dictor so this is not a problemtheres a speed nerf on the way they might be a little more vulnerable than you think afterwards think how much more survivable youd be with all 4 midslots dedicated to shield tanking you mentioned a raven as an example little is lost by using one of the nonmissile slots for a warp disruptor also if said armageddon was mission busting solo it would need a web and warp disrupt in its high slots to get you since were doing this in the hypthetical eve system were discussing so thats two less turrets for it and yes its still a lot of dps but its not quite as dangerous as it used to be
not receiving kill rights for pods in highsec is rather silly ill agreeim curious did you have a huge bounty or have a low sec status or somethingtbh i would file a bug report about it if the bug report says that its an intended feature then i would continue to ask for change from the csm if however the bug report states that its a new issue or god forbid a known issue that the gm didnt know about then i would state such in your petition and ask that the gm give you kill rights
should have used a shuttle autopiloting an implant pod is not smart i think this is a good mechanic
nobody is denying its stupidity theyre just asserting its criminality since the guy did get concorded afterwards i should imagine kill rights are also in order
this even stupid people are protected by the legal system i would have thought a pod kill would result in more than a kill right maybe lasts longer rather than no kill right at alli noticed before it got deleted that a ccp representative said this was an intended mechanic any explanation some rp reason from ccp would change my mind immediately but common logic points the other way
my sec rating is 161 and i have no bounties nor do i engage in criminal acts i have never been in touch or involved with the agressor nor were we wardeced etc this happened two jumps away from jita while autopiloting a pod back to a system after driving a ship over there there were no shuttles available in the system and it didnt fit in the hold so it is a bit rich to call me stupid because i flew in a podhowever this is neigher here nor there this issue relates to me not getting kill rights after after being killed in high secthe gm maintains that this is an intended feature though the logic of this entirely escapes me

second post in this thread
personally i feel that they would put an endall to the issue with whos wreck is whos i would sacrafice dps for salvage drones and those who dont use them should understand that their wrecks might be salvaged by someone else  sacrifice the ability to do one thing to do something else as well sounds like balance to me
not all ships have a drone bayalthough personally im against any form of wreck ownership
not all ships below cruiser but its not worth salvaging til you are at lev3 missions and most lev3 missions you are in at least a cruiser anyway unless you can fly t2 frigs  in that case why are you doing lev3s anyway
fair point although i dont think it changes the situation much people who salvage wrecks that they did not generate would just use the salvage drones as well the problem lies in the concept of wreck ownership and whether or not it should exist
for all sakes in fairnessbalance im not trying to tip the scales in how the game isanother round of quotation marks intended to be played just the fact that if one is willing to give up dpstime to use salvage drones to clear a room before they leave for the next while possibly being probed out by a scavenger makes sense to me i use dps or whatever drones to get the mission done as fast as possible if i have to sacrifice the quickness i finish a mission by using salvaging drones so be itbtw the state of marauders supports this push 
i didnt come up with this but kinda like the ea trailer but not that strong others in ships and mods have brought this up too but i didnt see it here cliffs noteslogistics ship with activation module 4 bss have link modules log ship links with bss and creates big superlaserthingy said superlaser thingy can cause a lot of dmg maybe enough to make a titan say ow wtf mate dread pilots say that really hurt im out and carrier pilots say aw hellcatch is the module sucks all cap and takes maybe 30 seconds to activate this kinda encourgaes a bit of blobbing but counters capitals onlineedit ive been out of the loop for a bit but if anyone ever played freespace 2 bombers were a caps nightmare bombs hurt caps mucho just a thought
bombs suck in eve there is currently no reason to use them ever make them cheaper better or both
it would be cool for bombs to have a significant impact against capitals it would also make sbs somewhat more worthwhile
i really like all of xttzs ideas they make the titan an actual ship you can fly with the fleet right now all we see of a titan is them sitting at a pos or warping in seeing a bright light and then the titan is gone i would love to be on grid in a large fight with a titan in the middle of it wreaking havoc sounds amazing
100 support this why do others have more sp than me not fair i want fair
totally support this it would be worth losing my 75m main just to fly around and see all the crap floating in space that nobody has the skill to fly anymore

id like an update from ccp about the state of industry in everorqual  is it filling the niche ccp wants orca  status report mining  is mining in its current incarnation what ccp wants if not how are they going to change ita general a roadmap for where they see industry goingits a big part of eve and its getting neglectedquarterly economics blogs
jade please add
isnt the next expansion about industry
nah i see where you are going an attempt to preserve yourself from an assault but thankfully there are peeps like me who kill because its just funkinda like your alliance rookies offer nothing worth taking when they get killed for ignoring very clear warnings prior to stealing yet they claim to have not seen the warning and the shooter is just happy to get a kill regardless of profit it will continue to happen because its fun and the risk is within reason noobs often think they are the baddest mothers in the valley and they lose a cheap ship because of it these pilots are why charles darwin sleeps soundly in his grave
like i mentioned its only a by product and after thought yeah it makes sense that cans still have ownership and flagging you did jettison it yourself so it is your canbut wrecks shouldnt have ownership at all no matter whose ship it used to be or who killed it in the end i really think that once a ship gets blown up the first scavenger who gets there is the rightful owner of whatever his module picks upif you dont want people taking from the wrecks that you generated shoot the wrecks and waste their time or move to 4 or below so you can shoot them otherwise scavengers ought to be protected by concord
ive supported this for those two above guns should remain on all structures and i think the modules that are outside of the shields are the right onesthis is the inherent problem of removing the bubble shield from large structures and why they should stayi think they should be normal pos guns no need to nerf defensive firepower keep cyno jammers at a pos they exist there now and theres no reason why they shouldnt be able to be defended with a pos simply restrict jump bridges to supcapital ships and freighters keeping defensive capital ships outside of jammed systems
well however you want to do it the point is to make moon pos a target for raiding forces so shields and guns should just be balanced to that end thats all if its better to simply state it that way and leave the details up to ccp fine with mebasically planets are for capship sovereignty sieges and moons are for subcap raidingthe cynojammer move may or may not be necessary if you reduce the firepower on pos but its been a very highly supported idea to place it away from pos the capship restriction on jump bridges in cynojammed systems also works the point simply being that a cynojammer should block all caps not just enemy onesan additional idea to make the sieges of planetary structures more interesting would be to place modules at each moon around the planet that must be attacked as part of the siege a rough idea might look like thisat the reinforcement battle the defender and attacker show up at the planet there are several modules located at moons around the planet that are supporting the planetary structure and in order to finally crack the planetary structure some portion of those modules must be disabled  but when disabled they only drop offline for 510 minutes so theres a large battle around the planet with additional battles taking place simultaneously to continuously keep enough of the moon modules disabled to allow the planet fleet to damage the planetary structure
lol why cant you guys see any kind of compromise on this stuffkelsin always talk about wanting small ship disruption objective giving them something to dogoons want 00 to be more valuable and less boring stuff like pos set upjade wants to shake up existing 00 powerblocks by making random which space is the best over time to keep the best alliance from sitting in the best spots foreverdarus doesnt want all he and goons worked to build to fade bc of some csm proposal wants to keep most big traditional elements of sov and 00so instead always try to rewrite what is already there why dont you add something totaly new why dont you do something like this  add new resource x x needs to be valuable and unlike what is now in the game it worth a lot of money and you always need to gather more and more of it kindof like moon minerals now but this is a new resource used for some new purpose but x only can be got in 00 x cannot be gathered by traditional mining or pos gathering or any other way that is in the game you have to set up some new structure that is like what kelsin want you put it up away from pos and small gangs can attack it and make it stop working for awhile x spawns randomly all through space on like 23 month period so maybe for 23 month bob has much x but then a lot of it goes to the north and if bob wants to keep getting it they have to go max damage and fight for it x has no effect on sov warfare or moon mining none of that gets nerfed or made less valuable or any different x is a new resource and adding it to the game makes 00 worth moreso what can you think off to be x
hey not bad that requires some coordination of forces to pull off i like ideas that require a fleet to break out into subunits that all work together at the same time to do a job ya the only thing i dont like is the inability to set up a shielded staging pos anywheremaybe say one of the moon pos configurations can be basically what a pos is now but it still doesnt contribute to sov so if you set up that kind of deathstar pos its not a small gang objective because theres nothing there to disrupt and you wouldnt normally set one up in your own space  it would really just be used as a staging point in an invasioni would try to come up with a role for titans that could do the same thing but you want the staging pos before the cynojammer goes down if you can get it
hmm staging pointsthere had been a brief discussion of mobile infrastructure at one point  thatd be a very interesting idea  basically a mobile shield generator that could be cynod into a deadspace for an invading force to stage from just prevent it from being brought into anywhere but empty space no moons asteroid belts etc thatd be a pretty cool thing to have at your disposal
sweet sweet progress nice it separates pos logistics and planet sov it creates a clear way for logistics to be subject to raiding moon arrays that power a planetary shield sounds awesome and makes sense and now removing the bubble shield from some moons seems viable as changing the role of titans removing ddd prevents a titan from coming in a blowing up a whole pos
doomsday could be turned into a focused singletarget attack to make it a very powerful anticapship weapon and titans could get this staging shield thatd address a couple issues at once
i do like the focused fire ability make it too expensive to justify oneswatting a battleship but make it powerful enough to justify using against a capital putting the titan into siege mode activates the bubble and deactivates the focused dddit would by funny if somewhere on the titan there was a giant cartoon offensedefense toggle
so it looks like were heading towards a proposal that covers these1improvements to sov warfare  planet sov structures supported by moon modules2moon pos turning to industrialonly raidable by subcap gangs somehow protected from ddd either by getting rid of it or building in some invulnerabilty etc3staging area shield  either mobiledeployable or new feature of revised titananything else that would need to be addressed im sure theres plenty of hashing out to be done regarding raiding of industrial infrastructure but as a broad topic it seems people can agree it would be good to have
can we put some additionally bribery into it somehow to help people get over the hump of the fact that it is new and change is scary no one is objective about this also it would be useful to go ahead and write a faq that answers all the easy objections to it that people will throw out without bothering to comprehend the proposal write why this isnt capturetheflag explicitly justify why blobbing the individual objectives wont be effective explicitly justify why people wont want to use caps for every part of this why caps will focus on the planetary objective and subcaps on the moon objectives add a stepbystep comparison of the new sov assault process with the old process to show that it doesnt make it take any longer or make it more tediousboring explain why this wont alter the balance between the defender role and the attacker role explain why this wont make it less profitable to live in 00 bonus if it makes it more profitable see request for additional bribery aboveyou get the idea it would help make the ensuing discussion be more than a bunch of partisan strawman bull maybeedit and let fahtim post the op whenever it goes up so half the thread isnt hurr you dont even live in 00 wtf just trying to be pragmatic
wording  2 moon pos turning to logisticssupportonly raidable by subcap gangs take away sovereignty claiming and move more modules outside the control tower shield possible moon roles miningindustry jump bridge cyno jammer planetary defensemention outright that the redesign of sovereignty and the redesign of titans must go hand in hand
sounds good to me i can whip up a draft we can start working on  something straightforward and not too heavy on details to start and go from there to get something ready for the assembly hall
first draftrecommended changes to 00this issue focuses on three areas of changes to improve gameplay in 00 sovereignty warfare1 improvements to sovereignty warfarechanging the sovclaiming structure from moonanchored pos to planetanchored bases2 raidable logisticssupport infrastructureremove sovereigntyclaiming from moonanchored pos reduce automated defenses and move most modules outside control tower shield to open them up to attacks by raiding subcap gangs pos would then be focused on specific nonsov claiming roles such as miningindustry jump bridge cyno jammer planetary defense3 invader toolstitan rebalancingto account for the above changes removal of aoe effect from doomsday device to be replaced with singletarget anticapship weapon and staging area shield abilitythese three areas of change combined are intended to make sovereignty warfare more fun and multifaceted and provide for better gameplay at the siege level as well as offer tangible raiding objectives for small subcapital gangsimprovements to sovereignty warfarethis change primarily hinges on moving the basis of sovereignty from moonanchored pos to planetanchored bases supported by planetary defense modules anchored at orbiting moons a new siege mechanic is introduced to make epic battles over these planetary bases more interestingthe planetary basethe planetary bases primary purpose is to establish sovereignty over a solar system secondary roles could include acting as a fuel depot for pos at moons in orbit around the planet to ease fueling logistics additional functions could also be addedwhen attacked the planetary base follows much the same path as current pos siege mechanics with one new additionupon the expiration of the reinforcement timer five planetary defense modules anchored at orbiting moons come online in order for the main fleet to inflict damage on the planetary base 3 of the 5 pdms must be disabled when disabled via damage a pdm will go into a short 510 minute downtime to repair itself once repaired it will come back online and resume supporting the planetary base thus attacking forces must continuously suppress the pdms around the base while the main siege force attacks the base itselfthe defending force must anchor the pdms but they are dormant and cannot be targeted until the planetary base exits a reinforcement timeroptions for making the pdm mechanic even more interesting include having them govern the heavy guns that defend the planetary base so that suppressing them deactivates the guns to aid the main siege forcenew roles of moonanchored player owned stations  raidingwith the movement of sovereignty mechanics to planetary bases moonanchored pos are free to be refocused as logisticssupport facilities and can be rebalanced to be targets for smaller raiding forces to inflict financial and logistical damageautomated defenses can be downgraded to be on a level consistent with attacks by small to medium size subcapital gangs facilities at the pos are made vulnerable to attack in a fashion similar to station services so that raiding forces that can infiltrate enemy territory can inflict financial damage by halting production research moonmining etc actual destruction of modules requires the destruction of the control tower itselfinvader toolstitan rebalancingto accompany the above changes a new tool must be added to the arsenal of invading forces and the aoe damage element of the doomsday device must be changed these two changes can be taken together to give a new tool to the titan in exchange for reducing the power of its signature weaponin place of the aoe damage element of the doomsday device it is recommended that the device be changed to a powerful singletarget blast designed to be attack enemy capitals and supercaps
didnt quite all fitin addition to provide for increased ability to stage forces in enemy systems prior to sieges a poscaliber shield is recommended as a new module for the titan allowing it to temporarily create a safe zone in empty space to act as a staging ground with this addition the titan will truly be a mobile battlestationconclusiontaken together these changes will improve the fun and variety of warfare in 00 space for all levels of force deployment  from the raiding small gang all the way up to the epic siege battle
objection this does nothing about the capitals online problem people will just use capitals for taking down the moonbased planetary defense modules in addition to using them to take down the planetary basethe pdms only stay down 510 minutes think about how long it takes you to warp slowaligning caps around in a laggy fleet fight you will never get your caps back into position at the planetary base to do damage to it during its window of vulnerability after taking down the pdms your dreads need to be sitting there ready to go into siege when they get their window of opportunityalso if you choose to attack the pdms with caps you risk several negative consequencesif you blob your caps around then your caps might be bubbled or trapped in siege mode at the pdm during the brief window during which the planetary base is vulnerableif you foolishly split your caps up among the pdms your several small groups of caps might get individually blobbed and destroyed by the defender
objection people are just going to blob all the planetary defense modules noone will spread outif you take that approach youre going to waste a lot of your dreadss siege cycles and make the process take longer overallsuppose that you need to knock out 3 out of 5 pdms to make the planetary base vulnerable when incapacitated the pdm stays down for 10 minutes  one siege cycle if you split your forces and coordinate so that they all go down at about the same time you can get about one full siege cycle of damage in if your blob takes them down one at a time and it takes 4 minutes for each one then by the time youve taken down 3 1 is going to come online in two minutes or so enjoy your two minutes of siege damage before the base goes invulnerable again
thats a great point about the siege cycles
objection well the defender will just blob up and kill the smaller gangs that are attacking the planetary defense modulesso what bubble them when they warp in blob up yourself and enjoy your huge badass fleet fight at least if they choose to blob your pdmkillers youll be fighting them at a pdm instead of a deathstar or lagstar pos the point of the idea isnt to completely eliminate blob warfare it wouldnt really help with lag much anyway because as soon as you get 400 guys in a single system it goes to  regardless of what grid youre onalternatively you can keep dodging their blob and hitting the pdms where there blob isnt in high lag it will take them quite a while to warp their blob from pdm to pdm load grid and start killing your pdmkillers who are already on grid and killing a pdm meanwhile all your other subcap groups are at other pdms bringing them downif youre talking about a fleet blob situation dont pretend that a blob of ships can flit all around the system on a whim smashing groups of subcaps maybe one group every 20 minutes if the node doesnt crash meanwhile the planetary base is vulnerable to sieged dreads and is getting its ass kickedobjection they wont need a blob theyll just warp a titan to the pdms and dd all the subcaps thereya the proposal includes a part about geting rid of the oldstyle subcapmurdering dd and replacing it with an anticap weapon so youre wrong
i think what a defender will actually want to do if they have a strong cap fleet is to blob the main attacking fleet at the planetary base the main attacking fleet will need to kill the defense fleet rather than firing on the planetary base so the pdmkiller subcap gangs wont be any use at the pdms they may as well all join the main battle at the planetary baseif the defender has a smaller fleet or a large fleet of mostly subcaps then theyd be best off trying to split up and kill all the enemy subcaps attacking their pdms if those pdms dont go down then the planetary base is safe and we already established that is sucks to use caps to take them downso the defender can manage an effective defense using either a gang of subcaps or a large cap fleet and regardless of either sides fleet composition both subcaps and caps are really usefuland the idea still leaves plenty of opportunities for the huge battles with big expensive ships that can only happen in 00
ccp should have been clearer on the voting system yesnoabstain personally i thought abstaining was in most but not all cases either irresponsible or lazy on the part of the delegate and if it were up to me abstention should not be an optionmaking abstention an automatic no would be the best solution imo if a delegate does not care enough to escalate the issue it should be a vote against the issue if a vote is 4 aye 4 nay 1 abstain it should not pass
i agree on thisxhagen sent us a note about the abstention option the original csm document didnt actually describe anything other than yes and no as options so i think you are right if abstain should be available it must count as a no
in a way i agree it should beaye motion passesnay motion fails cant be returned to the table during the current csm sessionabstain motion fails can be reproposed for consideration not by the same csm member this is the option to pick if youre not sure the idea is strong enough at the moment to present to ccp at the time of voting this allows people a chance to strengthen the case for a given issue and gather the support of wavering csm membersnay votes in this case should be rare given that the idea placed on the table should be reasonably strong enough to have attracted the csms attention however this can be used to deal with parody threads by bringing them to the table and firmly nailing the lid down on the issue for the remainder of the csm term
why are people so irrational about abstention its a vote just like any other abstain  afk with 9 in channel 8 abstains and a yes is approval its really not difficult now i dont think reps should abstain very often but when they do theres a very simple standard way of counting it
can you link the campaign threads please i want to see if the csms are activly working on the campaign promises i got a feeling one has done the complete opposite and needs to be shown the door of dishoner
sounds like an interesting idea to me supported
you know i actually quite like this suggestion it kinda makes sense it would probably help lag in huge fleet battles where it would say that a certain amount of an alliance is in system rather than each individual pilot in systemsigned
i can see that big alliances and corps would make a good use out of this suggestion controlling all or parts of local intel and comms but small player groups newbies and the average occasional miners would be completely fdno support
brutuusyour opinion is one sided a bit i think you missed some pointslets see a situation where a small corporation attacks a borderzone of a big alliance where the allaince has sov level2 so the continous intel level is on the second level the small corporations recon ship enters the system launches the best probe she has and receives intel on level3 for the pilots whole network until probe is alive i dont see a disatvantage here it could be easier to surprise those who think are safenewbies and average occasional miners would be forced to work in teams and learnadapt i dont see a problem here either this is not wow noobs die in masses anyways no matter whatin 00 the groups you mentioned cant expect a glorious future anyways like 90 of them not even with the current local mechanics if your concern is about low sec with this system players could settle down more easily by hard work or good connections  high standings they could have a nice intel resource there so they could organize their self defense enjoy better security than ever just think about distress signalsif you say the main problem is that all this isnt free then id like to see what do you do if all you have is a constellation channel 
small gang and solo players do not necessarily get into disadvantage with the proposed local change if they go to big alliance territory to do their stuff they will be in disadvantage of course in neutral areas tho like no mans land where noone has intel or in faction sov areas they will have the same chance as anyone else with the difference that intel is delayed for both parties if one has good faction standings he may even have advantage over the newcomers example serpentis agent runners have higher serpentis standings so they get better intel about local in serpentis controlled systems than the random ganker
hmmmcould make the whole ecmeccm thing more exciting too having shipsskills that allow folks to hack networks for infodisruptionill give it a thumbs up
i really like this ideasigned
the whole point of a local nerf isnt a massive boost for 00 alliance but rather as a nerf for 00 alliancesnot supported
actually i want local removed for rp reasons you think a local nerf would hurt large alliancethis is the strongest alternative ive seen so far everyone in highsec gets access to concord intel everyone with faction standings gets access to lowsec and npc 00 intel sovereignty holding alliance gets intel and can give it to those who have good standings with them allies just like setting up who gets shot by pos gunsmaybe not as complicated as you have presented but something along these lines that separates chat and inteledited forgot support
i sense a slight contradiction here and since when is republic military school is a 00 alliancebtw supported
thx for the summary and support ofc the only aspect i missed from it the small corporations and nonterritorial entities also have their chance to get an own source with some recon ships they can have an own mobile intelnetwork quickly easily and cheap
very interesting even if this is just a beta version of what local could be i still support this alternative or something like it being pushed forward
i like the idea would like to see ccps opinion of this and other local nerfs
great idea might help to get everyone in on the testing instead of just those that already have the sp
supporting to increase usefulness of test server a better tool for players and through emergence a better tool for ccp
yes do it pls
signed this is absolutely needed
we really need this to be changed 
this is a totally awesome idea please make it happen
better late than never i guess
ya

nano gangs will die soon tough read the dev blogs 
the one where they nerfed speed or the one where they moved all changes to multiplicity for reworking
the nerf as stated in the blog is udderly unfair and unbalanced while i agree ships need to have a cap put on speed for its ship class i do not agree that the nerf as it is proposed right now problems i seeinterceptors will no longer be capable of doing their designed roleswarp disruptors will be over powered and cause unstable game play options for smaller ships and gangs designed to move fast as a counter to larger fleets or for the intentions of tackle and actual interception youre making ships far slower and nerfing all forms of speed moduals and then making some of this completely redundant by suggesting that webs need to be nerfed all in all wether you like nanoed ships  wich by the way are no longer actually nano ships already due to nano nerfs prior  or you dont like them speedy guys the real point is speed is suppose to be a legit part to this game as designed by ccp in the form of ships with bonuses to go fast and have mwd duration bonuses on a scale of 110this nerf gets a 10 on the  not thought out prior to publication  systemi highly suggest people look into this fully and without emotion or favortisim and come to a feasable and proper means of reducing over speed ships that should not go as fast as they can right now ie battle ships bcs and yes even hacs can go at speeds they should not be capable ofi did come up with a thought wich is sure to have some if not full out rejection but i was thinking a possible dammage drawback to making ships too fast for its ship typeie a battleship given a max safe speed of 12 kms would take dammage to the hull wich will eventually end in destruction of the ship for going over its intended speed for the ship classthis in fact would be closer to a real life situation where as the structure is only made to take so much thrust and speed on certian moving objects before the structure becomes dammaged and unstablejust a thought  smack away 
supportskill queue for how long players wants what does it matter ok maybe a limit of 5 skillsnow people will tell me that we will have people farm characters on inactive accounts then the fix is easy1 account becomes inactive2 skill queue is disabled3 your current skill is finished subscriber needs to pay for the account and login to start skill training againi see no problem whatsoever with this and i can say i really hate skills that take less then 2 days why i dont want to have to plan my real life because of a game i love eve its the best game ever but i do have a life outside of it and i want to be able to take a day off without having to actually plan something in a game
i have to agree mostly with this a que will not effect wether someone plays or dont play it only makes them log in to change the skill so they can log out agianwith that said in reality it would not hurt to have a decent skill que system set up in fact i think many of the people who would not play but once or twice a week would benifit from this as would ccp wich currently looses out on some membeships due to the fact that this is a high matinance game requireing a large ammount of attention that many people do not have and therefore thoes types of people sometimes will not choose to play this game at all i am all for a skill que espcially considering ive lost a few people myself due to the high level of complexity involved in keeping an account training and such
a very simple design to skill queue that prevent people from abusing it is that you can only que the skill up to your activation time and problem solved
just do it fast
heres my thoughtsif i were playing wow then i could grind my points if i choose to here in eve i dont get that choice i have to login to change my skill so effectively any i pay for my training time and i lose when i am unable to login business work home projects solution let me que my training i pay for the time want to discourage acct farming if an acct is unpaid it can not train simple no training with a disabled acct dont want to let me que my training then credit me with time points that i can apply to any skill i wish these will take effect at the sphr i have for the skillbottom line in every mmo out there one has the ability to govern how fast or slow they gain experience by how much they play here in eve we do not it is one of the best things about eve except for the current defect of management of my skillsi play eve when i play eve i dont play eve when i log in to skill checkstupidest thing ever is to see someone log on and say skill check and log off the current thinking by ccp that skill checking makes people play is a fallacy the onloy thing skill checking does based on 2 years of playing eve is anger or annoy peopleplease fix this idea supported
here are my thoughts on the matter 1 character farming is going to happen no matter what all a smart programmer needs to do is write a macro enter the user names and passwords and with the miracle of onscreen character recognition the macro finds and sets the skill2 short skills are a pain yes we experienced players have 24 week long skills we can chip away at while we sleep younger players dont have that luxury yet unless its a useless skill they dont neednow for the meaningful part3 the queue should be a combination of the time length  max number system you can either set 2 long skills or set 48 hrs worth of short ones this will balance between beginners and experts these skills could also be modified by 2 more learning skills queue depth and queue length4 the queue should check subscription status at the end of each skill and if the account is inactive then the queue is lost this takes care of the farmers setting 2 intermediate length skills and stop paying5 military personnel should not be penalized for their deployments we work a lot harder than most of you civilians do our play time is limited and there is nothing we can do about it summeryfarming will happen no matter whatbeginners need thiscombine the time and number theoriescheck subscription status
i have mixed feelings on this its an interesting idea but it also seems geared toward giving a sizable advantage to the defenders and their friends
its actually not that bad of an idea
it makes sense that people who own the space and who have installed the proper intelligence infrastructure to have an intelligence advantage
i agree completely in fact it would we strange not toi like this idea but im interested in how recon ships would affect this network idea would system survey be some innate ability would it be improved by some skill andor do you need to install a module on your recon ship
very interesting idea 22 questions1 how do you see this impacting the mobility of players within the eve universeeg will players and corporations will tend to stick in one location because of the barrier to establishing such intelligence2 if players tend to stay in one systemconstellationregion what would be the impact of that on21 trade eg more differentiation in markets22 player experience eg i played eve for 2 years and never left my systemconstellationregion
interesting idea  obviously needs some working on but bookmarked to check out at a later date
amazing few players are able to give this detailed of an example i think the csm should pick this up simply because it is very well thought out obviously needs a little bit of tweeking to work effectivlyone recomendation from me have a level 0 base network in each system regardless of sec status that shows number of ships only not friendly or hostile status just the number of ships and how many are entering  leaving
i dont think it will have this kind of negative effect it will just cause people to be smarter and more cautious as they move around if intelligence was gathered and distributed depending on standing towards the sovereignty holding npc faction or player alliance it would still act as an early warning sign to rightful minersratters and would give incentive to hold space and interact diplomatically
i wonder if they have done some work on this yet
i support this as i think war needs to be far more unpredictable not oh look here come the ishtars
eh changes made are changes which can be changed yet again and with the benefit of hindsight if it is felt to be necessary
nanos are nothing more than the new wcs they do the same damn thing namely let you engage without committing to the fight the only difference is that wcs were available to pretty much everyone and uber nanofits are only for the wealthythey should either nerf the nanos or reverse the wcs nerf the stated reason for the wcs nerf was to make people commit to fights i see the nano nerf doing the same
this is right on im sure to an empire player that doesnt participate in pvp at all this missionsagents in 00 stuff sounds like a great way to placate alliance players and add value to 00 but its going about it all the wrong way00 doesnt need uncontestable safe riskfree ways of making money it needs risky contestable but profitable ways of making money contestable meaning hostile forces can earn some profit by disrupting it risky obviously meaning that you or your source of income can be stolendestroyed and profitable is pretty relative but i think we can agree that both npc and conquerable 00 should be at least profitable if not more so than empire for the individual player no right now that only applies to npc 00 thats a problemfor those whove never left empire here are the three most common ways to make money in conquerable 00 and how they rate in the three aforementioned attributesbelt rattingrisky yes you can be killed quite easily while rattingcontestable no roaming gankers killing ratters cant make any money from the belts without spending hours ratting themselvesprofitable not very unless you have hours to set up chains and kill them quickly and find where they go when they hop belts ughratting needs to be changed or improved for profitability without compromising risk rat value being moved more toward loot value faction items or supercompressed minerals could result in increased contestability by allowing those who kill ratters to take home a bit more than 23m in crappy named loot rogue drones already do this which is kind of cool but not quite good enough ratting is also extremely extremely boring far more boring than missionsminingrisky same as belt rattingcontestable not in the slightest moving ore is difficult for miners impossible for roaming gangs or hostiles doing area denialprofitable yes but only highendscontestability could be improved by introducing something like playerbuilt asteroid seed beds that improve spawn rates and quantities but can be raided disabled destroyed looted etc profitability could be improved by introducing ways to harvest significant amounts of lowend minerals in 00 belts bringing their profitability nearly to highend levels and reducing the total reliance on highsec resources that exists in 00 currently mining is obviously very boring but can be done halfafk so this isnt a huge problemexplorationrisky not very as there are all sorts of barriers to being located probing down the complex and then further barriers to being actually tackled attackers arrive in the first room and cant use mwds same as with missions basicallycontestable barely hostiles can probe down and run the complex you found before you do but since complexes can spawn anywhere theres no reliable way to do thisprofitable usually very with exceptionsrecon probes need to be able to locate explorers in complexes of course at a reduced speed and reliability from probing someone in normal space profession sites have taken a dive and need to be looked at seriously escalation chances and factionoverseer spawn chances need to be improved for some sites other sites do far more dps than is reasonable andor dump you into the middle of situations that are nearly impossible to handle without timing your warps perfectly and getting reps on your tank immediately complexes need to spawn reliably in certain areas to increase contestability
youre kidding me right are you seriously trying to say that you dont know that people rent out lab slots in their empire poses or that people hire themselves out as mercenaries or that people have been able to create courier missions through the contract screen for over 4 years and yes all of these come with shiny isk attached to itbecause its a fraking mmo and you need to help the alliance to get helped by it most alliances provide free or discounted ammo mods and ships to their members you need to do a little work to get those benefits maybe if you actually joined a player corp youd understand this stuff its really rather basicomg please please please try to actually play this game that you are supposedly recommending changes for
i would first like to start my post by stating that there seems to be so much confusion and i cant get no reliefi see this whole issue as being about a number of tiered issues that have to be decided upon each in turn before discussing anything furtherfirst as the honorable cash warbash has explained above me private stock trading systems within a corpalliance structure can and do work efficiently they promote participation in the organization with stock rewards and the dividends that follow and allow for internal trading of those stocks for those in the organization the issue with a system as described by cash above is that it does not lend itself to a ccpauditedadministrated system without dramatic changesthe differences between a privately traded corporation such as cashs and publicly traded ones such as what many of you suggest could simply be distinguished by having a tagflag within a new ccp stock market abbrev ccpsmsystem those corporations that do not wish to be publicly traded should simply be privatebeyond that when dealing with the ccpsm there seem to be a number of important concernsaspects that previous posters to this topic have mentioned i will only quote the first to mention them here and not comment myself if their points are clearas ricdics hoe said then followed up by matalinoand as cailais saidand as joemina brought up which seems to augment cailaiss pointwith the above in mind it should be very simple for a ccpsm to be created that allows for stock in public corporations to be traded this stock should be valuable based upon the profits of the corporation selling the stock and dividends should be paid out each period based upon said profitany further specifics of such a system should only come about after a concept is accepted by the governing body csm anyone interested in such a system should also realize that any such implementation to eve would likely require many revisions before being complete and would not be complete if any obvious and nonobvious menthods of scamming and fraud can be seeni hope this post helps clarify and consolidate a number of the ideas floating about and i would welcome discussion with anyone on this subject please feel free to send me a message on the forums or in gamethank you for your time kubic harthaces
there is a catch you refuse to see there are already plenty of pvpers with tons of isk and stuffso if you nerf new players income it is not true that all ships get a purpose it means that you are sending new players in t1 fitted cruisers against old players in t2faction fitted bs with the old players capable of replacing his loss in minutes selling those cruisers to the new players mostly while the new player would spend days and weeks to replace the cruisera balancing making the players use lesser ships would require equalizing the playing field too removing the isk advantage of the older players if not you simply are saying i love the advantage my accumulated wealth give me beat the newcomer down so i keep the advantage your argument are simply about nerfing the income of people that dont play like you so you can get an advantage on them
yes you want them in low sec with a damned frigate you know what it mean 90 slash 2 million hour for level 4 missions 10k hour for level 1 mission
are you people really so far removed from reality to actually believe this stuffthe main playstyle for missionrunners possibly even the most common playstyle in the game is the mission runningship progression playstyle in which you run missions to earn iskies to improve your shipgear to run missions better to earn more iskies to improve your ship further and so onand even if you have a very hard time understanding this this kinda of playstyle is very rewarding for those who engage in it and it is only possible with highsec missions that earn you decent iskiesmove them to lowsec and you cant reasonably use a pimp ship anymore killing all the fun keep them in highsec but totally nerf their rewards in highsec pimping ship becomes pointless either of which makes the entire game pointless for this common type of player now i know you guys think that eve will be better off without them but really dont you see how silly that particular point of view would be for ccpthe more i read these threads the clearer it becomes that the real issue here is that some people actually enjoy the activities that earn you iskies while others hate them so those who enjoy them and thus are doubly rewarded must of course be nerfed to keep it fair compared to those who hate them who also pay for their earning with boredom
lets take at face value those that say that top rewards for level 4 missions are too high and they are thinking about game balance and no other things so let start with some assumptionfirst reward from missions if you arent a top missioner arent so high 20 millionshour less than what i can get in 00 ratting or in low sec using the level 20 agentssecond players need to be capable of recovering ship losses in reasonable timeso what is possible to do to reduce top rewards without nuking rewards for the players new to level 4 missions1 when you refuse a mission the agent will not have a second mission available for you for 4 hours 2 break the mission hub with several good quality agents in the same system edit with that i mean no more than 1 positive level 4 agent from the same faction in the same system if possible not less than 3 systems between positive level 4 agents of the same corporation effect players interested in farming the best missions will be forced to move around to get them a player that need a long time to complete a mission will notice it less a player very fast in completing missions will se a net decrease in his return less lag in the mission hubs more difficulties to low sec afk hauling missions farmers 3 change how mission respawn after dt instead of respawning the whole mission respawn only the group with the critical loot or the target group and the not destroyed spawns position should be no important so a tag near the spawn on the database destroyed yesno should be sufficient reducing database burdeneffect this will reduce the possibility to farm the missions for the high bounties after each dt i am not so convinced it is so common but i can be mistaken 4 if all the above is not sufficient move the level 4 agents with 11 quality and the level 3 with 16 quality to low sec or even the 6 and 11 respectively if you feel it is insufficient so 3 easy steps that will reduce top rewards with little impact on average rewards so still allowing a progression for the players interested in missions
just a fyi for everyonethis is who you are arguing withsave your breath
ahh so that is where that lingering feeling of deja vu in this thread came fromand those mild nerfs proposed by venkul do seem reasonable enough regrettably ccp has a track record of being incapable of mild nerfs its usually leave as is or nerf it to hell and as is is vastly perferable in this case
these four steps are actually pretty nice if you where to start a new thread with these i would support it
i agree with this post though what do you expect this is classic ccp rather than fixing actual issues theyre just going to reshuffle things so that they can call it an upgradeseriously quit playing around with things that are unimportantunbroken and actually fix the things that are broken firstshort listforums search thank god for third party search sitesfinding your own poststhreads it can be done but not as easy as it should beigb support seriously ingameboard is even in the url and it still failsbesides who complained about the current organization of the forums that ccp wants to shuffle them anyway theres no way it could have been more people than who complain about the forums being broken in this way or that
yeah the forums kinda lacking one aspect is the search function no matter what i do it seems to pull out 100 year old posts
this post i must give a 9 out of 10 good job well rounded thoughts and lots of info to think abouti certianly agree that rigs need both a little balancing and prolly a few more new rigs as well though i am guilty of taking advantage of some of theese end all be all rigs in certian set ups i do agree that it is unbalanced and needs some careful attentionhowever i also think that salvage needs to be looked into as well to bring more salvage for people makign rigs i personally think we need a hike of 100 percent on salvage that comes out of things however after discussion with others 20 percent seems a lot more balanced the cost of some rigs especially t2 rigs can get insane and tbh most t2 rigs are not worth what people try to get out of them unless youre an isk farmer and can afford to throw away a month of isk on a single t2 rig all in all i support this thread
one more for the hell of it i have fond memories of reading the chronicles when i first played eve  they were part of the lure for me id even like to see some more information regarding the intaki too
signedme loves a good story
you have some valid points here couched in sarcasm however i must disagree that with your assertion that all these hisec crappymoons will be snatched up by the major alliances in all cases of the moons i have been looking at in hisec not a one of them makes enough isk to even pay for the fuel to keep a small pos running monthlythat said i will relook at my notes and run a few more scans to see if i have missed something that would better support your arguementthanks for the input 
agree with the premise of making moon minerals a finite comodity

before something like this is even considered the deployment and removal of towers needs a complete overhaul spending 56 hrs deploying and 45 hrs removing one tower every 3 months multiply that by however many towers is currently run just to keep the same production going simply should not be an option
sentury guns even at 200 percent more dammage will not at all stop a camp it will only stop some solo gankers from sitting on a gate flagedif you fear for your badger that much go to high sec cause low sec is suppose to be low sec not high sec
improve the guns arent necessary just dont go into lowsec whit badgers and etc if you are soo noob to let them to lock you its your problem cos some people too stupid for fit hisher ship for lowsec its their fault not the gunspirate camps will going on if you make the guns more stronger but enough stronger the guys cos they arent destructable
the reason that lowsec is dead right now is that its imbalanced toward the pirates try to do industry or npcing out there and youre just a victim try to antipirate and you just go broke because the pirates will just scatter when presented with anything close to an even fight and tend to drop crappy loot even when you do catch them outit collapsed for a reason and that reason is not because the game mechanics make it too hard to pirate anything that starts to shift the balance from the outlaws back toward the citizens will help bring people back there
you need to make up your mind on one thread this morning you say if you dont like it go to highsec on another you say we have to find a way to get you out of highsec
not signed for already stated reasons
i disagree with this low sec will be more useless and is there actually any pirates signing this or is it high sec livers wanting to pass through low sec with less gate campingand if you are signing this you should live in low sec to be able to signe it not jut random high sec00 s

this might be the holy grail  a lag whine thats not based in ignorance supported if only for the novelty of it all
ug nothis rates right up there with an idea i heard today wich went something like  just dont allow people to target other players in high sec  it is kinda lame to have yourself ganked in this way in high sec but there needs to be a proper way of getting all you high sec noobs out to low sec and 00 if yer too comfy in high sec then eve in general fails all in all we need more people comming out of high sec  not keeping you all basking in the glory of an idea that you are untocuhable while not in low sec or 00 aside from war decs wich npc corporation members already have
its proposed as an alternative to the suicide gank nerf that the devs have already outlined compared to that it would make pvp in empire more common not less and it might even revitalize lowsec to some degree
awwww he wants more noobs to killx o dthats exactly what keeps them in high securitysome people dont even last as long as a month to play this game and they wont stay there forever you cant make big bucks in high sec everyone knows that
never heard of l4 missions i see
pfft level 4 missions do get you some good cash yesbut the really good stuff is out in 00 space o 
great idea in principle however i think the right to be a licensed concord deputy or whatever needs to be earned so in caldari space a very high standing with at least 3 caldari corps and a very high sec status would make you an lcd in caldari hi sec space with the right to attack any negative sec status ship and any ship that has behaved in any way deemed criminal that way prats would have to be as careful in hisec space as the rest of us do in losecpersonally i would add the right to join the aggressed side in a wardec to provide some support for smaller industrial corps against griefers since the lazy goodfornothings who masquerade as gms in this game wontfor balance i would have very severe sec status and standing hits for lcds who hit the wrong ie innocent targetit would almost be like hisec prats would have to earn there livelihoods which at the moment they do not
id absolutely love a khanid abaddon or apoc id say 7 launchers 5 torp rof bonuses and a 5 resistance per level8 high 5 mid 6 low 75 mb drone bandwidth itd be a crazy good angel missioner
all for it there are many underused factions and i think some crossempire factions would be an excellent addition to eve in general no more caldariamarr and gallenteminmatar camps but more greyscale is goodresulting ships would be excellent for the roleplayers as well as the players that love exotic shipsand yes for intaki and soe ships
if we go there it is possible to boost a little the navy ships especially cruisers and frigates and some faction battlecruiser and destroyer would be awesome
as we have a new similar thread about this matter ill just paste my post from the other one here and add support too

im pretty sure this feature used to occur iirc as an evemail to the ceodirectors informating who accepted the application or in the members application screen which doesnt keep the history anymoreideally this would be implemented into the logging feature discussed for joins since there is already a kill log type feature ccp mentioned that they made the logging more generic to support eg pos mailingsthen you could audit it i would look for one more feature for this which is exposure of the information in the api so the people who develop websites tools for corporation management can include it in their interfaces
agreed it makes sense then the ceo can go well you employed him dammit at the director or personnel officer who employed whoever just robbed all your bposperhaps an ex corp member list might be nice too
signedthere used to be a way to tell who accepted the appthen around the time that revelations 2 came out it was changedi want it back
years ago ccp created the interbus here you have chronicles
would be interesting if this included convoys that were ganked midroute destroyed players transportations so there was a small percentage risk that some random pilot would gank the interbus transport
only if i could blow the ships up and get mad loot they sound like they would be about as strong as shuttles and that would be great
i totally disagree interbus is fine for the lore of eve and as a service for npcs only but it is not a smart idea to create a game element in eve that the players could do themselves if you want transport pay a player to do it if that isnt currently working too well then i would support the addition of game elements that would make a player run interstellar ups a more viable profession
if we are talking about the interbus as described in the chronicles we would have a transport service for people only and personally i dont see much merit in that if you want to be transported somewhere you can use a shuttle on autopilot or if you need a fast transport you could use jumpclonesan npctransport like interbus wouldnt be useful in my opinion exept when the following criteria are met1 it is faster than using a shuttle 2 it is safer than using a shuttleand those 2 criteria have in my opinion the potential to be quite gamechanging
i was thinking about something simmilar to contract systems but with few days off timer from creating contract to finishing it and no additional npcs in space more like teleporting items from station a to station b maybe with some rules like no minerals no courier mission items etc idea is to get back things like old assets leaved monthsyears ago in some distant empire systems not preventing people from buying freightersnobody from players will take a contract with 300 m3 and 40j half in low secs for around 1m isks and if cargo isnt worth much then its not worth to pay some ridicious amount of money for it thats why many players have assets in 100 different stations different regions and no idea what to do with it
i think this could work as something where you have to pay a fee to get transported nearinstantly and where you can only go to certain fixed stations which should get scarcer when you head into lowsec space of courseshipping should of course be left to players the interbus like any other company should employ pilots to freight things for them of course and only handle personal transports themselves
our alliance had our logo submitted well before the freezing of new logos for a new process it was never put in game ccp has been totally unresponsive in answering when this will be addressed cant we at least get an answer as to a best guess when new logos will be put in eveminor point for folks that already have one but a big deal for folks like us we put a lot of effort into getting one made and submittedissler dainzefounder of beep
i wonder if the cold dark harsh universe argument applies here
ive been skeptical of that system as well it would be cool to have our own corporate logos and alliances as welli think we should at least get some sort of idea as to howwhy the system is so restrictive and slow to respond other than the obviousness of keeping the uh well nasty trash out
taking a mission sensitive item is in no way a violation of any rule
killing them doesnt guarantee you get the mission item in fact the mission item can be destroyed when you kill them then youre screwedand if they ninja the mission item and dock up before you can kill them then youre still screwedlast time i checked all wrecks in a mission belong to character whom pulled the mission
as odd as it may be i do agree that it is far to easy for people to go in and ruin a mission on you wether high sec or low sec one main issue is how easy it is to scan a missioner outthough it was said to be made harder in fact ive found it is not i can scan a missioner out within 29 seconds in a covert frig with ease go in and kill them with my main or take their stuff and lolz in local it is an evil thing to do yet fun for the one doing iti do support making some way to stop people not in gang with the missioner from grabbing or destroying a mission sensitive object merely because in all honesty thoes who do that sort of thing  including me  only do it to  in peoples cornflakes and it really has no proper place in eve other than that
this is only true if they do not provide the mission runner with a way to get it back i always make sure to ransom it back for 550 mill depending on mission level also i do not believe this applies anymore anyway since stealing the objective now causes aggro
can any one think of other factions currently in game and the race combos they use
eom ships  yes amarrcaldari combos as minmatar already has multiple combos alreadyfor those who do not know eom ships are like shield tanked apocs that use rails etc
it should work like other channels if you talk you show up simple i dont think the channel was really there to be used as a tactical toolor just be able to shut the channel
if local is nerfed in any way there will be less people ratting or mining in 00less targets and all that
heatsink i feel sorry for them fish there going to boil 
from a purely outside perspective i would say  the runner put in the time they should reap the rewards from my own standpoint ive run missions and ive trained the skills for probing with great disatisfaction towards finding sites ive spent the isk to make a build a ship with uber fast scans i know both sides allthough youll never catch me looting someone elses kill and yeah no matter how you cut it it is what it is others ravageing the carcass of your kill theft whatever thats what it is dont deny it all that being said sure anyone with any pride is going to take a hit to their ego when some comes by and takes away part of their prize when im running mission i can sell the salvage 12 times a month for 150200 mil isk thats my isk my salvage my kill do i salvage every mission no maybe 85 do i have a major issue if i see 1 person salvaging my mission in 1 of the missions i do noi havnt run missions in 4 mths or so but at that time id occasionally see someone pop in my mission  and politely leave sometimes they ask if they can salvage sometimes i so sure and pass off the other bms from the 1st couple of stages sometimes im building rigs and want it myself or am low on isk and wanting to drain every isk out of every bleeding minutie i can get to play ive seen people ask in local does anyone mind if i salvage your wrecks ive seen plenty nice chats and have even given the ok to do it and on occasion asked if anyone wanted my bms as i dont have time for the salvage and even said feel free to take the looti think what this comes down to is there are a few that ruin it for all instead of the mojority getting in a big upheaval about it and lets face it the only ones that are going to win are the smacktards causeing the issues cause they want the aggro so they can loot your pve ship we should come to a common understanding i think the mojority would be able to handle it as far as being courtous i think the runners need to be more proactive in saying hey over here free salvage and it would go a long way to putting this fire out but both sides have to work towards it and its the mission runners that will benefit the most out of the cooperation that the salvagers want otherwise itll be mission running gank fest or itll stay the same as is and everyone will just be miserable
predationweve all seen it or at least heard of it at one point or another some have participated in it whilst others are hapless victims a predatory player is generally a highsp player who enjoys ambushing and harassing though racketeering protection money or outright shipequipment destruction lowersp players or simply players that are caught in an unarmed or lowertier ship gate camping is common as is simple banditry many players are each day attacked and have their ships and equipment destroyed for no more reason than being in the wrong place at the wrong timeand thats not very fun is it well for the victim i imagine its great sport for the player killersbut this frustrates and downright angers many players especially the ones who arent interested in eves brand of socalled pvp before certain people start clamoring about its called pvp and such let me point out just what pvp means player versus player the versus indicates that it is a match between two or more people a massacre is not a match its just being a jerk most eve players fail to understand this whether it is a lack of respect for their fellow players or just that they have no consideration for anyone but themselves i dont know and im not going to explore that herethe point is its not very nice and it makes a lot of peoples lives that much worse if youre going to play an mmo you need to be able to get along with people but since letting people do that on their own isnt working in a general sense id suggest regulating pvpi personally would suggest a toggle that lets players on an alliance corporation or personal level decide if they want to be open for playertoplayer aggressiondiscussion is encouraged
one of eves most attractive features is that it is a single server other games have regular servers possibly with pvp zones and pvp servers in which players can attack other players without prior consent or even warning eve has one server and the character of that server is one of nonconsentual pvp thats by game design and it is what had attracted a sizable portion of the game community in one way or another pvp fuels the market as well as the pvpers and the competition it generates both directly and indirectly is what keeps the game interesting5 and higher security has elements of safety to protect the unwary or the uniterested 4 and lower you actually need to pay attention to the game there are game mechanics which give you prior warning to potenital hostile player activity chiefly the map and local working with other players like the teamwork of which you spoke is another defense by scouting and sharing intelligence and when it absolutly cant be avoided there 2 player professions which an preyed upon player can seek for assistance the mercenaries and the antipiratesgrieferssome elements player combat mechanics do need to be tweaked but its not further regulating and restricting the occurence give antipirates some kind of reward system for their work fix the bounty system take insurence payouts away from those that break concord engagement laws 15 min prior to their ship destruction this increases the risk and loss for would be predators but at the same time fix local the map and mechanics that promote large blob combat so that the pvp that does occur willingly and unwillingly can be more rewarding for all
for every player in eve that is angered by the encounters you describe there is some other player in eve who loves the tears
eve is a mmo based around a fairly brutal system of pvp anyone undocked can be attacked at any time there may be consequences for this but theres no ban on it and thats quite intentional its a very different style that attracts a different player base scammers pirates griefers the works  all are welcome here when more traditional mmos try to throw them out on their ear im not normally the sort of person to reply to every whine with gb2wow but in this case it might well be justified the experience youre looking for is fundamentally different from the one eve seeks to provide if that is truly your opinion and youre not just trolling then perhaps an alternate mmo might actually be best for you
the tendencies of the newest dev blogs and features implemented  and to be implementedat eve does show that ccp is not turning eve into this brutal only game that you describe eve to be this is simply untrue because eve is still a business and as any business it will go with the market tendency which is not what you are saying that eve seeks to provide also no there is no need to seek alternate mmo actually this isnt a healthy way to conduct a debate simply asking people to quit the game insie eve forums
who are you and wtf are you talking about
what a horrible game braking idea to allow a pvp toggle not breaking in the sense that it wouldnt work but in the sense that it would kill the whole game as it is today the nice thing about eve is that it offers a single gameworld with some framework but basicly tries to impose as little artificial limits as possible those limits that are imposed like the recent suicide gank nerf usually make sense in the gameworld and only provide consequences nothing prevents you from actually suiciding your ships even with the new rulesthe uneven pvp situations that the op talks about are just consequences of this given freedom realistic and to be expected in this game we have safetynets so we are always able to get back up after falling and try again we can also fail miserably since we have to compete with other players in the things that matter because you can actually lose things here you wont pull any punches when competing with other players its you and your allies versus potentially everyone else this is pvp when you remove all the artificial constraints that usually limit people in games and its how things work in eve and in irlyes this is only a game but it tries to create a deep varied living world the safety the op is asking can be achieved with experience skill and common sense even in this game but the method she is proposing doesnt belong in eve and isnt even needed keep in mind that all the options that are available to them are available to you too here you just have to actually put some effort yourself and work with others to level that playing field the immortality highsec and easy isk should be all the entitlement that a player ever needs in eve

redefining the chair we have seen quite a bit of drama revolving around the chairman position latelyok since forever really its pretty obvious whyno offense to jade but i frankly also think that a lot of the buzz was not called for one of the main points being made in the arguments is that jade is the chairman of the csm thus represents the council or at least so people seem to perceive it i think this is a bad position to put the whole council in thus i personally think that the chairman position should be reworked in order to avoid such situation as well as giving it a more fitting titlehere is how i could see it working out betterexecutorthe job of the executor consists of several things1 acting as a mediator to solve any issues2 plan meetings3 supervise the meetings as a fallback moderatormoderation is meant as leading the discussion just like we have a moving chairman right now the owner of any certain issue will direct the discussion from start to finish this concept should be brought onto the next csm if not as a guidelinethis accomplishes that we now take the chairman can not put the council in a bad light due to the fact all council members are equal the position should be voted on unlike the current chair positionwhat do you guys think its basically a way for streamlining the council and lessen the increasing apathy from players
the fact that there seems to be a ranking system inside the csm dependant on how many people voted for a given delegate seems to prove the fact that members of the csm arent treat as equalsim not going to get into a slagging match im tired of it and ive made my point in the past perfectly clearly and with a lot of supportif i can say anything constructive id say that there needs to be a lot more ccp interaction with the csm not just these meetings in iceland every so oftenid like to see a member of ccp permanantly devoted to chairing the csm with the delegates selected by the community to meet with him and speak to him on a regular basis in these meetingswhat this would do is make sure that all the delegates are treat equally and that no one has or is seen to have the power of veto sorry for the pun not intended although ill happily use the free plugthe csm delegates need to be equal in stature and need to report back to ccp in a manner that gets all their voices heard at present look any any of the meeting agendas and you can see whos issues are being pushed forward the mostid like to see a ccp chairman who organises and moderates all the meetings with the csm there to meet with him and speak to him with all delegates on equal footing
i dont see the bias in the selection and raising of issues everyone is free to raise issues the fact that the chairman coincidentally happens to be the person who raised the most issues is irrelevant as its not reducing the ability or acceptance of anyone elses issuesiirc and would be good to have factsstats on this issues that are raised and not well thought out dont get voted through as a result the chairman has more than his fair share of rejects
id agree with this especially now with ccp taera being brought onto the ccp team i believe that her job description involves community liasion duties at the very least a member of ccp needs to be present at each csm meeting in order to be able to reply to queries that can be answered with a simple yesnoexample with the recent dev blog on forum changes there is a lot of speculation that ccp doesnt intend to run the alliance tournament in future can you clarify whether this is truequeries that need a slightly longer answer can be researched and the answer given at the next csm meeting ideally for ongoing issues that ccp have said that theyre working on they should be providing progress reports to that the playerbase can beconfident that it truely is being worked on and not being fobbed off with its coming soonexample with regards to the earlier meeting regarding skill queue ideas the playerbase have requested that an update be provided as to which ideas have been considered which ideas have been totally ruled out and how far along any acceptable ideas have gotten in the implementation phasemeanwhile the really big issues can be collated and hammered out in the face to face meetings thus satisfying ccps vision of their iceland meetings with the csm being used for dealing with big picture issues  long term vision ideasexample all the various ideas for changes to 00
regarding the proposition by lvvim appreciative of the csm but to be blunt from day one ive found various organizational aspects detracting from what could genuinely be an asset to both new eden and the subscriber base this isnt satisfactory therefore im generally in favor of what youve written and would like to see it move forwardthough i cant say for sure what immediate impact it would have regarding the apathy if not outright hostility that has been expressed recently perhaps in the long term there will be improvements in perception realized
i should say that i consider my role as chair to include supporting a share of good issues that dont ordinarily fall into the interest categories of other csm delegates when we get to the end of the term ill post a retrospective account of the session listing the various issues i advocated alongside my reasons for supporting  people are free to read and assess the decisions ill also post a personal voting record so my actions in office are clear as can be this general charge that im supporting nothing but a personal agenda is a common accusation  but its often the case that people look at the early items on agenda tagged with jade and jump to the conclusion that these things all come from sf people or my mates but a little examination of the issues involved will quickly disprove this misapprehension of the facts just take a look at this weeks agenda thread for an example of jumping to conclusions  the agenda wasnt even complete before people started jumping up and down and yelling bias bias bias  some people are never happy if they dont have something to moan aboutprotip i dont do the final ordering of the agenda until past the submission deadline where i arrange the order to give delegates issues a fair priority in the order delayed issues from previous meeting are first  then each delegate gets alternate issues 1 each till we get to the surplus at the end in this weeks mix im presenting issues from players associated with razor iron pandemic legion electus matari the red skull goonswarm and 13th udorian rangers  id say that was a pretty diverse mix of interest groups to be quite honestanyway i think were doing the best we can in the circumstances and those csms that choose to run again for election will be accountable for their actions in office during this term and all is good those people who decided not to run in this inaugural council might well throw their hats into the ring in the autumn and perhaps next time round well get a council of people who can make us look like amateurs
i frankly think this is an excellent idea
id fairly strongly disagree with this the csm is a creature invented by ccp but not of ccp i dont feel that the practical working relationships which have grown within the csm would exist with an external chair and as such we wouldnt get so much done the csm needs a bit of toandfro during discussions and to make that way more formal  as would happen with a ccp chair  would quell thatiz
toman your analysis is precisely why ive been pushing for offgrid objectives for the sov tools suddenly sov warfare becomes a whole hell of a lot more interestingcan we get a full proposal draft working on the speakers corner before going to csm kelsin fahtim and i already have dead proposals there are many many more id like to clean one up to a great extent and make sure it builds momentum fast as if starting off with multiple architects from different sides of the galaxy isnt a good sign
what we need is a delegate to read this thread or at least pages 4 and 5 and have them start the thread and sponsor it onto the meeting
just after reading this i was using a lighter to light some coals the top popped off randomly and i thought nothing of it only to discover that the lighter itself had completely caught on fire while i was holding itwtf its on fire in my hand im going to sue bic and donate the funds to ccp to build a much faster server so we can fix lag and drop this whole proposal down the toilet i should probably go check that my living room hasnt also started spontaneously combustingwe should write up a proposal draft for said csms and get them to support it otherwise it looks like csm 1 is supporting csm 2s proposal and ill be amazed if that isnt used later as defacto ego spam
this trivializes sov warfare and lets any small gang chip away the sov of a thousandsstrong empireno it doesnt this new sov warfare system is more immune to small gang harassment than the current system isunder the current system if you find a small pos with no guns you could park a capstable geddon there all night and fire at with t1 ammo and blow it up if no one came to stop you under this new system you must have a fleet to take down the sovholding structures the planetary bases which are the sovholding structures are invulnerable to attack unless the majority of their satellite defensive modules have been incapacitated those satellite modules are selfrepairing on a pretty short timer any small gang that tries to take down a planetary base is going to be stuck playing whackamole with the defensive modules and never be able to hurt the planetary basewhat the new system allows is a role for small gangs of subcapitals to split off from the main fleet and pursue subcapital sov objectives in support of the activity of the main fleet without the rest of the fleet there the small gang is useless without the small gangs the main fleet the cap fleet is useless everyone is working together in the same system at the same time
the proposal supplies a means for gangs of raiders to temporary disabled alliance moonmining unless something is added to balance that out it will hurt the overall profitability of living in 00 and increase the pain of it so theres another angle to work into the proposal because in fact the profitability of living in 00 needs to improve somehow not get worsemaybe instead of improving the profitability which is difficult because of market dynamics we can decrease the cost were already changing some things about pos while were at it lets decrease the upfront costs and overall upkeep costs of posthese are not complicated changes decrease the cost of pos and pos modules this can be done by decreasing base costs and by increasing the drop rate of faction pos bpcs decrease the rate of pos fuel and trade goods consumption increase silo capacities so that pos require less tedious maintenanceall of this needs to be in the same proposal the problems in 00 cannot be addressed piecemeal because they are all interconnected you cannot design a sov warfare proposal that does not affect 00 profitability so both have to be addressed at once
second draft adding some language about profitability in the face of potential raiding keeping it in broader terms is probably smart since ccp will be handling the exact nature of that sort of changerecommended changes to 00this issue focuses on three areas of changes to improve gameplay in 00 sovereignty warfare1 improvements to sovereignty warfarechanging the sovclaiming structure from moonanchored pos to planetanchored bases2 raidable logisticssupport infrastructureremove sovereigntyclaiming from moonanchored pos reduce automated defenses and move most modules outside control tower shield to open them up to attacks by raiding subcap gangs pos would then be focused on specific nonsov claiming roles such as miningindustry jump bridge cyno jammer planetary defense3 invader toolstitan rebalancingto account for the above changes removal of aoe effect from doomsday device to be replaced with singletarget anticapship weapon and staging area shield abilitythese three areas of change combined are intended to make sovereignty warfare more fun and multifaceted and provide for better gameplay at the siege level as well as offer tangible raiding objectives for small subcapital gangsimprovements to sovereignty warfarethis change primarily hinges on moving the basis of sovereignty from moonanchored pos to planetanchored bases supported by planetary defense modules anchored on separate grids surrounding the planet a new siege mechanic is introduced to make epic battles over these planetary bases more interestingthe planetary basethe planetary bases primary purpose is to establish sovereignty over a solar system secondary roles could include acting as a fuel depot for pos at moons in orbit around the planet to ease fueling logistics additional functions could also be addedwhen attacked the planetary base follows much the same path as current pos siege mechanics with one new additionupon the expiration of the reinforcement timer five planetary defense modules anchored in separate grids surrounding the planet come online in order for the main fleet to inflict damage on the planetary base 3 of the 5 pdms must be disabled when disabled via damage a pdm will go into a short 510 minute downtime to repair itself once repaired it will come back online and resume supporting the planetary base thus attacking forces must continuously suppress the pdms around the base while the main siege force attacks the base itselfthe defending force must anchor the pdms but they are dormant and can be scanned down but cannot be targeted until the planetary base exits a reinforcement timeroptions for making the pdm mechanic even more interesting include having them govern the heavy guns that defend the planetary base so that suppressing them deactivates the guns to aid the main siege forcenew roles of moonanchored player owned stations  raidingwith the movement of sovereignty mechanics to planetary bases moonanchored pos are free to be refocused as logisticssupport facilities and can be rebalanced to be targets for smaller raiding forces to inflict financial and logistical damageautomated defenses can be downgraded to be on a level consistent with attacks by small to medium size subcapital gangs facilities at the pos are made vulnerable to attack in a fashion similar to station services so that raiding forces that can infiltrate enemy territory can inflict financial damage by halting production research moonmining theft of resources etc actual destruction of modules requires the destruction of the control tower itself
the economic model of moonanchored pos should be reexamined with these changes to account for the potential disablement of facilities or theft of resources via raiding the balance and risk of spreading industrial activity across a broad area out of response reach of defending forces vs a smaller better secured area should be a definite choice decreasing of maintenance costs perhaps via discounts through collective fueling at planetary bases are recommendedthe potential for stargate anchored gate guns similar to those found in lowsec can be considered  so that raiding forces with aggression towards the sovereign alliance will be under fire during their escape from enemy territoryinvader toolstitan rebalancingto accompany the above changes a new tool must be added to the arsenal of invading forces and the aoe damage element of the doomsday device must be changed these two changes can be taken together to give a new tool to the titan in exchange for reducing the power of its signature weaponin place of the aoe damage element of the doomsday device it is recommended that the device be changed to a powerful singletarget blast designed to be attack enemy capitals and supercapsin addition to provide for increased ability to stage forces in enemy systems prior to sieges a poscaliber shield is recommended as a new module for the titan allowing it to temporarily create a safe zone in empty space to act as a staging ground with this addition the titan will truly be a mobile battle stationconclusiontaken together these changes will improve the fun and variety of warfare in 00 space for all levels of force deployment  from the raiding small gang all the way up to the epic siege battle
i think fahtim can just post it when were happy with it the fact that it is a collaborative effort and were all supporting it will help and toman can follow up with his faq
kelsinunsecured by policing language that will unnecessarily evoke a bad reaction try out of the reach of fastresponding defenders or something the implication is that that the defense vs raiders is an eventdriven thing just like fighting any other hostile roaming gang and no one expects people to patrol their territory if people want to warp from tower to tower in the territory on the offchance they encounter an enemy gang more power to them but most people will balk at the suggestionalso not all planets have 5 moons many planets have none the pdms just need to be place offgrid 1 au away from the planetary base or something
sounds good ill make some editsedit done let me know if i missed anything
you go ahead and post it youre the author here ill support ofc and ill add my two isk plus some links to key posts in these discussions when i get a chancealso my account is gonna lapse soon so i wont be checking often
lol you cause lag in busy systems too does that mean ccp should turn ship graphics into stick figures wouldnt it be cool if you logged in one day and everything sun space stations planets ships objects looked like stick figures drawn by a 5 year old on a blackboard but hey no lag methinks maybe asteroids is your gamemaybe try turning all the effects stuff off and see if half the problem is your machine that there is server side lag in fleet battles is an old horse that has already been beaten to death several thousand times blaming missiles and drones is laughable its a hardware issue please feel free to stop by the biomass recovery unit on your next login
yes to the first question and no to the second questiondrones are piddly small they are fast hard to target and hard to hit one single drone even if it was as small and as fast but did 5x the damage would mean someone would just need to get one lucky shot in to do several drones hps worth of damage in one good shot or would not need to acquire a new target making it easier to take them down also require them separate if you want to run multiple types of drone or attack multiple targetsi see what you are saying about drone lag and performance but there are good gameplay reasons to keep drones as they are suspect the answer is better math processing server side there is a cost to having a single server with so many players  and that cost is massive amounts of parallel processing required
in this case only one delegate felt strongly enough about the issue to pass it so personally i consider it 19 and fail
like i said irrational abstention  opposition both are clearly defined and they are fundamentally different
i just dont think abstention should be an option at all for delegates in a 9 member csm if there were a few dozen then individual abstention would not be a problemi agree that abstention and opposition stem from different motives but in this context they should have the same effect on a vote
abstaining in a vote is the act of withholding ones vote while at the same time acknowledging ones presence during the vote thus a vote is not cast but the voter is still counted as being present for the purposes of among other things verifying a quorum exists during the vote a vote in which 8 people abstain and one person votes up or down is decided by the one person who voted up or downthis is the protocol used throughout the world regardless of the size of a quorum abstention is neither opposition or support im genuinely puzzled this is still an issue in regard to the csm meetings youd think if it were the csm representatives might have availed themselves of the international expertise found in the moderator used during the csmccp iceland meeting yall ought to look it up theres certainly enough documentation on the subjectwindjammer
i know of a couple bodies that ban abstention so it is possible however given the nature of the meetingstaking place over a chat channel someone who wants to vote abstain but cant will just vote afk instead and theres no way to disprove it banning it is thus entirely pointless and thus it should be allowed so that we at least get a record of the abstention rather than someone just trying to sneak one by
you guys are confusing me  didnt ccp get back to them and say that it takes 5 yes votes to escalate period in that case an abstention is the same as a no because its withholding a yes vote
then ccp is being irrational too also im pretty sure that they did not say that because 47 is sufficient seriously people dont force a chiltern hundreds solution on the council
well technically an issue can be escalated with 4 votes if we are sitting on bare quorum of 7 csmalternates but it takes 5 if we have 8 or the full nine and yes ccp did tell us that they intended abstentions having no role in the council voting
yay ccp
now if only i could get a little thumb up of approval for your post
you need to email modsccpgamescom they arent omnipresent ive sent em an email rest is up to them comedy thread though 00 is easy lolzor if it was so easy 80 of the server population wouldnt be sitting in empire
the seats are more comfy there
i have been playing eve for 3 months now and i think there is something missingwhen i read discussions about bigger ships getting more useless versus smaller ships and drones so i got the following thing in my mind does a real battleship turns its 16 guns on an airplane  becouse that pilot would be laughing itself to death no its has special guns to take down airplanes 50 cal and  20mm uss washington had 65 30mm and 50mm cannons and nowadays phalanx and goalkeeper systems and that leads to the following idea maybe it is possible to create close range defence turretsguns that would work on the same principle as defenders1 or just work like a turret that spreads fire through an area the size of an small smatrbomb radius21  a type of ammoeating gun that shoots lowcalibre explosive shells very fast 5 shot bursts at every 12 secs at anything at close range missiles drones and ships very low damage to ships becouse the ships armor and shields would be too strong to penetrate 1 damage but of course with very low accuracy a high tracking speed but a wide spread so that is has a change to hit it but not a high change what would result in a very lucky hit to hit a missile and that it will hit a drone with luck but that would happen more often becouse there longer around you  they would do more damage to drones then to ships somewhere 110 depends on how close they hit and the calibre  of course the bigger the ship the bigger the defense guns would be example a frigate would have around 10mm explosive shells with an explosion radius of about 5m and an battleship woud go towards 50mm explosive shells with about 1520m radius so it haas a higher change to hit but it also needs bigger ammo  higher costs2  this idea works more like the style you would see in battlestar galactica guns that just shoot explosive shells anywhere withing an radius  1000 for firgate up to 3000 for a battleship this would of course be firing faster and probably couse bad vision or lagg in greater numbers and cost more ammo the turrets would then take up a turret or a high slot probably a turret slot creating new slots would probably result in a great deal of designing also the amount of turrets would also bepend on the sise of the defense turret  1 turret on a small sizes defence turret  frigate destroyer 2 turets on medium sized turret cruiser battlecruiser  and 4  on a large sized defence turret battleship and even more for capital ships the dots between the   would be turrets on a single turret slotand of course battleship or capital sized defence guns would do more damage to small ships but more to scare off light ships to let them get some distance so that they are easyer to hit with long range weapons then to really destroy themwould probably result in something like this  defence gun this would greatly increase the ability to defend yourself agains drones and battleships versus frigatesinterceptors and of course cargo haulers would probably love to have it at least i would now whats your opinion on this
you could just down size the turrets on ur current ships to medium or small use light drones to kill drones smartbombs kill droneseve already had this option its just making it avliable by thinking outside the boxjust my personal opinon
streamlining the council and issuesi have been on about this a few times by now but one of the major issues that is being had with the council at present as i see it is how issues are handled what interesting is is that its fairly easy to put them into fine boxes in a sensible way and i frankly think that is what is needed in order to make the council more effectivelooking at the issues being raised we see following types of issues feature ideas fixes wantedcorp ui being wanted drone behaviour being bad etc questions about certain thingsalliance tournament for instance ships modifications everything elsein order to make the task of putting together and answering all these things we need to streamline the handling what the csm can do is fairly simple tell the difference between them all and submit them in different wayslets try and look how it would workfeature ideas these documents would flesh out the aspects of the feature and how it would benefit the game the current document we have is very well suited for thisfixes wanted it should describe the current mechanics faults and shortcomings it will have to describe how it would work out better eventually by giving examples or ideas for how else it could work for instance in the case of the corp ui some graphicswizard could pump out a few drafts for how the ui could lookquestions these are easily put into a list of questions rather than being fully fleshed out like feature these would be submitted to ccp as one big list and answer is expected to be handed back on the first day of meetings no discussion should be had on all topics unless 1 the csm has questions for ccp or 2 ccp didnt understand the question or wanted further feedback on the questionships modification link preferably the amount of these should be extremely limited if not done at all but the streamlining idea for this would be to submit a document which contains a description of the issue with the ship as well as providing ideas for how to change the attributes this should be formatted in the same way as patchnotes on ships changes are doneeverything else should be using our current standard documentthis will allow the council to be more effective in regards to getting questions to ccp and for ccp to answer them all thus its mutually beneficial to everybody what do you people thinkcredits sheriff jones for coming up with the streamlining idea for getting answers to simple questions
personally i think youre working along the right lines vista however id have to disagree on the ship modification partthere are too many people on these forums who have a i know everything about eve attitude and think they know how to balance the game better than ccp im still firmly of the belief that the csm should not advocate ship or race changes at all but focus more on new content development and game mechanics streamlining such as the overhaul of pos the overhaul of the sovreignty system and the removal of bugs and issues with the game and its enginetoo many people seem to be using the csm foums as a way to show their hate of the latest fotm fittings and ultimately its wasting the csms time ccp play the game if there are issues with ships theyll adjust them as appropriate
ship mods should be called balancing issues either way we should escalate replacement of the forums to a web20 solution
proof that ss works in marketing
do you differentiate between the following issueslets change the power grid on the night hawkversuswe need to rethink the titan ddorlets rethink cap ship roles so that they dont directly obsolete subcapitals for so many purposes
yes those are different kinds of issues
is there anything regular joes ought to do in accordance with what you wroteis there some place where we can see the submission document formats you use
nope not at all this is all something that has to be done by the council the current submission format we use is right here
well we could start a trend of instead of putting issue in front of thread titles puttingfeaturefixquestionbalanceto indicate what kind of topic it is
i approve of both kelsins and lvvs ideas here and serenity you already have escalated a thread entitled fix the forums i should hope thats enough it was generic i admit but im sure ccp and everybody else knows exactly what i meant
theyre different kinds of issues however as far as ccp are concerned theyre all lumped under the balancing category and smart enough  need to work out a solution for themselves and come back to the playersi agree on the point about the forums replacement already been raised enough to be the dead horse were already flogging ps i work in the internetmobile industry not marketing
starting trends ftw
i have mixed feelings on this its an interesting idea but it also seems geared toward giving a sizable advantage to the defenders and their friends
its actually not that bad of an idea
it makes sense that people who own the space and who have installed the proper intelligence infrastructure to have an intelligence advantage
i agree completely in fact it would we strange not toi like this idea but im interested in how recon ships would affect this network idea would system survey be some innate ability would it be improved by some skill andor do you need to install a module on your recon ship
very interesting idea 22 questions1 how do you see this impacting the mobility of players within the eve universeeg will players and corporations will tend to stick in one location because of the barrier to establishing such intelligence2 if players tend to stay in one systemconstellationregion what would be the impact of that on21 trade eg more differentiation in markets22 player experience eg i played eve for 2 years and never left my systemconstellationregion
interesting idea  obviously needs some working on but bookmarked to check out at a later date
amazing few players are able to give this detailed of an example i think the csm should pick this up simply because it is very well thought out obviously needs a little bit of tweeking to work effectivlyone recomendation from me have a level 0 base network in each system regardless of sec status that shows number of ships only not friendly or hostile status just the number of ships and how many are entering  leaving
i dont think it will have this kind of negative effect it will just cause people to be smarter and more cautious as they move around if intelligence was gathered and distributed depending on standing towards the sovereignty holding npc faction or player alliance it would still act as an early warning sign to rightful minersratters and would give incentive to hold space and interact diplomatically
bump great idea why is no one still talking about this
because weve already supported itkeep them coming
we have not yet send our second batch of issues to ccp it was supposed to be included in the first but there was made a mistake which made it not arrive on time

not going into long talk here is the problem should you be a pilot that has negative standings for a certainany pirate faction it is impossible to raise the faction standing back up again if it is below 2empire agents appear to work like this 1 faction standing below 2  unable to use faction agents 2 positive standings acquired through gang missioning to a corp  can use that corps agents 3 gangs can be used to get ruined factional standings back up by doing storyline missions00 pirate agents appear to work like this 1 same as empire agents 2 positive standings acquired through gang missioning to certain npc corp  still cannot use even that corps agents if faction standing below 2 3 cannot acquire faction standings through gang storyline missionscurrent solutions are1 dont ruin the standings2 get another account or make another char on the same account and train that up to do the missionsthat being said we all start in empire and most of us run missions to make money when we get enough of empire and decide to move to 00 if any us want to do missions for pirate factions most of us are limited to choose from them and some cant do any pirate missions and there isnt any way to get pirate faction standings back up there should be a way to do thatsolutions1 make it possible to gain factional standings to pirate factions by doing gang storyline missions2 if not storylines then at least make it so that if you have a positive standing gained by gang missions to a npc pirate corp that its agents alone can be used3 some way to level out pirate faction standings perhaps getting sufficient amount of some sort of dog tags and donating them to the pirate factions as bribes that allow to get them to 1 or even 199 to be able to use the worst agents of that factions corps at least4another solutionedit this is not taking criminal connections or diplomacy skills into account if those are taken into account then you can have more that 2 with a pirate faction and be able to use their agents
the obvious fix is to have gang completion of storyline missions result in faction standings changes for all members of the gang the fact this isnt in place at the moment is actually rather perplexing  it makes negative standings absolutely irrecoverableand large swathes of empire thus absolutely inaccessible with no possible recourse assuming you annoy the allied factions enough as wellwhich is of course entirely possible i dont like actions that cannot be fixed somehow

how have i not supported this yet i think they need more of a boost than you suggest but that is a minimum
hell yeah
a must
blackops shouldnt be a solo pwnmobilei am all for boosting blackops fuelefficiency jump range and jump mechanics cyno into jammed systems but not their offensivedefensive capability in my mind the blackops class is along the logistics theme hence why it can jump other ships in  let the force recons and stealth bombers do all the fightingre deep space transports  solo transportmobile 35k of cargo could the jump harmonics flag be introduced here make the dsts useful to bring along but still require more fuel than other ships of the same mass increased cargohold offset by increased fuel usage
sounds good
nanos may need a bit of toning down but these changes are absurd
against but only because it seems ccp will bork it all up worse with their proposed changes than it already is
againstthe intention is good but the approach is all wrong dont nerf speed as an entirety just because its being used generously in pvp and lets all face it blobs are not fun if i hadnt already given up pvp for the foreseeable future i would threaten to give up pvp insert angry fist shaking here

cheers felystasheer insanity a scrambler shutting down your microwarp drive will turn all frigs into flying coffins
yes primary and secondary sounds good ill throw in a third suggestion which would be for the skills to bleed on to the next one if you dont switch over obviously to the maximum level v and then stop
two options should be avail primary and secondary skills this is give flexibility for players and makes players logon the second option should be the 1  5 skill training and it should be the default setting edited cuz im stupid
sounds good im going to have to agree with ccp that it encourages people to log in and capping the queue at somewhere around 2472 hours sounds like a good idea
supportthe skill queuing is a great idea especially for those skills that are 40 days means that you can you dont have to be single minded all dayalso those of us that cant play 237 and work keeps you away for weeks at a time  it means that we can train more skills when away instead of rubbish long skills that you dont need but you have to train somethingi dont like the idea of capping the days training though i prefere the idea of them both training at half speed but the ability to train 1 at normal speed
alot of the caldari missile shps have visable missile launchers on them built in to the design model ccp just needs to move the missile spawn points to those spots on the shipand as for the turrets not hitting but visably hitting yes needs fixed
come on ccp quality over quantityedit cant spell for 
i completely agree with this
iv lived in all security systems and this will help with 00 a whole lot in counting how many hostiles v friendlies there isbut on the pirate side if u jump into a system u wount see there name or show info i think to big of a wall to read and im bored lol so i dnt no which to do suggest or not d
short answer no players have their default sevice at their starter faction if that is not enough subscribe for a better playernpc service for some isk and done join a corporation or alliance and you will get the necessary local serviceill attempt to presage what would happen if local servicing would come onlinein 001a after the happy ganking time the main difference would be the more usage of recon ships and amount of pos fuel most of the people in 00 can take care of themselfes those who would be sticked to one location because of gameplay change are already sticked to one anyways1b less soloing more gang work1c there are many politically claimed but actually unused solar systems in eve since local servicing at level3 sould be way more expensive in fuel than lvl2 and lvl1 these probably would not been used at maximum level to save resources so i would not expect maximum level of local service everywhere also a real covered system needs more than 1 network hub in a system because losing the only one could cause loss of intelligence for the system to avoid this big territory claimer alliances could reconsider employing smaller entities in unused areas in exchange of high level intelligence service this could get more people into 00in low sec1d agent runnersnpcersminers could make an own high level servicing level3 network which provides them just as more safety than right now actually much more compated to strangers or they could join a faction network which is easy and moreless free1e those who are around in low sec are probably sticked to a faction so they have faction networks as alternative if they dont have or they are changing position frequently they will use player connections alts recon ships to get intel subscribing to a public network should be question of isk in most casesin high sec1f concord network and the starter factions network should be enough to get some fortitude and press the jump button on the client pirates should have a slight disadvantage here since they are banned form concord network but they should not belong to hisec anyways also everyone has alts and many people have 2 or more accountssince i dont see a chance this happen actually i should skip this but here are my answers in case im wrong21 market is an interesting question but not as much as it sounds at first i dont think that neural networking would cause a great impact to trading since most of the trading is managed in highsec and by noobcorp alts most of the trading would stay untouched use concord network and you will be fine for the rest like moving stuff from low sec to high sec this system would force people to work in groups get scouts and recon ships use your relationships 00 corporations would take the intel organising barrier easily imho22a all what would change is just teamwork loners are the only who might be in trouble but as i stated before many time there is no need of having an own intel source pay and subsribe to a service 22b if ten people are playing together i cant imagine local service subsription can cause any serious problem generally joining a corporation where there are a bit more experienced pilots shows directions and solves the no access problem less soloing more teamwork that sould be the way
about recon ships first i was thinking on an innate abilitysolution but i found this too easy and recon ships were everywhere soonerlater instead of pos modulesthen later 1 cpu1 pwr module fit only like covops cloak with fuel consumption with a nice balance this is still a good idea but players would not like it much since there are just enough logistics in the game i agree let the players just playso i was thinking a lot on this currently id say that recon ships and covert ops class ships should be able to fit a high slot module which fulfills the hub role for combat recon ship this module could give local level 2 for force recon ship level 2 while uncloaked and local level 1 while cloaked for covert ops this module should mess up the whole ship setup but it could provide local level1 while uncloaked by this way cover ops could be the poor mans the dude who is on low sp and isk scoutwith a system like this the force recons were sitting cloaked all day long in hostile systems so i was thinking on fuel consumption for cloaked state to give a chance to the defenders and also a couple seconds of startup delay for the magic module after decloakalso there should be probes a good placeholder name is needed these could be launched from recon launchers and could provide local service on 123 levels there should be at least two types from each short and long the first type could give intel instantly for a shorter time period while the second could give the same information for a longer time period but with a startup delaymanaging an own network also would require netural networking skill or something like that it should work similarly to corporation management but easier to be learnt and on wider scale while probably you wont have 20 000 corporation members in the near future its not hard to imagine that 5 000  10 000 people are using a same source of intel it would be terrible if at startup noone had the skills and people were flying blind in 00 i was thinking on new skills but i stucked at better probes require better skills mysterious local generator module requires less fuel on each level probes stay alive longer at each skill level less cpu to fit  etc etclater if it is needed ccp could implement the space brothersister version of awacs this could happen with the recon ships like it happened with the interdictors dictorheavy dictor reconforce reconuber recon this could have the onboard local scanner by default in exchange of paper armor or something
nice ideasigned
i like the idea it would make eve a lot more interestingsigned
thanks for all who likes my idea if you really like to support this please clickyclicky to the check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on  checkbox also in your comments just above your name 
i like your initiative and the work you put in it but there are a few things i disagree withthe biggest issue i have is tools a defending player has over an attacker its a common sense idea as it comes naturally to any person who wants to come up with things relating to it currently we have too many defending advantage tools and not enough attacking tools many of these tools are tied to sovereignty and poses which are great in the aspect that they are unique to the game and ideally tie into directly home turf vs attacker but just as it does that it leads us into the blob warfare assigning more tools to a pos an addition to the current problems we have is a bad thing and promotes more blobbing this is depsite your suggestion of multiple networksideally i think its an interesting idea in its own right however in the current format of eve i do not think its appropriate to add in if there were many other features given to attackers then maybe i would reconsider itdespite that i also think level 3 should be level 4 as ship types are too much information level 3 is not all too uncommon in terms of sovdespite my reservations i do like is the feel of it though it seems somewhat more immersive over current local lists into what it would be like flying about in a spaceshipi believe eccm makes you harder to detect on a probe so maybe your signal strength andor signature should have something to do with it a higher priority on eccm would be interesting although it would make it even harder on raiders as they would be required to use more slots on tools they need to do the job they already have to fit for tackle and propulsion on top of regular fittings a tie into black ops battleships and covert cynos delaying things would be interestingdo cloaks prevent detection theninstant info maybe should be delayed a few seconds after decloaking so if cloaks do people have the opportunity to use them and gain the use of themi am not sure if i didnt catch it in the read but could you use a recon class vessel as its own neural network patching in info to your gang into local they are recons ya know the possiblity of hacking networks also would be interesting false positives and crazy stuff like that could be greatso there is potential in your idea really though i am not sure if you would agree to go with it where i am thinking
think ive post this in the wrong placebut stillfor those of you that arent aware your corporation wallets have several divisions allowing for seperate funds to be setup and to make it easier for the corp to work towards a goalwhy cant we have personal wallets the same allow us to split our personal wallets into several divisions so that those of us already in a corp and dont want to branch off and create our own 1 man corps can do the same ever been half way through buying fittings in jita and run out of isk ever been trying to save for that expensive module  ship but you keep piing it up the walltrying to save all your bounties so that you can afford the uber expensive skill book why is the carrier skillbook more than the dreads btw if we could split our personal wallets you could always find that extra isk that you hid away months ago so what does everyone think
great idea i would love the ability to tuck money away in random spots we dont need as many as the corp walle has but maybe 3 divisions main wallet backup and savingsand since they did it with the corperation wallet you know it is possible and easy to implimentps phoenix493 please support your idea
hehe good point  i fully support this
good idea some people would get a lot of mileage out of the extra tracking that would provide make it so that theres an option on where particular income streams would come intoout of  say if i want mission isk to come into division 1 sales isk to go into division 2 and expenses to come out of division 3
yes pleaseonly reason i am in a 1 man corp these days is because i need those corp divisional wallets to keep my different business ventures funds seperatewith divisional wallets for my personal wallet i would have the luxury of being able to join a real player corp
must be done so
nice ideasupport topicalso a true long shot awaits flame moar figther skills p
probably but it has only been a month since they posted ccps replyi would expect some form of implant within the next 5 months or as soon as the next large patch deploymentmaybe
this please t2  named gear would be great to see in addition to drone implants another idea for an implant would be for providing the user with more drone bandwidth for example 5mb 10mb and 15mb of drone bandwidth per respective level of implanti assume what you mean by micha is the michis excavation augmentation or some such implant for another 5 mining laser yield which i believe sells on various markets for around five hundred million isk it isnt so much rare in my opinion as that there is only one place to get it and each character can only claim it once providing they meet the conditions to do so
about time
ja ja nerf it
chchchchchangesturn and face the strain
i do support this nerfalthough i must admit i do miss the dual mwd ravens
nerf the nanos
bump for great justicealso checking that ive given my support
and make shorcuts for this
here is my input to the csm submission documentintrosupport for slash commands already existed within the eve clients interface eg used for autopilot during beta and gms on a daily basisareas affectedmacro minersthere is a risk that players using macros may increase with the simplified requirements to only send slash commands rather than the more complex memory cache and pixel reading required today hardware balancing vs advantageowners of programmable keyboards such as logitech g15 will be able automatically script ship movements eg for scouting spying etceg destination hedgpautopilot shortcut keywait 20 secondsdestination keberezautopilot shortcut keyloopon the other hand with introduction of slash commands to support andor extend all the configurable shortcuts would actually have a levelling effect between players that dont have sufficient keys on their keyboard to enable all short cuts and those with programmable keyboardspotential solutionsreenable rights for players to use slash commands however do not enable any flight control operations that are not already included in the keyboard shortcutsfocus first on slash commands for all the features listed in the client configurable shortcuts
yes sounds nice
and do not forget to add a penalty on the rigs that currently have none
why
signed
ccp read the op
i am very interested in hearing what the devs say about this
support
station hugging must be balanced as well as station campingdockundock games are annoying
i like it
looks like the best way to fix the nano problem
not signedas soon as i sore the mwd turns of all guns and drones i thought wtfwe are trying to reduce nano speed not completly get ride of them this will make ships like interceptors go obsolete id rather have ccps idea than this crap
proposal was voted down by the csm 27 ank and i voted yes but the others were not convinced specific bit of the meeting log covering the issue is here sorry but i tried
bump because this is still an issue
i fully support this limitations of missions per day per agent wont affect the average player but the 237 mission grinderthe whine will be loud so ccp wont remove bounty and loot completely maybe reduce bounty and loot and give out more lp lp balance themselves like tags if the faction item market is full of modules the value of lp will automatically drop
yes there is to many goons with 5 implants doing mission in hi sec
create some new systems that cant be found on the map but deep in 00 the gates can be scanned down with some difficulty i might add this leads to a hidden system that might house something of value a storyline or anything really they could be placed in systems that arent used very often and some triggers that make them difficult to find ancient ruins of civilisations with new technologies rare minerals and objects to be mined or found derelict space stations hazards or alien species nonhuman alien races anomalies wormholes that jump your ship from one side of the galaxy to another
i support this idea a smaller and a bit faster freighter would be very useful for small corps and minersi can even see some use in low sec for pos maintanace
sounds like something to investigate further
it would be a great help and save a lot of faffing
perhaps even have the icons of insured and uninsured ships different colors in the hanger
low sec needs a boostpirates need a change gatecamping must be reduced sentries fortified pirates need to use probes and scannersjust what the people said before me in this thread
pretty self explanatoryskills for drone damageskills for drone speedskills for drone resistanceskills for drone controlthank you
what try looking at what skills there are already1 there are plenty of skills for drone damage drone interfacing combat drone operation sentry drone operation  drone specialization heavy drone operation and plenty of ships have drone damage bonuses2 drone speed  drone navigation3 drone resistance  theres already drone durability it does the same thing4 drone control   you mean drone control range number of drones controlled the ability to give drones different commands for drone control range theres scout drone operation and electronic warfare drone interfacing number of drones controlled was originally what drone interfacing did but drones lagged everything too much so they made it give a 20 boost to drone damage per level which is effectively the same thing and finally if you want new drone commands youd have to be more specific
oops haha
i have long supported various kinds of drone love but i dont really think its needed in this case maybe a resistance skill or an ewar strength skill since those are about the only ones lacking right now but most of the ones you proposed are redundant and unnecessary
drones are fine
1 thing rogue drone faction shipsi want a rogue drone domi with fewer turret hardpoints but crazy drone bonuses and a mean tank
well drone navigation only ups drone mwd speed i think since otherwise the drones get a tracking problem so how about a drone tracking skill  would be a nice to have for sentrys and heavys and how about a skill that reduces drone signature  would be a nice to have as well
a skill that increases optimal and orbit distance would be nice
you mean a faction domi whit double of moros bonuses d
aye
this is an exploit in my opinion thanks
even though i use this its obviously not fair
the op solution need refinement as it is stated you have an unacceptrable rule that infringes upon the freedom of players not using the war tactic the solution must be tailored to fit the scenario better would be to put the 24 hour clock on any player that engages in combat with a war target this would prevent the scenario given in the op it would also allow those who never actually participated in any war action to freely leavealso per player war dec tags are very unacceptable if my ceo goes insane and war decs a bunch of merc corps i surely aint gonna hang around to see how that goes and i dont want his night of drunkeness to follow me around the game for weeks
no more corphopping ccp youve been nerfing pvp and buffing carebears for three patches now buff pvp
exactly our ceo was a target for the fact of his mission running ship might drop his expensive boosters or such they didnt and its gonna cost like hell to replace i personally think the tactic of having a dummy alt create a corp and the other character jumps in at will then leaves without penalty just as fast is underhanded dishonest and to be truthful an exploit granted the ccp gms dont see it as such or at least not all of them but i want this fixed its one thing to have one or two characters our of ten or twenty to leave a corp because of war but to have one lousy character jump out kill a target jump into station and leave the corp in the span of less than an hour is stupid my solution add basic kill rights in a warsorta if the character who did the killing leaves his corp within 24 hours of the shippod kill it should automatically give the killed party a standard kill right makes it a tiny bit more fair and not hard to implementkevin
ya must be so
this tactic should be named an exploit
my corp a single player hisec corp with a pos for research was also decced by an week old corp with a single alt in it rather than see my pos go poof i moved on with my main and pos and left these two alts to fight the battle totally lame should be named as an exploit i actually petitioned it and was told that its ok bah
definite exploit per person wardecs could get complicated though

1 i wouldnt be supprized if the account was not only banned but deleated as well by now2 he most likely has new accounts3 ccp will probably never do this just as they never really do anything that players ask
you all clearly dont remember the original intention of the csmlink to the original for those who want itas you can see he originally envisioned that the csm would help deal with such issues as the t20 incident and the  issuehe went to ccp with the problem first and they dismissed him immediately then he put it on his website publicly and ccp began looking into and asked him to take it down he did and then all his accounts were banned so he put the information back on his sitethe bpos were not removed until t20 was forced to apologize in a dev blog that was roughly 8 months after the issue was discoveredwhat rules did he break do you have any specifics or is it all your opinion
so you are saying you would prefer the corruption to continue we will ignore the fact youre named in several issues what if it had been red alliance that got the free bpossaying that because people got upset for him ruining something they got illegitimately whether they knew or not is a reason to get rid of him and keep corruption is insane i mean what else do you wantyes you are right they can prevent people from playing for whatever reason they want just because they can doesnt make it a good reason thoughthe only evidence we have is has stated that he himself does not know why he was banned i dont have a link to the specific post but it was later revealed that he was banned for creating undue workload which was a result of his whistle blowing clearly contradicting kieron they may also be trying to blame him for the threadnaught but one person did not do thatin the end you have very little room to comment on this due to your direct connection to ccp so you should probably avoid making more of a fool of yourself yes i will provide links if you trying calling me out on this
sweet i suggested this a lot when i first started playing amarrgallente nearly have the same skill backgrounds alos minmatarcaldari makes sense to me so yeh totally in support
why do the navy ships need a boost they get 50 hp flat the same two bonuses as everything else and an extra slot of some variety as well plus they only require one races skills to fly not two i wouldnt object to faction bcs though destroyers might be too narrow but bcs are good meaty ships
you say that as if the pirate faction ships did not get a hp boost too in the case of the rattlesnakes shields it is even an almost 100 bonusthe empire factions ships do effectively have one less bonus first nail in their coffin was the addition of rigs which reduced the advantage the additional slot gives on all but the cnr then the addition of marauders has further devalued them so yes i do believe they need a boost in the form of a 3rd bonus for all i care they could also increase the lp cost by 50 to reflect that boost i just want to see them as something special again
mmmm faction bc i like
i agree we need more faction ships and maybe boost ships like navy megathron and others to be more better than maybe a kronos or just match it or at least better than hyperions atm u pay 500 mill for a faction navy mega and it can die easyly to a kronos or hyperion
gallenteamarr  lasers and drones no ammo to lug about
buy a logitech g15 and use macro functions on it 
funky idea
i agree
personally i think interbus should assess a shipping and handling fee to market purchases onlybefore anyone starts ranting just consider itit leaves courier contracts still a viable alternative to getting bulk cargo moved about so you dont have to worry about haulers going out of businessbut it would instantly solve the jita problem when the issue with jita in particular is that everyone wants to cram into the same system to buy and sell their waresyou could manufacture out of one system and list your products locally then anyone within the same region could see yours is the best value they buy it paying a small fee extra in a matter of minuteshours the items are delivered to their own local stationnow no one would have to cram their way into jita there wouldnt be such a thing as a hub anymore since the closest we have to a hub these days is amazon and ebayideas
whats wrong with having a hub it is a naturally occurring phenomenon and one of the cooler things that has evolved in evefixed
naturally because thats the only way the market has functioned to date if you could get items shipped then hubs wouldnt have developed to begin withand dont say courier contracts because they dont work people are idiots they want a freighters worth of cargo moved with a 500bil isk collateral and offer about 350 isk reward after the 50 jumpsand cooler things do you seriously think that jita causing lag so bad that petitions have to be filed to drag characters out of perpetual client crashes is cool
not quitejita is more like the parking lot at a major citys mall everyone trying desperately to find a parking space while avoiding running someone over or getting into a fender bender along the waya hub only shows poor planning and the sheer scale of this particular lack of planning that has lead ccp to dedicate resources specifically to jita itself servers support several star systems worth of activity but jita has its own dedicated servers because they cant see that a hub is actually a bad idea in this case
i would argue that even with the shipping service hubs would exist as the small cost of transport would have a nonignorable cost for cheap bulk items like minerals and fuel
the human brain is a hub of the neural network as are the heart and lungs to the cardiovascular a server is a hub of information going in and out the oceans are the hub of the water cycle hubs are everywhere and will always be the most efficient solution whenever transportation has a cost
the fee could be scaled to fit the purchaseif you are buying in bulk the price shiftsif you are buying very cheap items 25 isk vs 50k isk the price shiftsbut it would all have to stay within reason otherwise people could order several freighters worth of ore and minerals and wind up paying far too much or far too littlei think having the option would at least reduce the strain if you intend on buying a couple modules for a new ship have them delivered it saves the time and effort of going to get them if you are buying fuel and parts for a pos for a month then go get it in cases like that youd only lag based on local mission traffic and other massive shipments
youre missing the key here sir scalethe brain is a hub and how large is it in comparison to the rest of the nerves strip all the nerves from a body and roll them into a ball and the brain will be larger than the bundle of wires youd have leftheart and lungs occupying a good portion of the entire torsothe oceans you mean like the oceans that are the majority of the surface area on the planetfine examples if poorly thought outimagine all the effort your brain heart and lungs perform in the space of your left pinky that one little digit doing all that work keeping you alive and functioning smack that thing with a hammer and youre deadnow tell me that jita one system out of how many really needs to be the hub of the economy in eve
it would certainly decentralize the t2 market a little but the closer an item sits to perfect competition ore minerals being very very close the more centralized it will be unless all costs are eliminated both isk and time  opportunity costs cannot be forgotten
it doesnt need to be but unless all costs of transportation are eliminated there will be a hub and that was my key point
ore and minerals like the stuff thats in any belt in any systemif you could find a nice quiet 05 system or even an 02 system with absolutely no traffic and you could mine that thing all day and night respawn after respawn and then you could just drop the ore and minerals at the nearest station rather than trucking them 20 jumps to the nearest hub
amazon ebaythe internet in generalthe main reason people go to the mall or targetwalmartetc anymore is the instant gratification they want something and they want it nowbut planning ahead and knowing i want one of those but i could probably wait a few days for it leads to people ordering off the internet itll show up at your door and all you did was place an orderhubs develop as a matter of convenience a place where youre pretty sure you could find something in particular but these hubs of ours are no longer convenient they lead people to live odd schedules in the hopes of getting into jita during a lull in traffic or in buying from somewhere else to skip the hassle entirelyagain im sure theyll persist and im sure people will still use them but i think theyll diminish if the option were available for deliverydo you always drive to pizza hut or do you like to sit on the couch in your pajamas and wait for the pizza to come to you
the person buying your minerals has to pay the 20 jump npc transportation coststhat will make your minerals more expensive than the same minerals being sold in his system making it more profitable to sell your minerals at the production hubsthese production hubs will exist because of the mission hubs thanks to the same process
but this now is a different argument which i disagree with you based on fundamentals i dont think any npc service should be introduced where it can be player controlleddelivery systems do exist thanks to corps that use the existing contract system make the contract system better sure but dont introduce npcs
sh on small purchases shouldnt slow down commerce that muchand large purchases like fuel or minerals could be retrieved manually
oh ive argued for and against the contract system but i didnt want to start too much into that here as wellthats why i said interbus could handle market purchases only leaving contracts to handle shipments otherwisethe key flaw with most contracts is the collateral and rewards people ask far too much and dont offer near enough in returnone possible solution is to make the reward automatically calculated based on the asking collateral if you want me to pay 500bil up front then id better be getting more than 350 in return at the other endi understand making a machine to do the work of a man takes away from the man but when the man doesnt do the work the work still needs to get doneim not saying get rid of contracts and make interbus do it all but im saying it would be a solution to a heavily debated problem
this this this a thousand times this try to improve the contract system dont just give up and say just make it an npc game featureim pretty confident ccp shares this playerdriven mindset
our logo was also submitted before the scrapping of the old process we need to know when there will be a new process
yes the system should be functional

you miss the point  we fight and we win or we lose there is no hiding or moving to an npc corp were suddenly ninjas not whatever corp youre inwhy ask theyre not his or her wrecks as far as im concerned theyre mine im cleaning up space after themmission runners work dont make me laugh
you seem more intelligent from your other posts to even bother defending that thats an idiots argument you dont need to stoop to that level pthats your opinion i can respect that and to a degree even agree with it why let salvage go to waste on the other hand if a runner wants the salvage and is going to put forth the time skills and effort shipsmods to salvage and loot the wrecks that they put the effort into createing then they should have access to them even an idiot can see that side of the argument and if you cant see and agree to some point that view i wonder where any of the intelligence from some of your other well thought and worded posts come fromwhile i can appreciate the time skills shipsmods it takes to scan down salvage this is the work created by the runner and should have some ownership to it and this really gets me  the most boreing part of running a mission is the loot and salvage yeah thats part of the mission thanks to the big decrease in value of drops and bounty to say running a mission is such easy work and salvaging is so hard then why are you salvagingthe only danger you have is being a complete  and upsetting someone unless you warp into the mission area while the mission is ongoing which in my view is like opening your parents door catching them in the act your invadeing their sanctity and embarassing yourself where as being some lame drone shooting ships is actually taking percision keeping up a tank shooting the right ships at the right time and even though you do it time after time the 1 time you screw up you loose your ship no recourse no vindication no revenge depending on the salvager if npcs get him then the same situation if its the mission runner then you have a chance at getting a much better salvage p im not saying its overly difficult but if you think salvaging is on any scale more difficult i cant think of anyway that it is both things take time and effort and the risk on either side is looseing your ship which if someone knows what their doing at either its pretty much 0 risk
if people want that salvage and loot then they should pick it upif it is left there abandoned then it should be free game if you truly cared bout the loot then pick it uptheres plenty of salvagers willing to follow you and run clean up in your wake for a small cutif you arent going to take advantage of these services then dont complain when one of them does this service anyway frankly loot shouldnt belong to anyone either all it is is floating garbage so you shouldnt stand in the way of those who want to collect the garbage

while i understand your logic and thinking i still tend to disagree if a ccp chairman was put in place and the delegates selected to act as csm members then i feel the csm would run better purely because it would actually be someones job to organise the meetings set the agenda from what the delegates brought to him and make sure that it was kept tothere can still be ideas bounced backwards and forwards between the delegates with no problem at all the fact there is a csm chairman from ccp wouldnt stop that or stop you from talking to eachother all it would mean is that there was a more direct level of ccp interaction than a meeting in iceland every so often and persistant and unbiased format to the meetings and their agendas

there is a suspicion that the op has a bee in his bonnet and loves lasers
missed that bit thanks for the update for some reason i even thought a quorum during a csm meeting was 9 csmalternatespity ccp ruled that way on the abstentions they served a useful purposewindjammer

eve doesnt have the gear you seek but it does fill the role fit small guns smartbombs light drones or fly with friends another form of point defence is unnecessary
bbosmanone thing you forget is that a few 1 or 2 small craft you are wanting to shoot down like in those pics can actually sink a bs or a carrier frigates within this game would be be very hard pressed to do so so drones would be you best bet
1 fit smaller guns2 carry dronesor3 travel with backup this is a multiplayer game after all a single ship isnt meant to handle any and all situations that arise battleships are huge but they arent impervious thats why a couple of tiny frigates will dance around your turret tracking and pick away at you until you die
i completely agree with this
iv lived in all security systems and this will help with 00 a whole lot in counting how many hostiles v friendlies there isbut on the pirate side if u jump into a system u wount see there name or show info i think to big of a wall to read and im bored lol so i dnt no which to do suggest or not d
short answer no players have their default sevice at their starter faction if that is not enough subscribe for a better playernpc service for some isk and done join a corporation or alliance and you will get the necessary local serviceill attempt to presage what would happen if local servicing would come onlinein 001a after the happy ganking time the main difference would be the more usage of recon ships and amount of pos fuel most of the people in 00 can take care of themselfes those who would be sticked to one location because of gameplay change are already sticked to one anyways1b less soloing more gang work1c there are many politically claimed but actually unused solar systems in eve since local servicing at level3 sould be way more expensive in fuel than lvl2 and lvl1 these probably would not been used at maximum level to save resources so i would not expect maximum level of local service everywhere also a real covered system needs more than 1 network hub in a system because losing the only one could cause loss of intelligence for the system to avoid this big territory claimer alliances could reconsider employing smaller entities in unused areas in exchange of high level intelligence service this could get more people into 00in low sec1d agent runnersnpcersminers could make an own high level servicing level3 network which provides them just as more safety than right now actually much more compated to strangers or they could join a faction network which is easy and moreless free1e those who are around in low sec are probably sticked to a faction so they have faction networks as alternative if they dont have or they are changing position frequently they will use player connections alts recon ships to get intel subscribing to a public network should be question of isk in most casesin high sec1f concord network and the starter factions network should be enough to get some fortitude and press the jump button on the client pirates should have a slight disadvantage here since they are banned form concord network but they should not belong to hisec anyways also everyone has alts and many people have 2 or more accountssince i dont see a chance this happen actually i should skip this but here are my answers in case im wrong21 market is an interesting question but not as much as it sounds at first i dont think that neural networking would cause a great impact to trading since most of the trading is managed in highsec and by noobcorp alts most of the trading would stay untouched use concord network and you will be fine for the rest like moving stuff from low sec to high sec this system would force people to work in groups get scouts and recon ships use your relationships 00 corporations would take the intel organising barrier easily imho22a all what would change is just teamwork loners are the only who might be in trouble but as i stated before many time there is no need of having an own intel source pay and subsribe to a service 22b if ten people are playing together i cant imagine local service subsription can cause any serious problem generally joining a corporation where there are a bit more experienced pilots shows directions and solves the no access problem less soloing more teamwork that sould be the way
about recon ships first i was thinking on an innate abilitysolution but i found this too easy and recon ships were everywhere soonerlater instead of pos modulesthen later 1 cpu1 pwr module fit only like covops cloak with fuel consumption with a nice balance this is still a good idea but players would not like it much since there are just enough logistics in the game i agree let the players just playso i was thinking a lot on this currently id say that recon ships and covert ops class ships should be able to fit a high slot module which fulfills the hub role for combat recon ship this module could give local level 2 for force recon ship level 2 while uncloaked and local level 1 while cloaked for covert ops this module should mess up the whole ship setup but it could provide local level1 while uncloaked by this way cover ops could be the poor mans the dude who is on low sp and isk scoutwith a system like this the force recons were sitting cloaked all day long in hostile systems so i was thinking on fuel consumption for cloaked state to give a chance to the defenders and also a couple seconds of startup delay for the magic module after decloakalso there should be probes a good placeholder name is needed these could be launched from recon launchers and could provide local service on 123 levels there should be at least two types from each short and long the first type could give intel instantly for a shorter time period while the second could give the same information for a longer time period but with a startup delaymanaging an own network also would require netural networking skill or something like that it should work similarly to corporation management but easier to be learnt and on wider scale while probably you wont have 20 000 corporation members in the near future its not hard to imagine that 5 000  10 000 people are using a same source of intel it would be terrible if at startup noone had the skills and people were flying blind in 00 i was thinking on new skills but i stucked at better probes require better skills mysterious local generator module requires less fuel on each level probes stay alive longer at each skill level less cpu to fit  etc etclater if it is needed ccp could implement the space brothersister version of awacs this could happen with the recon ships like it happened with the interdictors dictorheavy dictor reconforce reconuber recon this could have the onboard local scanner by default in exchange of paper armor or something
nice ideasigned
i like the idea it would make eve a lot more interestingsigned
thanks for all who likes my idea if you really like to support this please clickyclicky to the check here if you want to give your support to the ideadiscussion going on  checkbox also in your comments just above your name 
i like your initiative and the work you put in it but there are a few things i disagree withthe biggest issue i have is tools a defending player has over an attacker its a common sense idea as it comes naturally to any person who wants to come up with things relating to it currently we have too many defending advantage tools and not enough attacking tools many of these tools are tied to sovereignty and poses which are great in the aspect that they are unique to the game and ideally tie into directly home turf vs attacker but just as it does that it leads us into the blob warfare assigning more tools to a pos an addition to the current problems we have is a bad thing and promotes more blobbing this is depsite your suggestion of multiple networksideally i think its an interesting idea in its own right however in the current format of eve i do not think its appropriate to add in if there were many other features given to attackers then maybe i would reconsider itdespite that i also think level 3 should be level 4 as ship types are too much information level 3 is not all too uncommon in terms of sovdespite my reservations i do like is the feel of it though it seems somewhat more immersive over current local lists into what it would be like flying about in a spaceshipi believe eccm makes you harder to detect on a probe so maybe your signal strength andor signature should have something to do with it a higher priority on eccm would be interesting although it would make it even harder on raiders as they would be required to use more slots on tools they need to do the job they already have to fit for tackle and propulsion on top of regular fittings a tie into black ops battleships and covert cynos delaying things would be interestingdo cloaks prevent detection theninstant info maybe should be delayed a few seconds after decloaking so if cloaks do people have the opportunity to use them and gain the use of themi am not sure if i didnt catch it in the read but could you use a recon class vessel as its own neural network patching in info to your gang into local they are recons ya know the possiblity of hacking networks also would be interesting false positives and crazy stuff like that could be greatso there is potential in your idea really though i am not sure if you would agree to go with it where i am thinking
good idea
supported fully this looks awesome
i dont think ganged storylines are the answer as you would need someone able to get the missions in the first placemaybe introduce or change some existing agents new agents which allow people to do missions to gain standings with the pirate faction ie do 16 missions and get to go to a pirate faction storyline agentthe missions should be scaled on your negative standings 001 to 30 equivalent to level 2 for exampleas your standings with the pirate faction increase the effectiveness of the agent decreases gradually until you can use a normal pirate faction agentas you are generally hated by the pirate faction i think the mission giver would be an astrosurveying agent equivalent giving lots of different types of missions from mining to kill reducing the effectiveness hopefully of macros in grinding pirate lps for ships thus crashing the market in themi think this would allow those who wish to go the pirate faction route whether for rp or other reasons a chance without needing a character who already has pirate faction standings to gang withwhatever else i think the issue needs to be looked at
if its valuable there will be a market in it thats one of the great things about eve if it were possible right now my corp would definitely sell faction standings and i cant imagine were alone in that
incorrect gangs get agentcorp standings but get nothing for assisting in completing storyline missionsyou are right in that your pirate standings by the time you can typically enter 00 are irrecoverable all of mine are 8 or worseimo all mission rats should be of the subfaction type corelli gist ect ect and not have any direct impact on the targeted factionsratting in empire likewise should be against the subfaction rats with standing loss only coming from killing command rats shadow true ect ect based on the size of the ship rather than just the current and rather heavy imo static standing lossi can attack a player and loose like 002 but attack a rat and its like 08 every 15 minutesratting in 00 should have standings loss to that faction exactly equal to your concord security status gain
it should be easier to repair pirate faction than empire id argue there could be a pointofnoreturn for empire but pirates are killers thieves and so on they shouldnt have much problem accepting you even after you blazed a bloody swathe through them for profit  a lot of them probably did the same before joining up
missions have made it to the agenda so ill try to mention this if i cant bring it up ill support it for the next round
while i support the idea of allowing you to fix your standings i dont think that sharing faction standings in a gang is the answer as it makes it too easy to build faction standings on an alti would suggest making the minumum standings requirement variable with agent levelqualitycurrently your highest standing must be level2  quality20  2i would suggest making it so that your lowest effective standing must exceed level2  quality20  7 instead of the current flat 20 minimum standingthis would ensure that you can always work for a level 1 quality 20 agent if you have diplomacy v as such your standings can always be fixedit also rises the barrier of entry for higher level missions that will counter balance the extreme ease which access to those agents has had since the introduction of shared standings gainsby rebalancing the ease of access to those higher level agents it ensures that the road to repentance is not too easy for those who have made an effort to offend an entire faction
so for a l4q20 id need corp standing and faction standing of 2 that seems way too easy i like the idea but i dont think your numbers work im almost tempted to say a l1q160 agent should be added to each factionwith an instation storyline agent somewhere in lowsec and otherwise leave the system as is but really the gang system is a better one  its a smaller change and it makes things work the way that they seem like they should
it theory a change on how easy is to recover faction standing when it is in the deep negative is already under consideration or at least that was some dev said in the threads about faction warfare as fw will destroy a lot of people standing with half of the empires adding something for 00 pirate corps will be only logicanother good change would be to modify belt rats at least in the npc rat regions so that ratting there you will not destroy your standing with the npc station owners
i think you misunderstand what i am suggesting instead of using a fixed value for the lower standings requirement use a formula similar to the upper standings requirement for the lower requirementcurrently a l4q20 agent will not talk to you unless one of your standings is 70 and all three of your standings are 20i am suggesting that a l4q20 agent should not talk to you unless one of your standings is 70 and all three of your standings are 20if you think that my suggestion is way too easy what do you think of the current systemright now starting with no standings at all to gain access to a level 4 agent you only need to share 1530 missions depending on the agents quality with someone who already has access to that agent that is something that i think is way too easyremoving the need to run missions yourself to gain faction standings would be beyond way too easymy suggestion ensures that l1q20 agents are always accessible but also ups the requirements for l3  l4 agents so that it takes more work with lower agents before they are accessible
so you would need an agent standing of 20 to talk to the agent are you saying that people ought to need connections 5 in order to be able to use anything better than a l4q12 i cant support that that said if you amend your proposal to merely change the needed faction standing from 20 to required standing  5 i would actually like that the way too easy comment was due to a misread of your proposal also i dont think missionsharing is a bad mechanic at all for disclosures sake ive used it to get my current agent of choiceand paid a fairly hefty price to my gangmate to do so but i approved of the addition of gang completion well before i started using the system it even makes sense in rp terms  yeah i know hes shot up a lot of your stuff before but hes been really helpful in doing all that stuff you wanted done hes not such a bad guy now is he plus it makes the current system meet expectations  the fact that you only share some standings changes with gangmates is bizarre and counterintuitiveedit named wrong skill
connections v or run 12 missions with a friend as a referal to get the base standings agent standing after all we are talking about some of the best agents availablenow that you mention it a cap on the lower standings requirement would be needed to ensure continued access to level 5 agents dont know where we would want to put that cap 20 00 or 20 but i am sure that any of those would work fine with the suggested formula covering lower quality agentsperhaps excluding agent standings and only applying the minimum requirement to corpfaction standings would work as i doubt there is likely to be too much of a problem with someone declining missions to select the very best plunging their agent standings and retaining access to that agent with corpfaction standings since they will lose standings with all three by declining too many missionsthe big problem with gangsharing faction standings is the possiblity for power leveling faction standings gain currently you must accept the regular missions in order to gain the faction standings while you can get help completing those missions you must be online and playing for all 16 of those regular missions if you could share storyline standings gains you would only need to be online for the one missionhaving shared missions count towards everyone storyline frequency would run similar problems as people would be able to get 10 storyline mission accoss 10 characters by running only 16 missions instead of 160 missions

about cargo  a cargomaximized pilgrim not that that ship can be used for much else nowadays with 5 t2 expanded cargoholds and 2 t1 cargo rigs reaches 1400 mUFFFD while that isnt that terribly much less than a spped optimized blockade runner and far less than a cargo optimized deep space it is still plenty for fuel and possible loot unless you plan to steal a full pos basethe problem i see with a deep space transports is that it can be used to carry a whole pos base with it and i am not sure if ccp wants the main use for black ops ships to establish surprise bases because thats what likely will happen if they can carry large amounts of equipment into hostile territory

putting these fitting jobs up as a regular manufacturing job there would be no more of a load than if we had a number of smalltime producers going at itfitting ships automatically at a factory should take a good while though as to give the manual fitter an edge still
we invented automation machinery and tools generally for a reason there is no need to push people towards doing an easily automatable process by hand
would you trust a machine to pack your parachute for you some things you may want complete control over thats why im proposing leaving the manual fit in for the control freaks among us
im not saying manual fitting should be eliminated its fine im saying there should be no penalty time attached to automatic fitting

damn good idea one more way to alliance overlords to extort the sht out of their plebesgive covops bs this ability as well allowing infiltrators to have an accurate assessment of system activity it shows names standings dockedundockedshielded status but only functions while the bs is cloaked finding  decloaking it kills the infiltrators subinfo networkalso the basic level local network would show activity timer so you know when that cov spy is afk d activity means warping and scanning not just a mousetwitch every 15 seconds or the afk pilot active in multiple random channels ectthe eve client should be more anal about activity timers and detection algorythms and once it suspects a cloaked ship is afk for more than say an hour esp if some activity macro behavior is detected it decloaks the ship if a macro is detected it warps the decloaked cloaker to a belt if theyre not afk theyll freak out over this and react quickly thus theyre actively playing
nice idea may i suggest instead of tieing it to a pos make it a distructable station service much like the medical but alow it to reach out and tie in with other staions in the constilation also make it vulnerable to a hacking mod loaded with nano virus goo oh it would be nice to include the logistics class of ships in this idea maybe
its interesting but i dont see this as a good idea it makes communications way too complicated and only benefits 00 alliances i say no
good idea
i understand how you want to implement your idea but why why do you want to introduce this  that is in no way clear to me
the local issue is a hot topic it has been debated among players a lot and ccp has also told that it is planning to do something with it there were several topics about local here on csm for example simply removing it or swapping obligatory local to obligatory constellation chat this idea is the best i have seen so far so go go go 1 support it nerfs local which is a good thing but it nerfs it in a way that you can dampen the nerfing effect if you do for it it gives advantage to those who are fighting in their own territory let it be 00 or in empire in the territory of their chosen faction and it favours those who work in teams roaming gangs with recons the only group who is definitely put into disadvantage by this are the solo ninja npcers but thats okay to me some parts of the proposal need refinement it is not obvious how the standingbased access and the payforservice method can coexist and the balancing needs to be done properly but the idea itself is great
thx ill try to answer in short to your concernsblob warfare issue if the network hub module is outside the forcefield and 10ish black ops ships can disable it quickly then the anchorable hub module isnt so overpowered right  ccp will surely balance this if this my proposal gets troughdefenders receive more love with the current sov system you are right its no too complicated getting sov3 the only necessary condition is time yes and you have to defend it too but there are discussions about sov change too i dont think my proposal could get into game before a sov finetune also if there are only 12 hub modules in system its no too complicated to force the defenders to also use recon ships as backup if there are lots of deadstars with hub modules in hte system then defenders deserve their local for their fuel imho this seems balanced to merecon ships yep looks like you missed it there are a few thoughts hereeccmew black ops hacking cloaking i will answer this in my next post because of 358 char left only in this one 
outside the pos modules have been the laughingstock of ccp they promised us with the change of modules outside that small gang pos warfare would be possible i have no faith that ccp can continue with any outside pos module without completely revamping the whole sov mechanic and with the shredder pos around everywhere to protect cyno jammers they would be included in those or made specifically for neural nets black ops are currently in a prenerfed state they cant cyno into a system with a jammer so its a null point to use them specifically against a pos and to basically ask people to use tech two ships against laggy mechanics that fire through them with massive range and the precision of gunners i can not think that any pos module would be anywhere near a good thing in fact if it was a pos module i would think it another kick in the shin to the sov warfare and game in generali really think your system is too unbalanced you propose to give defenders who often have lvl 3 the ability to have what is in effect better than current local in terms of it lets you know who exactly left which is useful in populated systems and you give a ships that are covert operations scouts with basically no combat and reconnaissance ships the ability to give paltry information and do it in a vulnerable state with fuel consumption they cant carry probes plus fuel and be delayed using the magic module to know how many people are in system to know if they should even drop probes what you are in effect doing is slowing down the time it takes a recon to assemble any useful information from when they jump in by a severe amount  jump in get past any camps decloak activate magic module move around to not get scanned wait for results of numbers in system move some more decide whether numbers in system qualify for dropping probes move more drop probes relay information to friendliesany level 3 system will have their ratters and vulnerable assets loooong goneany system with a neural net on a pos surely will have a system scanner as they are cheap and super powerful you are hovering on the edge of time it takes an enemy to scan and warp in on a target before he can get results and to be honest knowing the local count isnt much intel for that riskits tough to propose a system so tied to sov when we clamor for changeccp proposed in a sov change they thought of making a deployable offensive cyno jammer there could be something like that for neural nets i supposei await what you have planned for the hostile forces as you havent had time to explain that yet as you are still forming up your proposal
hacking and eweccw to be honest id skip this in the first version if the 10 version is working without lagging to hell then these could be cool stuffs i could have mention this in the opening post but it seems to me people are already skipping paragraphs with this the description would be epic long and the whole idea would be more complex than id like to keep in mind actually i have some fresh ideas see black ops but i dontt know how would these impact the server side what if it would get extra load because of one ew stuff if it would cause extra lag imagine what if 200 people are starting to hack i would be cursed for a lifetime thats why i picked cheap and safe solutions which should not cause significant surplus load to any nodeblack ops after reading a couple times im more and more sure i should have pay more attention on my english classes i could not figure out the pointabout black ops they also could receive the ability to fit a mobile network hub like the combat recon ships but im afraid this would make them pwnmachines or they could fit scramblers which makes them harder to detect a scrambler module black ops only module could dampen the effectiveness by 1 or just set level 1 of hostile networks affecting the black ops ship onlycloaking cloakers force recon covert ops should receive some tweaking id say they sould receive bonus in cloaked state against detection but im against to boost them more than enable cloaked scanning see the part about recon ships they sould get only one of these regular ships should not receive any kind of bonus in cloaked state than they are cloaked
do cloaked ships show up in local count or any way while cloaked
you got some valid points but as i stated before this is just a plan the whole stuff is adjustable the only important point is the chance of local management i could not spent enough time with everelated stuff lately work summer girls so it seems i could not spend enough time with think this over and over and get a good balance but i dont think this is a big problem the main point is already written in the short description in the opening post if this passes trough ccp will finetune it anywaysif you could suggest a better balance id welcome it if you have more well thought out suggestions i wont be shy to give credit
i think regular ships should show up in cloaked state also just like uncloaked force recon ships covops maybe black ops with ew are a good question id say let them see in local count but you probably wont like this answer  there are pros and cons in this situation and i drunk some beer after work so let me think on the stuffs you mentioned till tomorrow
make a tl dr post i cant quite understand all that has been written in 3 max length replies
i think that recons would become too UFFFDber if they could evade being counted on local just imagine you move into some enemy system with sov34 full of people you hit the cloak in your rapier  arazu and noone notices any hostile presence in system while you are ganking people in belts one thing is sure whenever a ship enters a system there should a notification about it no matter what but as i pointed out above i think they should be accounted for all the time if the nerural network level is high enough
i think the exact details have some problems but the overall idea is a very good one change intel away from being chatbased and towards being intelbased this makes sense on every level i assume that when this change is made local chat will go to being a membershipoptional hiddennames chat channel also just to throw out some different numbers how about this level 1 60 second delay names of friendliesas defined by mutual 0 standings and total numbers only provided by concord to all highsec pilots above 20 sec or provided by a minimal scanning infrastructure1 scanner active level 2 30 second delay names of all pilots provided by factions to all highsec and lowsec pilots in factioncontrolled space above 20 standing or provided by sov 2 and a reasonable scanning infrastructure3 scanners active level 3 no delay all names and what ships everyone is flying provided by scan probeprobably a new variety or provided by sov 3 and a large scanning infrastructure6 scanners active also provided to anyone who has a ship using one of these scan probes as a designated booster in gangor perhaps add a skill for how far the bonus extends level 4 no delay all names and ships and the ability to warp to anyone as if they were in gang provided exclusively by sov 4 and a massive scanning infrastructure10 scanners active a cloaked ship is scanned as though the intel source is 1 level lower level 1 doesnt count them level 2 doesnt name them level 3 doesnt tell you what ship theyre inand still operates under a delay and level 4 doesnt let you warp to them a cloaked ship is still unscannable and it provides a reasonable defence against enemy intelgathering but its a clearly delineated bonus and i feel its of an appropriate size scanners would be relatively large and expensive pos modules or otherwise modules on whatever the most appropriate structure is if 00 infrastructure is changed dramatically also all names provided would be sorted by alliancecorporation a quick glance at show info is automatable imo and you could see the lists with the usual  to expandtype compression itd make searchingespecially in places like jita far easier also of course access to a scanner network could be rented out  i imagine cva would make a pretty penny off that service i think this has a few advantages over the ops proposal for one level 1 and 2 are more clearly distinguished and there are real advantages to running your own scanning infrastructure instead of relying on the npc one only players can hit scanning level 3 and 4 for two cloaking has advantages including the fact that you can never be scanned out but anyone with a scan probe can still find out who you are i also like the cloaks degrade intel 1 level aspect for three its better defined outlining exactly what bonuses are attained from standings modules and sovereignty
its a shame that we are the only people to think this
theres a reason for having a checking account savings account and other accounts in rl it keeps the flow of personal finances much more visibleone account to manage cashflow from money making activitiesone account that is savingsone account that is for planned expendaturesthis makes personal finance 10000000 easier since you can very clearly see your cash flow situationas a parttime trader it would be greatly helpful for me to have a separate wallet for managing my trading funds and what i want to set aside as my working funds id like to be able to watch my market growth without having to remind myself of random purchases to take into accountalso nice to have some separations for dealing with the fact that im generally working with loaned money and building excel spreadsheets to keep track of everything is a painwould furthermore be nice to be able to manage all my clones various markets separately i imagine a lot of people who engage in multiple economic activities in different areas would benefit from more organization to their transactionsan option to switch the primary wallet would be analogous to having a cash card a check book a credit card and cash lets me keep all credits and debits in the right places

this is a terrible terrible idea and would force people to grind longer before they could start enjoying the game all this would do would make it easy for the freeloaders in lowsec to separate the working pilot from his hardearned isk it would increase the amount of time before players could get enough money to sustain themselves and join a lowsec00 corpa rewards decrease for highsec level 4 agents may be ripe but not removing them altogether i only have 2 accounts and level 3s dont pull in the income that i need i dont want to have to start violating the eula just so i can sustain myself in eve while i think its fine as it is id be willing to support a small nerf so that i can have my fun in peace without worrying about some loser scanning out my mission zone killing me and salvaging all my kills while at the same time paying a price for the peace of mind and ability to play how i chooseall play styles including high sec missioning should be sustainable and viable the income ratio shouldnt be quite the same as in 00 but it should still be doable
hisec exploration is a viable profession you can scan out and run hisec sites pretty easily and make a decent profit itll take you awhile to make enough isk for some of the more highticket items recons hacs faction ships etc but its more than enough to sustain yourself i dont see whats wrong with that level of profit for hisec missions it works fine for hisec miningexploration i dont see why missionrunners should be the exception here no one is saying that missions should be nigh useless but right now its over the topjoining a lowsec00 corp doesnt require a ridiculous income for one if youre in a lowsec00 corp you could rat or mission in their territory and earn all the isk you want for two just because you cant afford to easily replace pimped hacs every day doesnt mean that you cant sustain yourself
at an average loss rate of 1 ship  14 hours to getting scanned out and killed not including gatecamps if im going to change systems i wait until just before downtime in lowsec it does require either a high initial income or a reasonable sustained income the only source of anything remotely approaching the ability to replace the loss of my megathorn or my raven every week or so is running l4s in highsecanything less than 15mhour pretty much makes this game unplayable at least for me since id be grinding for weeks to replace a ship lost in a few minutes of fun that isnt my idea of fun in eve being forced to do it in a place where someone can come kill me while im running missions whenever they want doesnt seem like an improvement to me
then why not run missions in lowsec and keep said profit there are plenty of ways to dodge pirates so no you wont be continuously killed if youre paying attentionthe best way is to get some friendscorpmates together and kill any pirates that venture around the area of space youre in eg fight for valuable space besides there is no rule that every time you have to go out you have to be flying a ing battleship if you find that you cant reliably support bs losses why not try cruisersbattlecruisers andor fit t1 mods as opposed to t2
id love to do you have a guide on how i can be outfitted for shield tanking and missile dps and still not get continuously killedyeah we tried that once worked until our first victims friends showed up turns out that people who reap the heightened rewards of lowsec and can afford faction battleships and heavy interdictors generally beat a ferox a caracal an ewar frigate and a raven trying to make their way in go figurei dont have the skills to do what i enjoy doing l4s in a cruiser and i dont have the time or patience or the t2 missile skills required to do them in a battlecruiser my role in the gang is to do dps another person absorbs damage for me at least my role works best in a battleship and i very seldom lose my ship to npc rats i dont have enough isk to regularly fund getting killed by pirates i certainly dont have the isk to throw away cruisers and battlecruisers experimenting with fits that work welland i dont fit t2 mods i cant afford them i fit named t1s except in the case of cap modules on my feroxthe point is eve used to be a sandbox game where you can do anything you want and do it profitably its slowly heading in a more focused you have to do this or youre useless kind of direction with proposed changes like these the nano nerf et ceterareally though i dont see what you really have to complain about you already have l5s exclusive to nullsec and lowsec and you can make a crap ton more doing those than you can running l4s in highsec the lp rewards are greater in lowsec and you get all kinds of extra opportunities like pirate missions narcotics and screwing with fw players if you dont think that lowsec is profitable enough why not try to buff lowsec rather than ruin the game for those of us who are already just barely getting by in highsec
this thread has a lot of good advice i havent lost a ship in lowsec in awhile while i dont run missions i run exploration complexes which are easier to find than missions well i suppose i have lost a ship recently if you count my dumbass forgetting how shooting back at campers stops you from jumping through a gate but that was bad luck and my own stupidity okay you wont win every battle especially if your opponent is more organized than you them flying hictorsbattleships has nothing to do with them living in lowsec sigh1 t2 is cheaper than good named t12 you dont use the same damn ship for pvp that you do for npcing you shouldnt be losing a missionship often if at allbarely getting by running hisec level 4s lol there are people who get by making less than half the profit you do mining somehow they manage i repeat you dont need to be constantly replacing battleships to be effective if you buffed lowsec00 a load then while riskreward would be restored inflation would be ing ridiculous and the expensive stuff thats supposed to be rare and special suddenly wouldnt be so anymore
sit in motsu running missions pretty much risk free is ed
highsec l4 messes up what could have been an interesting market dynamic

just so you know it was raised at the last csm meeting was approved for escalation
this proposal includes a coordinated set of ideas that encompass changes to 00 sov warfare and the roles of supercaps caps and subcaps the idea is that all of these concerns are so tightly related that its easier to try and solve all the problems together than to come up with piecemeal solutions so this is not pickandchoose its allornone here are the problems the solution tries to solvein sov warfare there is only one case where you would prefer to have a pilot in a subcap rather than in a capship and that is a cynojammer takedown seems like people would prefer that subcaps have more purpose in sov warfare that cant be better filled by capsaccording to ccp sov warfare needs a place for small gangs to contribute read a step in sov warfare that cant be totally blobbed and can be done in subcapsthe costbenefit analysis for living in 00 is not favorablesome people want roaming gangs to be able to do some level of infrastructural damage in conquerable space but allowing that makes problem 3 even worseone ship killing 200 other ships by pushing one button is not very funand here are some good things about living in 00 that the proposal tries not to mess upthere are massive fleet battles featuring huge expensive capital and supercapital shipsit takes 1 to effectively wage sov warfarethose who have the best organization of the most dedicated players have the best chance of succeeding in 00onto the changesnew sov warfare system  planetary basesintroduce a new sovholding structure the planetary base pb which is anchored at a planet moonanchored pos no longer contribute to sov each pb is associated with a set of five planetary defense stations pds with are located on different grids one au or so from the pb pbs get the set of anchorable offensive and defensive modules that pos currently get in the live game however cynojammers jump bridges cyno beacons and other noncombat modules can only be anchored at posthe process of destroying a pb is exactly like destroying a pos except that after the pb comes out of reinforced it continues to be invulnerable until repped or until three out of its five pds are incapped once the planetary base is vulnerable it remains so as long as three out of five pds are incapped the pds are designed to be subcap objectives think of them like station services with far far fewer hp 20 bs should be able to take one out in twenty minutes or so however the pds are selfrepairing around 10 minutes after being incapped the length of time is a balance point the pds come back online with full hp consequently teams of subcaps from an attacking fleet need to constantly work to keep the majority of the pds down while the main fleet attacks the pb the hp of the pb should be such that you can finish one off in two fullyutilized windows of opportunity with a fleet that includes 35 or so dreads the hp is a tweakable balancing pointpds can only be targeted during the window of time after a pb exits reinforced and before the pb is repped optional idea while the planetary base is vulnerable the guns at the planetary base dont fire you could dream up other bonuses gained from disabling more than 35 pdsi have put a little faq at the end that explains how this addresses problems 1 and 2 abovepos changes  small gang harassment targetswith pos no longer being sovholding structures they can be made more vulnerable to attacks by roaming gangs that want to attack infrastructure
move all pos facilities moonmining research production storage etc outside of the pos shields the modules can be incapped by roamers to temporarily disable their function but to destroy them an attacker must first destroy the pos control tower when a pos module that contains a resource eg harvested moon mins or reaction products is incapped some percentage of its contents are ejected into space for the harassers to keep the process for destroying a pos should remain the same but reduce the offensive modules anchorable at a pos so as to make the pos modules reasonably vulnerable to harassment read a limited number of small guns along with the normal neuts scrams ecm etcpos keep their current level of shields so theyre still reasonable to use as staging structures during an invasion of a hostile system but see the titan change further down as well the hp of the modules that will now be outside of the pos shields is a balance pointpos changes  reducing the upkeep costincreasing profitabilityassumedly some people will actually go around incapping moonmining modules and so forth which is going to hurt the profitability of living in 00 which is already not so hot to overcompensate reduce the cost of maintaining the network of pos and increase their rates of production decrease the upfront cost of a pos reduce control tower and module base costs and increase the droprates for faction tower and pos module bpcs reduce the rate of pos fuel and trade goods consumption increase silo and fuelbay size to reduce the amount of tedious upkeep effort this is on top of the fact that under the new sov warfare system described above you can probably get by with fewer pos to begin with increase reaction rates and min harvesting rates to overcompensate for the potential loss of resources to raiders because this will affect the global supply of reaction products it will probably be necessary to adjust the amounts of reaction products needed for t2 production in a playerbased economy like eve if youre not increasing profitability by opening up a new market adding a new game mechanic then youre achieving it by wealth transfer the t2 market is the vehicle for transferring wealth from elsewhere into 00how does this help the average joe maybe if your alliance has a lower upkeep cost for maintaining the empire it will reduce your taxes some i mean probably theyll just use the extra isk to buy some jerk a mothership who will then never log in again but the proposal cant be blamed for that titan changes  make them deathstarlike xdin order to keep titans from dominating the defense of the pds we need to get rid of the aoe doomsday the new titan gets two modes of operation one offensive and one defensivein offensive mode the titan is mobile and can use its doomsday device however replace the aoe effect with a very powerful singletarget damage effect sufficient to alpha any one capital ship the exact damage is a tweakable balance pointin defensive mode the titan is completely immobile but projects its shields outward as a poscaliber forcefield and can use its jump bridge and when i say completely immobile i mean unbumpable but also unable to engage jump drives when in defensive mode the titans shield capacity is multiplied up to about the level of a large pos the exact hp is a tweakable balance point a titan can act as a staging point for an invasion in a pinch although obviously you cant it into a cynojammed system and it wont go into reinforced when it gets into armor it just dies really quicklythe titan can switch modes on a longish cooldown balance pointcreditsthis proposal is the result of fahtim meidiress thread several people contributed to it and i wasnt the main one
minifaqobvious objectionsobjection this does nothing about the capitals online problem people will just use capitals for taking down the moonbased planetary defense stations in addition to using them to take down the planetary basethe pds only stay down for around 10 minutes think about how long it takes you to warp slowaligning caps around in a laggy fleet fight if you try to blob your caps around you will never get your caps back into position at the planetary base to do damage to it during its window of vulnerability after taking down the pdss your dreads need to be sitting there ready to go into siege when they get their window of opportunity if you foolishly split your caps up among the pds your several small groups of caps might get individually blobbed and destroyed by the defenderobjection people are just going to blob all the planetary defense modules noone will spread outif you take that approach youre going to waste a lot of your dreadss siege cycles and make the process take longer overallyou need to knock out 3 out of 5 pdss to make the planetary base vulnerable when incapacitated the pds stays down for about 10 minutes  about one siege cycle if you split your forces and coordinate so that they all go down at about the same time you can get about one full siege cycle of damage in if your blob takes them down one at a time and it takes 4 minutes for each one then by the time youve taken down 3 1 is going to come online in two minutes or so enjoy your two minutes of siege damage before the base goes invulnerable againobjection well the defender will just blob up and kill the smaller gangs that are attacking the planetary defense modulesyou can keep dodging their blob and hitting the pdss where there blob isnt in high lag it will take them quite a while to warp their blob from pds to pds load grid and start killing your pdskillers who are already on grid and killing a pds meanwhile all your other subcap groups are at other pdss bringing them downalternatively bubble them when they warp in blob up yourself and enjoy your huge badass fleet fight at least if they choose to blob your pdskillers youll be fighting them at a pds instead of a deathstar or lagstar pos the point of the idea isnt to completely eliminate blob warfare in all cases it wouldnt really help with lag much anyway because as soon as you get 400 guys in a single system it goes to  regardless of what grid youre onbut if youre talking about a fleet blob situation dont pretend that a blob of ships can flit all around a laggedout system on a whim smashing groups of subcaps maybe one group every 20 minutes if the node doesnt crash meanwhile the planetary base is vulnerable to sieged dreads and is getting its ass kicked
this trivializes sov warfare and lets any small gang chip away the sov of a thousandsstrong empireno it doesnt this new sov warfare system is more immune to small gang harassment than the current system isunder the current system if you find a small pos with no guns you could theoretically park a capstable geddon there all night and fire at with t1 ammo and blow it up if no one came to stop you under this new system you must have a fleet to take down the sovholding structures the planetary bases which are the sovholding structures are invulnerable to attack unless the majority of their satellite defensive modules have been incapacitated those satellite modules are selfrepairing on a pretty short timer any small gang that tries to take down a planetary base is going to be stuck playing whackamole with the defensive modules and never be able to hurt the planetary basewhat the new system allows is a role for small gangs of subcapitals to split off from the main fleet and pursue subcapital sov objectives in support of the activity of the main fleet without the rest of the fleet in system the small gang is useless without the small gangs the main fleet the cap fleet is useless everyone is working together in the same system at the same time
a great consensus plan i know the csm has seen a few 00 related topics come their way but this one was really hashed out from the ground up in fahtims thread
the only part of this i disagree with is the proposed ddd changes ideas like the ones in yaays thread accomplish the same objectives better while being more interesting and useful aside from that however i like this proposal im still amazed by its genesis but the results look like a plan that has a good chance of not ing off anybody too much which is saying quite a lot
yeh i liked some of xttzs ideas from that thread really any change to the titan that prevents a defender using aoe dd to oneclickkill the subcap teams at the pds would work i kind of like the mobile base idea for the titan in our proposal because currently its a real pita breaking into a fullytowered system no free moon for a staging pos but its not like a critical element of the proposal the critical element is that the subcapkilling aoe dd goes away but it remains useful to bring a titan onto the battlefield
oh i liked the idea about defensive mode should be a module rather than a big switch but the principle of a mobile humongous shield is a good one the current titan setup of cloakdddistabs is bad but theres a lot of proposed ddd changes out there that would make it just fine ultimately i want them to have a role in combat that lasts longer than 20 seconds that allows the titan a goodthough not perfect chance of survival and that doesnt wreck fleets singlehandedly i dont much care what that role is
so far the threads already a model of how to get a good proposal going take the topic to the speakers corner deliberate the points and gather concerns from multiple parties after everyones hopefully smarter about all the interests and consequences involved with the change several drafts are produced discussed and finally somebody takes it to assemblythis proposal is a result of the hard work of more than several people who dont always fully agree on the subjects at hand at times there have been some funkier twists considered but only the ones that made it through deliberation have made it here there still might be work going onextended creditssovereignty decentralization  nande edit support

i dont want an answer because i know the answer it was stated when they introduced invention no new bpos the bpos that are in game will remainto ask for an answer again is asking for them to either revisit that decision or repeat themselves i dont think either is necessary let the whiners whine

yes take a look at sentry guns please if pirates had to scan people out instead of ing each other off all day at a gate camp you might actually get more people into low sec
hii submitted a petition for this and was advised to raise it on the council to get support for a change in the game mechanics please add your supportin my opinion the wrong price is being used where a buy order is placed at a higher price than items already being sold on the market in this case it uses the higher buy price rather than the asking price for the goodsthis is critical and has happened to me twice now whereby when entering a buy order you catch an extra key just as you press enter and instead of bidding 5 million isk you end up bidding 50 million even though items are being sold at 10 million and only 10 million is required to buy the item it gives the seller the whole 50 million whilst this is a very nice surprise for the seller it is pretty ridiculous and would never happen in real life ps the are you sure you want to buy for this price dialogue box didnt appear in the instance above due to the lower intended bid price vs the higher market averageit took me quite a while to gather the 50 million and im pretty annoyed at having given it away when i didnt intendneed tocan we get this changed so that it only pays the seller the asking price pleasealso the are you sure dialogue box appears with annoying regularity when you dont want it but fails to appear when you do and i guess that the reason for this is it always compares the price to regional average i think it would be a much more useful tool if it were to compare your new buy order to other buy orders already on the market and your new sell order to other sell orders on the market
agree with changing how it works yes i dont like punishing people too harshly for typosespecially given that i make so many
makes sense
having wasted 200 mil doing something similar quite sometime ago i agreehowever bear in mind that some players dont look at sell orders when they put buys up but you are rightif your buy order is higher per unit than the current sell order you should get a warning boxthe box should always appear but have an option to never show againthen typos can be directly attributed to stupidity take carearithron
you mean like the warning box that pops up when ever you buy something for a price far greater than the regional average like how the op bought something for 10x the likely regional average i expect that the reason that this works this way is that the buy order price can be used for all the purchases it generates without checking the prices of the seller orders that it fills individually to calculate the amount of isk to transfer it only needs to check for sell orders at a lower price and then fill the sell orders starting with the lowest priced offer thus allowing the market to place a minimal load on the server
a carrier undocks from a station deploys a damn armada of dronesfighters ganks freely while the attackers futilely try to get to him through the docking ring recalls his armada  docks while laughingyes station hugging is bugged all to hellthe invulnerability timer needs to be based on the grid load the higher the grid load the longer a ship is untouchable and thus remains within docking range once the ship takes any action other than dock its fair game for 60 seconds unless it initiates aggression and then its stuck for lets say025 seconds multiplied by the signature radius of the ship thus a frigate can dock pretty quickly while a bs has nearly 100 seconds to sit there and tank and then theres the sig radius of a capital ship change their multiple to 05 secondssigthis is ofc after the target ship initiates aggression if they dont aggro they can sit there and dock at their liesure regardless of their size even if you bump them 200km they still have the dock option

this is really a great idea it returns the mwd back to its intended original use getting in and out of combat quickly
i looked through the minutes of the last meeting and didnt see any disscussion on nonpvp related areas unless they were general areas like the ui nothing about mining or tradegood trading or other high sec concernsare there any carebears on the council or did the pvpers take over the council too
a lot of those concerns were addressed in the csms first trip to iceland
are there minutes to that meeting
yes there has been plentyyesterday we discussed some issues in regards to missions at iceland we discussed assembly arrays stock markets shares market and things like that
yes see the csm section in eve insiderand i suppose im the big evil carebear on the council or so they say i brought up mission improvements yesterday and lavista vista is working on a complex plan to improve industryif you have any ideas you would like to see addressed please speak up
rumour has it that you compromised on your i would never shoot anyone even in self defence stance
everything in eve is pvp related one way or another
actually from what i heard she just tackled still quite an improvement all told
even worse she forced someone to pvp against their willoh ankh you are a now
simple all offlined poss will unanchor themselves if not onlined after 3 days 1 full day of onlining resets the timer reason towers need to be tended to they shouldnt be allowed to sit there and force someone to blow them up just because someone was too lazy to remove them or used as place holders for moonsi like 3 days but 5 days is fine with me toowhatcha think
just tie it in with all the other space trash and make it a 30 day timerotherwise im all for such an idea
disagreea pos is a player or corporations stuff even if that person anchors a pos quits eve then lets it sit there you still have to fight that person to claim what they have laid stake to
i have a problem with needing to fight someone who quitbut i agree somewhat with siigariso i propose simply that if the pos if offline you receive no messages that its being attacked or destroyed as the communications array would logically be offline as well in that manner it still acts as a buffer to a zone of space but if the space is neglected it can be taken without notice
while i do not support automatic unanchoring i would rather see like a new speciality skill  eg unanchoring like hacking that an offlined tower after a certain amount of time eg 30 days will be accessible for pilots with the unanchroing skillyou can try and unanchor it like you would try and open hacking sites either either a successfull unachor or fail  thus try again if success you can simply scoop the tower wed then see professional tower hunters as a playstyle as well
while i am not supportin unanchoring especially within the short time frame in the op i am supporting the automated cleanup of posesthey should however not just disappear or get unanchored but instead get taken over by the local pirate faction or drones and need to be destroyed and cleaned out first before a new pos can be placed in
30 days poof
i think 30 days is too long needs to be relevent to the whole concept of corpsalliances managing controllable ammounts of space and in wartime why should someones unguarded asset sit there with no repercussions the only mechanic is the anchoring this change would make people think about their assets remove the ability to put place holders down on moons and govern their space in a more effective fashionthere should be no reason why if someone else wanted the moon that the current tenenat can provide excess boredom to other players by simply leaving it therei do support a hacking skill as well very nice mechanic ideai think 5 days is fine after the tower goes offline these types changes support better sov mechanics all around in 00 and are small steps to limit boredom while promiting sov holders to tend to their space better and not cause undew aggravation for others
just limit missions 110true sec  10day 05 system  1105 6 missions 6 missions  40min each  4 hours farmers are dead normal players not effected
i think it would be a good idea for squadwingfleet commanders to have different colored texts than the rest of the fleet this would prevent confusion and would eliminate orders being delivered like this all caps sucks it makes my eyes hurt and it looks ededit apparently mentally challenged personed is a profane word
give the fcor channel mod generally the option of designating somebody as typing in a given colour  something like color blue herschel yamamoto for example there might be some optimization needed  say give you the option of automatically setting your own color when youre channel mod  but this would be a good plan
agree fc should be in pink
gold wing red wing green wing all very interesting concepts however that would mean for claritys sake that some of the color functions we have now need to have new icons to avoid confusion
i agree
our even a brighter bolder white for fcwcsc and as an assignable rolei will miss my caps though
genius
i will support the idea but i think this is impossible
nothing is imposeble this can be made actualy the system will be static only entrance in it gate will not it will respawn just like acceleration gatesi like idea and i always wanted to see that future in eve what defenetly do something with explorationnote just think about drone regions before and jove space it is there but we cant enter yet hope someday we can there is also gms system cant remeber the name atm its also listed on map but you cant get in because there is no static gates for entrance
yesthis is cooli like it
or a wormhole back to old earth where we can attack and conquer the corrupt and decadent society which abandoned us
badly needed addition im all for it

whenever i go to the insurance button i get hit by such mails for corp insured ships personally i feel that this is an issue that needs fixing somehow maybe a check every time a ship is made an active ship be it logon or activating in a stationboarding the ship at that point a check is made and if need be the advise mail sent rather then waiting till it is destroyed or the insurance button clicked as for corp insured  mail the person who is activating the ship but also provide a tab in the corp panel that the apropriate people can see the status of all corp insurance contracts on both existing and recently expired
thanks guys there has to be more people who have experienced this other than the rantings of my corpmates
the current system is quite simply brokenfundementaly flawedshippers have effectivly no faith in the system as it currently stands so it is not effectivly used by the general player base only by major corperations for internal deliveries or by gankers atempting to lure prey to low sec for easy hauler kills the few people that do try to use it tack on huge bond requirements 99 of these are bond pirates that wait for a hauler to attempt delivery and then gank the defenceless hauler not only gaining a easy kill the loot but also the exhorbatant bounty yet another reason this system is brokenwhat you need to do is take the shiped items out of the equaisiona shipper purchases either boxes based on sizedistancesecurity and handling instructionsrush or time critical ect or a bulk shipping contract calculated on a per 3m basisthe hauler picks up packages only limited by his cargo bay size he has no access to the boxes content but will be payed a fee upon delivery to the destonationif for some reason the hauler fails to deliver the goods logged out cancel subscription blown up in deep space after a certain time the boxes would return to the origin for another hauler to transport it is also possible for the hauler to be blown up or robbed and the thief to deliver the boxes for the shipping feeas for the bulk shipments all the haulers get is a token of the goods to be hauled not the actual material but the method uses a single 3m parcel amount allowing any number of players to participate in transporting the bulk cargo from frigates with 5 cargo to haulers with 20k30k cargoas for the hauler he would goto a database and search for shipments based on things like destonization distancejumps or security risk for instance a hauler could look for shipments less than 300 3m 5 jumps or less and only high sec and from this list he can select the parcels he will attempt to haul at the destonation he simply goes in and completes the hauling contract and gets paid the standard shipping fee as far as the shipper is concerned its irrelevant if its 30isk of trit or a multi million isk blueprintthis could be a very entertaining content for haulers and traders if it were fixed but in its current form the game is far too limited to implement the real security required for a realistic transport for goods unless you gonna have a way to directly penalize thiefs blow up the pirate ship or ban the player for a week if cought my method is infinatly more practicle and functional you could easily place restrictions to thic kind of service that it is more vulnerable in certain areas or unavailable on othersi for one would much prefer to haul goods for other players than just npc goods but im not gonna pay 50 million isk bond to haul 10000 trit around
you know the beautiful thing about public contracts you dont have to accept them if you think the collateral is too high or the pay is too low dont take it just because people are idiots sometimes does not mean that the system is broken
make courier packages unscannable and it might get used more what business is it of yours what i want moved break the seal and find out or stay clueless
what business is it of yours if i give it a quick xray en route set the collateral high enough or stay itemless
it should be my prerogative to place sensors in the package that voids the contract upon scanning and up to the courier ship to protect his ship against said scanning to avoid losing the collateral right now the courier system is quite useless
given that ship scanning doesnt even cause an aggression timer i really fail to see why it should be able to invalidate billions worth of collateral if youre worried about contracts set up as collateral scams changing collateral collection from requiring enough firepower to kill the ship to requiring an interceptor with a ship scanner seems like a really bad way to prevent scams they dont even have to entice you into lowsec or suicide gank you they just have to sit outside station and target you and then they collect their collateral im all in favour of risk and reward action and consequence but this is just ridiculous
how do you figureset a collateral amount that covers your loses isnt that the point of having collateralor do you simply want to use it as a counter measure to cargo scanninga little over powered dont you think pay 10000 isk and nobody can scan your cargo
this idea is completely impracticalthis would void the risk of shipping anything through lownull sec spacewant to ship something along a dangerous route simply create a courier contract to yourself then keep retrying it in an expendable t1 ship until you succeedthere is no risk because if you fail the item respawns back where you started
this is completly untrue the system works perfectly and is being actively used by many players just ask professional hauler corps how many courier jobs they do every day i personally make tens of courier contracts every month all of them are delivered in few hours without any problemsthere is only change courier contracts really need  remove 120k m3 limitas for the lowsec why do you accept lowsec00 couriers if you cant make them you can review the route before you accept courier contract so where is the problem
itd have to be way over the value of the cargo or else itd not make up for the inconvenience of not having it arrive at the destination time being money at those levels all of a sudden not many people want to do the haulingif i didnt have to take out the value of the cargo in collateral but rather could mask the value of the load and generate more work for the would be couriers id think thatd be good for the trade for all parties me the courier and the possible pirate with more targets floating aroundof course id send decoy packages ever so often to discourage theft of the motherloadi never said that the price for creating the actual courier mission or in fact the ability to do so should remain the same just that i think unscanable cans for courier missions would improve the trade
so what should be the price for making your cargo completely unscannable
a percentage of the value of the cargo with this only the contractor actually knows the real value of the haul as the cost of setting one up is in no way related to the payout or collateral but there to prevent massive abuse of the mechanics
how do you calculate the value of the cargo aside of the value assigned by the collateral required by the shipper
just like anything being put up on contracts with the baseprice i guess but id be in favor or at least a 110m flat fee minimum for obscuring the cargo if you dont want to pay that much you can always run the goods in the open like they are now
you realise that for any goods worth hiding the base price has no reflection at all on the actual valuefor example the base price for a complete set all 6 slots of highgrade pirate implants is 48 million isk that right million with an m not a bwhile t2 goods are not quite so bad they are still often an order of magnatude higher than the base pricethe only thing the base price is any good for is estimating the value of minerals and t1 crap
ive seen proposals in the past for camouflage cans  cans that can be displayed to look like they contain a different manifest than they actually do theyd be expensive and reduce your cargo but they would exist would these satisfy your desires
so paying 48m to courier an implant set isnt better than paying 10k isk doing the same if you suspect the load to be worth it take the gamble why would i want to take a similar gamble hauling the set out in the open again
yes but right now people can see that you are carrying an implant setpaying 48m to put your implant set into a box so that nobody can scan them is a bargin aside from the fact that if you bothered to put it in a box then you must have a reason for itthe problem is finding balancing point where it is worthwhile to hide a variety of items without making it standard practice to hide everything cargo scanners already have limited enough application they arent a target for the nerf bat
because if youre competent its not a gamble so lets say youre a pirate you go to forge lowsec buy up a snake set for 15 billion and have it couriered to you with a collateral of 2 billion somebody shoots the ballsy man in the covops you shrug buy another set set another contract and pocket the halfbillion the only gamble is in whether you get free bonus profit or not if its worth couriering its worth getting free money for and couriering again
i currently have an issue with my corporation about office rent mails and lost assetsnow the issue here is it seems my whole corporation is bugged as i have lost assets 2 times now i as the ceo dont get mails about paying rent for the office but my friend who is a director did he told me later 2 incidents so far1 ok last month i the ceo didnt get any mail at all whatsoever and the friend of mine didnt pay the rent as he was expecting me too ofcourse so we both logged on delivered our researched bpos and what we have no officewe got our stuff impounded so i rerented the office but our delivered bpos are gone i petition and 56 days later the bpos are returned to my personal hangar peace but why didnt i as the ceo get a mail about office rent no reply at all on my petition on that it simply got closed2 ok yesterday this time my frienddirector didnt get a mail he delivered hes bpos and what the office is impounded he pays the fee gets all the bpos rerents puts everything where it is suppose to be i logged on now with the rerented office whenever he or i deliver a bpo from researchcopying it disappears even thou we have an officemight i add this time i did infact get a mail so when i woke up and read the mail i got it 6 hours ago and i hear whats going on wtfso now i am stuck with filing another petition too ccp and i have to wait nearly a week to get anything done and as for all of my crucial bpos i will get delivered they wont do  as i have to petition those aswellnow this is a serious issue and really is it my corp that can have some sort of bug and do i need to remake it or whats going on can this be resolvedalso that ccp refuses to respond to me and simply closes my petitions are screwed up since i did add i dont get mails at allin time to pay the rent if that would happen i wouldnt have any problems wouldnt need to file petitions or make stupid threads like thisnot sure if this is the right forum part but yeah
office rent should automatically come from the corporations master wallet with a mail to notify that it was due was paid automatically and how muchif the office has not been accessed in 90 days the rent suspends the assets go to impound and all jobs qued from that office are haltedobviously if no one has accessed the office in 90 days any pos in that system are already offlinegone why bring fuel from another system if your office is in this one ofc jobs running in a local pos couldve been initiated at the pos or from the local office satisfying access reqsthere should be a limit to 1 office per system rather than per station
there is always isk in the master wallet more then enough to pay for this office for several years aheadwell the corporate hangar is used like every single day and were both activeyeah we did this but the issue is the office disappears for some reason we rerent and when we delived our jobs from the former office in the same station we dont get it for some reasonyeah perhaps but were only using 1 office in that systemaccording to what you just written up here something seems to be seriously wrong with my corporation or something  
please contact a senior gm i have had this happen to me before which the gm fixed for me
thanks how do i actually contact a senior gm not to be an ass but through petitions i wont get any replies anyways except returned items and a closed petition where i just have to wait for the next month for this too happen again so if theres a way to contact a gm and have a ingame chat or even a mail contact that would be awesome
well there is a petition type called senior gm i believe but you should file a bug report with all the relevant information and include the bug report id into the petition that will help ccp work out what is wrong
when i was running a research corp we had lost bpos almost once a week they were never the cheap ones either the only things that were lost were a chimera bpo drake bpo and ferox bpo in fact the chimera was missing several times there is a bug with remote placing of research jobs that seems to only be fixed when a gm flushes your research buffer and dumps it back into your hangar
why would a carebear ever want to expose themselves to elite template pvpers drooling to blow up someones unarmed hauler or miner in low sec space or even a novice or casual player wanting to try a bit of pvp low sec by definition forces carebears into high secsome possible fixes 1make a nonpvp faction that has access to many areas via trade routes similar to branches on a tree this would allow deeper access for players and goods and supplies make it possible for escourts to activly defend other ships currently even a titan cant defend a hauler from attack because the attacker can directly attack the hauler and kill it in 12 shots and jump away even with 10 ships defending its still futile there should be some way for these escourts to protect the hauler either by activly shielding the hauler or by making the hauler invulnerable difficult to kill while being escourtedhave a durability bonus added to to novice players so they dont get blown up so fast by ships 200 km away they dont live long enough to have any funhave security zones that you cannot completely destroy ships only severly damage them or that to destroy them takes a large amount of kill damage and includes a faction penalty this would allow novice players to get their feet wet without the unacceptable risk of total annialization before they even know if they want to pvp at higher riskccps all or nothing pvp causes a sharp rift between high sec players and low sec pvpers with no middle ground
so what youre saying is that pvp is too hard and you want ccp to nerf it have you ever actually tried or do you just caricature everybody not in highsec as ravenous and untouchable you dont have the slightest clue of how pvp works and yet youre running in blind terror from it seriously you need to accept that eve does not coat you in bubble wrap and go out and learn to play properly either that or go back to a game that doesnt punish you for your mistakes say pong
wow you reall dont have a grasp on the problem do youthe risk in low sec is too high it doesnt matter if you move everything to low sec except veld mininguntill you lower the risk its empire or cancel accountsas a minerhauler i simply cant afford to get a ship blown up every day just because some pvper wants an easy kill i play for the relaxation and having to watch my ass every second is not how i wish to spend my time or moneythere will be a mass exidus as soon as there is a game similar to eve that is player friendlyeve currently has a bad reputation as a pvp nitch game thats why its still not popular by mmo standards
the first law of economics is incentives matter right now the incentives are to stay out of lowsec if possible  the risk is high and the reward sucks the only people who reside there are pirates and occasionally others visit whether for reasons of doing some business or because they screwed up their autopilot settings if you change those incentives then you will also change the results if say lowsec ore were dramatically buffed then a lot of risktolerant miners would stop laughing at lowsec and go out there factional warfare is a great example of this  you have over 20000 people who have decided to at least visit lowsec once in a while because they like territory control and leaderboards while not wanting to live the hard 00 life you make the fundamental error of assuming that because you are completely intolerant of risk that everyone else is too you are clearly not the marginal case here the point is not to change the reward structure to the point where everybody uses lowsec its to change it so that more people use it for that to happen they dont need to get you out there they just need to get some people out there  like say me im wealthy not particularly riskaverse and willing to try new things but at the same time im not so risk loving that im willing to impoverish myself for a lot of scanning and a bit of adrenalinelike some of my pirate friends are right now the only thing i use lowsec for is the odd bit of piracy when bored and a place to research bpos with less waiting now that i can use a covops cloak if missions were twice as good there as in highsec though id get together a gang of friends to go run them on a regular basis id do the same after an ore improvement if i was a miner even if you never touch lowsec with a 10jump pole itd still move up in population if it got better as for your commentary on eve in general i really have to disagree a game that is like eve but player friendly in the way you mean is not like eve at all its just got a bad codebase and a complex crafting system the whole point of eve is scamming your fellow man shattering player empires and otherwise playing a game that features actual risk and also i have one question for you  if this is such a bad game aimed at a niche you seem to find reprehensible why do you play that isnt gb2wow im curious clearly it does something right or else you wouldnt be here but you dont seem to acknowledge that said something exists
so what youre saying is that pvp is too hard and you want ccp to nerf it have you ever actually tried or do you just caricature everybody not in highsec as ravenous and untouchable you dont have the slightest clue of how pvp works and yet youre running in blind terror from it seriously you need to accept that eve does not coat you in bubble wrap and go out and learn to play properly either that or go back to a game that doesnt punish you for your mistakes say pongim saying the current pvp directly cripples eve as few people like that kind of extreem just go read other games like star trek online its packed with postings about how eves pvp is crippling the games growth and appeal the pvpers are directly forcing nonpvpers either into empire or out of the gameand if this trend continues eve will be another ghost town of nothing but pvpers especially once other eve like games that are player friendly hit the market in the next year or twoi think ccp should really take off the blinders and quit catering to the pvpers that have forced most of the nonpvpers to leave thus giving ccp a false impresson of the possible player base not everyone that wants to play eve enjoys getting ganked or even wants to participate in pvp and trying to force them is counter productive there is a reason eve doesnt even have a million players and most of it is the free for all pvp mindseti want to play eve without some asswhipe harrassing me and ruining my enjoyment of eve and right now the best place to do that is in high sec space most likely in a npc corp because nonpvp player corps can still be wardec and harassed again ruining my enjoyment of eveive tried low sec and even 00 and it wasnt even worth it a little bit total fustration major loss of ships i even traveled 35 jumps to a battle area and died in mere seconds upon entering the system by a ship over 20x my range away and far before i had a chance to have any fun making it pointless to continue doing an activity that was so stupidim basicly a farmer i dont have 12 million points into razor sharp combat skills so im nothing more than a meat target only an idiot would throw away perfectly good ships and isk for someone else to have fun i might as well just delete them in the hanger and save myself the time and fustrationif they had a npnpvp server id move there so fast it would crash the servers
few people like that extreme but then few people play eve by the standards of mmos we have our crowd and were fine with that i think theres a much bigger market out there for games that feel like your actions matter than you do and i think eves longstanding gain in subscribers backs me up on that but youre free to differ that said you certainly cant deny that a large portion of the eve player base likes the free for all pvp setting and that to remove that setting would drive away a vast number of the existing players what mmos are at a million iirc its just wow and a couple asian ones not hitting a million is not a mark of shame also im sure ccp has data on account expiries and if theyre losing 90 of people i think they can look into why but then i dont think theyre losing all that many people even the pathological carebears have a refuge that isnt especially dangerous and they can go about their bearish ways without being forced out by undesired pvp so you want to play eve but only if its the platonic ideal of eve that exists in your head scrub check out the skills and shipsmodules forums learn how to put together a pvp ship join a corp that lets you fight in gang instead of solo and dont fly what you cant afford to lose i wasnt kidding when i said learn to play  you actually need to learn how to play this game if you want to pvp worth a damn who needs 12 million sp in combat to compete check out my old buddy ren tales post on noob pvp for an idea of how to do it just fine without needing huge numbers of sp its slightly dated due to the nos nerf but its still mostly applicable also they do have a nonpvp server its called singularity
make casinos a low and nosec option only also bring back the black market and make low sec stations the only place where you can market anything not massproduced that should bring people down there
im a carebear one of the few still subscribing to eve it is very fustrating to work missions when your are forced to take a big standing hit when the misson is located in low sec space one of the reasons i hate eve missons besides they are a boring grindit is far too risky to go into low sec space because of all the gankers so i never go there ever so it would end alot of annoyance and fustration if you would add filters to mission givers and buy and sell planets either place a collumn in the buysell noting the security of the planet or at least make low security planets red if i could id filter low sec out of all aspects of my game expirenceand you wonder why everyone crowds into high sec
you get one mission rejection every 4 hours if that isnt enough for you find an agent farther from lowsec as for market orders you can already filter out lowsec go to the settings tab on your market page uncheck the lowsec box id like to see the same option for the science and industry page but it exists for the market
it would be nice if drone skills applied to all dronescurrently it seems to me that only combat drones are affeced my mining drones are no faster than default and im sure they dont have any more armor either
itd be nice if there was some skill to increase the efficiency of combat utility drones at the moment they suck quite a lot and have no means of improvement other than ccp boosting them directly quite similar with electronic warfare drones
like that idea
hm we had people leavejoin corps quite a bit in one of our wars when someone did it repetedly a petition apparently was successfulstill highly annoying
should be fixed but at the same time as corp hopping in general is fixed
i support this ideabut as a concord deputy you should operate under the same rules as ai concord obviously then you couldnt operate in 04 and lower gates into those systems would deny you access as previously posted you should have a high standing with your races npcs and high sec status you should automatically be aggroed to any player breaking concord rules as long as you are a concord deputy ab
as discussed in this dev blog system security status and security standing should be more intrinsically linked heres a proposal that should make all of the computations a little easierchange system security standings slightly and base standings loss upon these numbers a simple multiple of system security vs criminal violationinstead of 10 09 ect ect start at 10 how simple is thatthus ganking a ship in sec 10 gets you 10x the security standing loss 002  10 for attacking a shipthis would make displaying the systems true security a lot easier to display as well9348 572 1911 on down to 10ofc once the sec reaches 0000 you no longer take any standings loss for attacking nonwts
so youre proposing to multiply security statuses by 10 display them to four significant digits and massively increase sec loss in general the first two are pointless and the last one is stupid plus it doesnt even work  podkilling someone for 12 in 10or rather 10000 would result in a 120 decline to your sec status ive heard of 10 pirates but 13 pirates are just silly
currently a small pos can go into reinforced mode for nearly 5 daysa medium tower 1d17ha large only 24 hours or lessnow a small tower has relatively few anchored items to keep safe and few guns to onlinereload why nearly a week of reinforced modethe reinforced time needs to be inverted giving large pos and their extensive arrays a longer period to withstand continued assaultorall towers should have the same reinforce timer adjust stront bays to hold say 2 days of fuel for all pos sizes faction pos towers getting a larger stront bay
prefer the second optiongiven that every other aspect of the towers is pure 124 linear scaling but yes
quite simple realy can we please have the two files involved in making the create alchemy progam work with eve unblacklisted from the bin directorythis will allow is creative  vista users to get hardward sound backthankscj
i have to agree with the goon first time ever
t2 bpos are fine and available to everyonejust buy one
t2 bpos are fine they dont influence the market on popular items they do provide the holder with a structural advantage that guarantees them a profit unless everyone else is selling at a substantial lossif you look at the prices charged for the more popular ones they are being valued fairly irrationally they assume that these items will continue to be popular for many years into the future if ccp ever introduces t3 items or something else happens in game a few years from now that makes these items less popular the people buying the bpos today are going to get burned and will most likely never recoup their investment its not too hard to argue that investing 60 billion in a bpo versus using that same 60 billion as working capital and building based on invention is pretty foolishso let the fools have that rare stamp in their stamp collection if thats what makes them happy its no skin off your nose
it would be easier for you to go play another game rather than to change the fundamentals of eves designthat is not a little quip either according to your post you simply do not like eve logging into eve is consent to pvp

just going to get a stub up here for helping to organize the discussions for changes to sovgeneral discussion thread that this should be a fork off of linkagemy proposal outline in progress threadonce we go with the planet based sov system theres a great question of what to do with possmain concern is that once sov is won there should be a mechanic for clearing out all the old poss who have no right to exist near that planetpropose space laser for lasing said nimby poss into the debris belt construction of planetary defense platform results in reinforcement of all poss who are at bad standings with alliance if theyre not taken down while reinforced they get popped no money back its a defense platform so it makes sense that it blows things up other concern is for losec people not really sure how it affects them since im not a losec guy losec to me is where to find war targets U304BU306Ashould losec have the same system of sov and should it involve fanciful new poss or what
people will presumably not keep useless poses fueled and as such theyll offline make it so that offlined poses like any other piece of anchored debris disappear after 30 days no need for odd solutions like pospopping lasers
issue im getting at is the poss that are occupying valuable moons should i be fighting over a space at a moon in the old pos system instead of my hard fought for and potentially easier to defend the planet do we still want to see moon fights after the sov changesas for the other towers yeah with no other purpose theyre not going to become an issue
general discussion thread that this should be a fork off of linkagemy proposal outline in progress threadthreading this as not to clog up our main discussionsregarding a boost to 00 income more meaningful 00 sov and more warfare granularity ive come up with a cool rough conceptplanetary production platformmodular hardware that is the basis of civilization in 00 can be quickly fielded uses produced materials to finish selfconstruction and repair and is 00 owner friendly in its defensive behaviorcan be configured at a planet where sov is owned deployed and configured either for gas production gas giant planets or ore production rocky planetsposesque guns to deter the random mauler with t1 crystalsrolling reinforcement systemevery successful attack starts an operationally reinforced timer and reduces production by a small amount and starts burning a tiny amount of strontwhen the timer goes down the platform will attempt to repair incapacitated parts of itself it temporarily lifts the reinforced shield to allow this to process to happenanother successful attack requires more hp activates another timer increases fuel consumption and decreased production rough proposalsproduction goes down in a 95 85 75 50 25 death patternfuel consumption becomes a little troublesome after the 75 levelhp is double for each phase and takes about 40m for final platform deaththis is much like the pos system of brokered fights timer based but a lot more granular times should be made as not to cause too much of a pain i had considered eight or twelve hour set timers to make the process straightforward theory is the first two attacks are kind of meaningless after that the defender starts needing to respond or face some stiff income lossproduced materials are a either a special gas mixture or special ore mixturemore diverse than materials obtained from moons since planets are of slightly more even compositionrequires moon materials and a free reactor to extract the ores subcomponents into our familiar moon goop and asteroid ores  you use moon material to extract different moon material and some minerals this will help balance regions with bad or horrible moons with regions where money mints are more commonincrease in general 00 wealth through the nice increases in production that planets would afford provides a granular target of 00 warfare that can be made pvp by defenders or economic for attackers increase in 00 alliance independence from empireim proposing that these structures can only be built in 00 to further differentiate empire 00 from real deal 00 time to give the 00 alliances a boost with the better tools of sov and the granularity of exposure theres already going to be more access to 00 and more vulnerability to the losec vagrantsi know ccp intended for moon compositions to stimulate trade blah blah blah but it didnt work out that way and this is one thing that could potentially provide some early balance to a final solution if there is one 00 alliances should really be more independent in my opinion let losec have to go hunting for other components 00 empires are civilizations that stand on their own
back to the independent 00 empires thing forgot to stuff in the idea of possibly being able to produce some npc pos fuel robotics parts etc seriously who wants to travel to hisec to fuel a pos when they could be pewpewing fun fun
very last link in jades post above yours sadly there are no minutes for most meetings so chatlogs are what we get
lol bane got voted down again 3rd strike and out who can be more ineffective than that guy jade has better chance off changing 00 than he has of changing cap ships
im rather amazed by that vote on the forum changes for one you can submit your 2nd and 3rd batches of issues at any point you desire its not a matter of missing the deadline because there is no deadline you just submit your list and get responses back in 2 weeks of course that changes if ccp is screwing around with the founding document somehow but from what i know missing the deadline is a bogus concern furthermore even if you are pressed for time just resolve to have a fiveminute meeting in two days time for this one issue itd pass easily without bitterness and the setting of a truly awful precedent and i cant imagine youre going to have the stuff ready for formal submission before then anyways also in the amount of time you spent debating whether arithron could talk after the vote he could have typed up his response three times over word of advice to ari and all the other alternates who may find yourselves in this position  just say your piece and the debate over whether youre allowed to or not will end far faster continuing to read
okay finished reading i only have one more question that bit at the end where you guys knocked off issues in rapid succession by just voting on them why dont you do that more often discuss before vote during i acknowledge that the ccp forums are dreck and that you cant get a proper list of members for access control purposes to make such a forum work on this siteat least not until someone on ccps side swallows their pride and downloads some proper forum software instead of continuing to use the present abortion but isnt this why you registered a domain like wwwevecsmcom put up a discussion board make one section readonly for nonmembers and debate everything there or if that doesnt work for you  which given the history of updates on that site it might not  just figure out whats on the agenda in advance and talk about it in its own thread of course thatd mean longer debate but itd also mean better debate and shorter meetings given that you seem to be unable to finish meetings properly due to other commitmentsodd hours keeping the hours as flexible as possible by moving the bulk of the debate to a weeklong period instead of the meeting itself should allow more people to participateincluding the poor aussie though i see hes been attending more often lately for that matter i dont know why you even have meetings just vote on the forums if you use the offsite forums its even easy since any forum software worth its saltcough cough has polling options but even without those just posting i vote aye should do the trick
when is the next meeting we should really have on next sunday to catch up
oi i have a name you know  the reason i have been there more recently is due to the meeting start time being moved to 2am monday morning my time rather than the 4am it used to berant onanyway pretty much what you asked for has been suggested a few times already by multiple people involved in the csm i just find it ridiculous that the csm cant even post its meeting minutes to a ccp hosted site let alone have a subforum hat can have the discussions needed for the issues that do come up unfortunately it relies on the goodwill of serenity who hosts the mailing list and jade who is posting the minutes to his own corp forum if neither of them are in the next csm its going to be fun to see what happens to the information flowthis time i will point fingers  ccp your lack of support tools for the csm is a major problem and needs addressing immediately you demand a lot from the csm in both time and effort it would be nice to see the support from your end in basic functionality of information flow and dissemination1 a ccp hosted mailing list2 a ccp hosted csm forum for delegates to discuss issues3 a ccp hosted site for posting of meeting minutesagendasdocumentsall are needed before this situation turns into a complete farce when people start deciding they no longer want to donate their own personal servers to the causerant end

fraid not ccp asked us to submit batch 2 around now and so that is what we were doing batch 3 will go in in early october so that we can have the online discussion with them before we end our termswith the first batch we did indeed have a midweek finalising meeting but the chair didnt schedule one this time as it turned out we wasted so much time with some people deciding to take ages restating the issue that we went on for manytoomany hoursiz
around now doesnt have 2 days of leeway besides from the discussions it looks like itll take you 2 days to get the final submission documents ready anyways and if the chair didnt schedule a meeting then someone who knows how to work committee structures should have had a brief chat with the chair to explain the merits of not violating one of your more fundamental rules unnecessarily

right as you might have noticed i have been writing a bunch of topics which tries to address certain key issues which i see being the procedural issues for the csmi see a lot of discussion about the csm but i would like to have a discussionand gather feedback about what people think should be done in order for csm to improve based on this feedback its my intention to come up with a bunch of suggestions for changing the csm document in order to have the csm2 be a large improvement compared to csm1so lets gather up all the feedback and figure out how to improve this thing cheers
wee you have value to the communityps still glad i voted for you p
actually procedure is something that is vital to the csm however you have bypassed such procedure in the past and it is interesting that you now are campaigning for its importance for instance see meeting log on 17th august re forum 7 day rulewhat would be more helpful and constructive is discussion of issues before meetings interaction with players via the forums and adjustmentchanges made to issues to take account of player concernsinstead what we see are many illthought through issues being brought up at meetings and voted out we also see many issues at meetings that clearly are petprojects and there is a stubborn reluctance to alter ones own ideas or proposals to take account of other ideas etc this narcissistic method of operating is not conducive to productive csm meetings or an effective csmby discussion i mean discussion meetingsnot mailing issues and promptly ignoring replies if you get themtake carearithron
ideally what you want is a forum that is restricted to csmccp posters only though readable by anyone then when a topic in the assembly hall catches a csms eye they can create a topic in the csm discussion forum with links to the submission document so that all csm members can review the idea and post up their queriescomments at leisure then once the original topic has been on the board for 7 days the csm can move to vote on that issuethis would replace the current csm meetings with everyone in a single channel at a given timepros easier to give a clear and concise answer to queries as youre not having to break up your reply by the chat line limit this helps to avoid the current confusion when multiple people have queries that pop up in the middle of someone explaining their point issues get dealt with faster as you dont have to wait till the next batch of issues are dealt with timezone issues are eliminated for csm members as all discussionvoting does not rely on all the members being present at the same time less reliance on alternatives for the same reason an alternative should only be called to the csm should something happen to one of the main csm members that would prevent them taking part in csm business for an extended period of time eg holiday illness etcissues directly triggered from a dev blog should have a 7 day timer from the date of the dev blog not the date of the issue being raised in the assembly hallthere should be a mechanism in place to allow for time critical issues to be pulled forward from the 7 day limit for example had the issue concerning forum changes not been voted on last night then you would have had to wait 3 months before you could put it to ccp by which time the changes would likely have already been implementedthe proposed forum should be carefully monitored by ccp to allow speedy resolution of issues by getting a response from the correct dev on any given issue in the issue topic itself csm members can then debate with ccp any queries concerning the response once an issue has been resolved to the satisfaction of the csm that topic can then be lockedany face to face meeting with ccp should focus only on big picture issues and visions for the future general queries should be answered on the forum
it just seems like theres some sense of issue fatigue based on the last chatlog csm members either dont care about or fail to read up on or discuss some topics while other issues arent clearly written or are too heavy on details to summarizebasically prior to being brought up for a vote there should be some actual workshopping outside of the meeting by the csm so as to present something likely to be passed the actual inchannel meeting time is wasted without good preparationreally thats why you guys need a forum to discuss upcoming issues in and make changes to topics before they are formally presented and voted on
1 debate issues before the meeting not during on a publicly accessible forum of some type i dont care whether its the forum threads here a separate forum you create or what but your meetings go far too long because you try to do everything there 2 roberts rules of order this should have been literally the first vote at the first meeting without rules of order meetings are just catfights with a threadbare pretense of dignity 3 stop screwing with what rules of order you do have if theres a mandated 7day consultation then consult for 7 days dont just ignore it when you see fit theres plenty of ways to respect such requirements while still doing what you want to do dont ignore it and undermine yourselves when it is not absolutely necessary 4 you need better processes for picking issues right now you have eight people who submit pet projects and one guy who goes through and puts up everything that strikes his fancy that is not a reasonable system 5 too many good issues fall by the wayside some of that is a lack of community response but even the good ones that get enough supports to be reasonably considered2030 say dont always seem to make it im thinking moving to biweekly meetings was a mistake 6 would it be possible to find a friendly gm to sticky all the threads in the assembly hall that will be voted on at the upcoming meeting say send them a list on wednesdaywith the corresponding expectation that the agenda will be set by then and have them stickified until sunday evening that should give the community a better feedback mechanism since theyll know exactly what will be talked about 7 this ones a bit of a pet issue of mine given how often i do this but it seems like ideas proposed within threads often get overlooked and only the first iteration of the idea is considered thats not to say that all my ideas are good of course but id like to see the topic as a whole considered not just the original idea 8 this isnt something the csm can implement solo but the forum software is desperately in need of overhaul the standard assembly hall thread should be a proposal with a poll at the top of supportsupport with reservationsoppose to eliminate all the contentfree thumbs that have to be given out now also once polling is in place things like the supportoppose nano nerf threads can be moved to eve general where they belongand merged too and forums like fi can have another tool for feedback on ideasthats all ive got offhand though ill probably have more to say at a later date
there are such forums available they are called jita park and assembly hall count through the issues raised there and you can clearly see how much discussion and interaction issues get by csm members its not just input from csm on issues that is important player suggestions etc are just as valuableabove this discussion you need adjustment of stances and ideas by csm members that are going to bring the issue to the meetings for voting purposes when presented to meetings an issue should have already been through the development phase and be a much more robust issue for voting purposes accommodating concernssuggestions of players and fellow csm members bad ideas and issues should already have been clearly identified as requiring further development and worki disagree that the 7 day rule should be bypassed in any circumstances forums although useful do not affect ingame play or detract from eve in any ingame way otherwise 80 of the players are currently getting some lesser experience not everyone uses them at alltake carearithron
thanks for all the feedback so far i quite frankly agree with most if not all of the points made so farkeep it coming edit as for the point about the 7day rule in regards to our last meeting it was jade who put it on in my namei didnt request it exactly due to the 7day rule
im not really certain why you bother to have the get everyone into a chat channel for two hours meetings you could do all of that asynchronously on a forumthe csm could have a voting forum where every issue is a pollthread the poll options being vote yes and vote no an issue stays in the voting forum for a week during which time everyone can read up on the issue post discussion about it etcat the end of the week the poll is closed and the votes entered stand if someone didnt vote in the poll then they abstain read they vote no with a week to discuss and vote you can get rid of the votingduties of alternates except in extreme cases where someone goes on a twoweek vacation with no net access or whateverand as a bonus no one has to keep the minutes of the discussion  its right there on the forum as a permanent recordyou also wouldnt need anyone to moderate the discussion i mean you wouldnt need someone determining the order of when people speak when theyre talking too long etc
agreed however in both of those cases meaningful discussion on any topic is easily swamped by masses of spam posts could you imagine for example trying to keep track of a discussion in either one of the nanonerf threads in the assembly hall then multiply that by the number of hot topic debates that spring up this is why a forum dedicated to the csm is neededmeanwhile on the public discussion thread debate will continue and theres nothing stopping the csm from bringing decent alternative ideas into their discussion that have been raised on that threadin an ideal world that would be the case unfortunately a lot of the ideas hitting the assembly hall at the moment at least seem to be poorly thought out incomplete and jumbled in their implementationfor example the issue identified in the original post title is often not the issue that the proposal is designed to fix and even if it is the discussion thread often gets dragged off topic into whines concerning whatever the prevailant perceived problem of the month is ie nanos carebeargreifers being catered to too much delete as appropriate depending on whos posting 00empire arguementsas stated above this would help to keep the csm discussion on topicthe problem with this is simple yes the current issue was about the forums however say 5 days before the next submission deadline ccp announces a major change that does affect a large proportion of the eve player base for the sake of arguement lets use something extremely unlikely like concord will extend their wtfpwned protection down to 01 now you can be sure that there will be a massive outcry if that did happen with the playerbase calling on the csm to raise the topic as a wtf are you playing at ccp in this case should the csm bypass the 7 day rule or should they stick to the rule with the resulting silence from the csm being taken as tacit approval of the changes by ccp of the idea by the playerbase and the changes being implemented before the next csm deadlinei know in that case i would want the csm to be able to bend the rule
1csm needs a publicy viewable forum that only they can post in for discussion of the upcoming meetings proposals this should be done before the actual official meeting this will allow questioningclarification of proposals before the meeting regardless of timezones with csm members spread all over the world i see this as essential and reduce the time wasting that occurs with questions that have already been covered in the proposals it also allows the csm member to presentargue his proposal eloquently rather than during the meeting where time is limited assembly hall  swamped by spam lastly it will provide a legible record of all previous csm proposalsdiscussions for the next csm delegates when the voting rolls around again2csm should have already read the proposals that are on the agenda any csm who asks for an explanation of the current topic during the voting has obviously not read the agenda and as such should not be on the csm if they cannot even be bothered to do their basic homework theres a reason that meetings are overshooting timewise its because some csms arent doing what they are supposed to be doing and reading up on the proposals beforehand as a result of this time is wasted during the meetings as you have to go over the proposals again for whichever person has been lazy and not bothered preparing for the meeting if you do not have the timeinclination to do this then you should step down hell you shouldnt even have run for the csm in the first place3 current rulesprocedures must be stuck to no disregarding them because there is a particular issue that you personally want escalated 7 day rule is a prime example here procedurepoints of order are not up for discussion during the meeting they are meant to be followed discussion just wastes more time4 abstentions should be removed you are either for escalating the issue to ccp or you are against it abstaining shows that you either have no understanding of the proposal or just cant be bothered to make a decision either way it shows poor leadership and brings into question your suitability for the csm in the first place5 unannounced afks votes are being misseddefaulted because of unannounced afks csms have been given a position of responsability by the rest of the eve playerbase not bothering to let the rest of the council to know that you are going to be away because your dog got hit by a car or your house is on fire results in hold ups and missed votes i understand that with the meetings current length of time see points 1 and 2 above there may be the time that a person needs to go afk but these should be kept to the bare minimum and it is simple courtesy to let the chair know that this is going to happen6 when voting yesno csm members should be stating yes because  or no because  some csms do this already idealy i want to see all csm members doing this in addition if they have readdiscussed the proposals before the meeting they can prepare their answer before this so it should not add any extra time to the duration of the meeting7 dont waste time on uncessary buracracy i cant stress this enough whilst some of your proposals seem to have the right idea others just seem intent on adding uncessary rules for things which are covered by simple common sense or existing rules the recent highlow priorty vote proposal in a seperate thread you posted today is a prime example of this if something is under discussion by the csm then it already has a high priority any ordering of issues due to priority should be done by ccp and ccp only after the csm has submitted their proposals to them this is because only ccp has the knowledge of their road map and the difficulty level of proposed planssolutions the csm should not be wasting their time discussing rules for how to discuss the proposed issues
1 csmonly forum for discussion asked for since day 12 more communication with ccp i liked it when they asked for our stance on factional warfare we need a lot more of those inquiries3 a wiki or whatever to keep these issues organized in one central place its one big mess and im the one that has to clean it up all the time
59 small unit pvpers voted into the council next time ank counts as one btw  but seriously needs the csm post only forums and better overall forum functionality and it does need better infrastructure support from ccp next time around it cant be dependent on the chairvice chair to provide hosting for fundamental communications resources maybe some kind of each csm gets to pick 2 issues in each 14 day period they signal their advocacy by moving an issue thread to the csm only posting forum and have a debate in the individual threads voting at the end of the discussion phase i dunno something like that would be superior to what we have at the moment but the kicker is it takes forum assets and infrastructure support im pretty much convinced weve done the best with what we had this time around and unless ccp can provide more assets to the next csm it will have similar problems and potentially worse outcomes depending on the how much time and effort the new chairvice chair are prepared to devote to itbasically its support from ccp that is needed on the infrastructure though  not getting carried away with internal bureaucracy for the sake of it
i wouldnt put a cap on the number of issues members can bring up also the implied rate of 18 votes per 2 weeks is really low
agree with pretty much all of that except my outrageous rule breaking to get the forum topic in anyways  im an anarchist at heart i guess  rules are made to be broken if they need to be on that specific point i think because it wasnt much an actual issue we probably just need an alternative csm method of immediately addressing items of concern csm says please dont nerf the tech lab forum isnt exactly rocket science or a huge potential use of ccp dev time and in my opinion its utterly ridiculous to have that scale of csm function held to the same discussion time and submission process as a fullyfledged bounty huntingmerc proposalfor example some flexibility is needed as for the rest  completely agree on the responsibility of csms  hopefully next time around people thinking about running will look at this term and reach a more reasonable assessment for whether they believe they can actually devote the time csm isnt for everyone  it is a lot of hard work and can be extremely frustrating tbh its not glamorous either and feels more like jury service that being president things to bare in mind absolutely agree on 7  bureaucracy for the sake of it is total rubbish total waste of everyones time the prime thing this inaugural council has achieved is actually firing through a bunch of issues and getting them to ccp it has achieved something  its made it work getting tied down in the minutiae of committee government is just clerical fetish and needs hurling out of the window in the interests of actually addressing what the community wants us to address
all depends on the scale of the issues really and you mentioned somewhere else about the metrics for selecting these things at the moment there is no real guidance sure some have their pet projects  some like me like to pick and choose interesting sounding issues and advocate them the work rate of the csms varies a lot as you can see  putting a cap on the issues per session would stop frenetic csms dominating proceedings perhaps and make the electorate ask hard questions is certain csms were not advocating issues for their slots dunno its an interesting question
you seem to think rules exist to prevent you from doing your job if that is actually the case youre using the wrong rules various issues  the chairs power to mute or not how abstaining works etc  must be properly addressed for a meeting to function as anything other than a wrestling match disputes do arise and rules exist to provide a nonviolent way of settling those disputes admittedly violence is less of an issue when youre spread across four countries than it was in a medieval parliament but the principle stands this is why any wellwritten constitution has a fairly detailed set of fallback positions along with someone who can deal with the unforseen by fiat if truly necessarysee the kingbyng affair in canada the dismissal in australia or lincolns changing of the quorum rules of the us congress in the csms case those should be rro and xhagen  not jade  but insofar as those rules exist and are complete which generally they are they should be followed not flouted guidance shouldnt really be necessary  this is the sort of thing you guys should sort out on the mailing list okay guys we should probably be bringing forward about 20 issues a week so lets just have everybody pick 2 and then well take the 2 most popular that havent come up yet that might not be the best solution but its the best method for finding one imo figure out how much you want to discuss come up with an understanding no solid rules for something this ephemeral but there should be some discussion amongst you on how this all should function
a few interesting points raised so far that need some explanation1 can anyone state an issue that has achieved the 5 required player voting base and been immediately put on the agenda of a csm meetingi ask this because otherwise all issues appearing on an agenda are put there due to a csm member supporting the issue thus it follows that if the issue is poorly thought out inadequately explained or just simply a bad idea that wont workbenefit the players of eve the csm member that supported it is to be held at faultthis occurs often and the root cause of this is the total lack of interaction with players and interested parties via the forums supplied or the total ignoring of those players and interested parties when they opposesuggest alternate ideas etci can not agree with the argument that the forums are the reason that we cant discuss thingstoo many detractors etc it just smacks too much of a bad workperson blaming hisher tools the reasons bad issues make it as far as meetings are varied naivety on topicsareas ignorance of other ideasopinions failure to actually consider implications of issues failure to discuss and interact with playersinterested parties personal popularity for reelection kudos etc or just the plain stubborn reluctance to accept that their own ideas might not be as good as they thinkcntd
of course these arent all the reasons however more personal responsibilty by a csm member for their issue and their supposed desire to work for the benefit of the majority of players note not their own personal gain or their corpalliances interests etc would see less dubious issues doomed to be voted down put onto the agendaits obvious to see the benefit of hard work and proper discussion and interaction these issues generally are escalated to ccp2 i stated that under no circumstances should rules like the 7day rule be broken i highlighted this during the meeting and i stand by it now major changes to the game will result usually in a dev blog with a forum thread started for player responses and discussion the devs read and respond on these threads so obviously this is an instant vechile for voicing concerns etc indeed many changes implemented turn out to be good despite the doombringers predictions these dev threads work remember the forum changes proposed last year for instance the csm by not stating anything to ccp are by no means agreeing by silence to ccp about changes an issue can be raised be discussed and brought up in the next meeting i find it sad that players think ccp would implement changes without thinking through the consequences they have produced a bloody good game as far as i am concerned and i trust them to continue to improve itlimiting the amount of issuesvotes etc for a csm rep are not answers to the problems currently faced a lack of communication as with any council or organisation is solely to blame communication with players communication between the csm members and communication with those with opposing viewpoints or experience in a different sphere within gametake carearithron
even after the requirement was lowered nothing has yet gotten particularly close all against the nano nerf is i think the most popular thread but its not an issue its just in the assembly hall for the polling mechanic cant really argue with that there havent been a lot of dumb ideas brought forward all told but the ones that have been are the fault of the member who did the goal is to have a forum where csms can discuss and everybody can read no such forum exists and given ccps current forum software it cant exist on the eve site it doesnt cripple the csm but its the primary reason why meetings take so long as long as theyre following through on their election platform i dont even object to them going for pet issues but yes trying to put together support for your ideas makes them more successful come voting time whod have thought thinking through the consequences is not always enough  ccp seems to be blindsided by player opinion on many issues expressing those opinions is the csms primary job i agree though that process is important
hmm all this talk of guidelines and rules for the next csm makes me nervouswhat the problem really boils down to is a total lack of communication between members with preconcieved ideas about other members from the start playing a major role in thisjust because the current csm or parts of it failed in adhering to guidelines setout by ccp or ignored underlying principles of the csm and its mandate doesnt mean the next csm council willfrom the outside looking in it looks like any failures you are implying are simply due to a lack of teamwork its a pity because there are members committed to making eve a better and richer game for players and players who want to be members with the same desiresdont go hamstringing the next csm with new guidelines and constitutions just because you couldnt work as a team this timetake carearithron
here it is as i would post itthis proposal includes a coordinated set of ideas that encompass changes to 00 sov warfare and the roles of supercaps caps and subcaps the idea is that all of these concerns are so tightly related that its easier to try and solve all the problems together than to come up with piecemeal solutions so this is not pickandchoose its allornone here are the problems the solution tries to solvein sov warfare there is only one case where you would prefer to have a pilot in a subcap rather than in a capship and that is a cynojammer takedown seems like people would prefer that subcaps have more purpose in sov warfare that cant be better filled by capsaccording to ccp sov warfare needs a place for small gangs to contribute read a step in sov warfare that cant be totally blobbed and can be done in subcapsthe costbenefit analysis for living in 00 is not favorablesome people want roaming gangs to be able to do some level of infrastructural damage in conquerable space but allowing that makes problem 3 even worseone ship killing 200 other ships by pushing one button is not very funand here are some good things about living in 00 that the proposal tries not to mess upthere are massive fleet battles featuring huge expensive capital and supercapital shipsit takes 1 to effectively wage sov warfarethose who have the best organization of the most dedicated players have the best chance of succeeding in 00onto the changesnew sov warfare system  planetary basesintroduce a new sovholding structure the planetary base pb which is anchored at a planet moonanchored pos no longer contribute to sov each pb is associated with a set of five planetary defense stations pds with are located on different grids one au or so from the pb pbs get the set of anchorable offensive and defensive modules that pos currently get in the live game however cynojammers jump bridges cyno beacons and other noncombat modules can only be anchored at posthe process of destroying a pb is exactly like destroying a pos except that after the pb comes out of reinforced it continues to be invulnerable until repped or until three out of its five pds are incapped once the planetary base is vulnerable it remains so as long as three out of five pds are incapped the pds are designed to be subcap objectives think of them like station services with far far fewer hp 20 bs should be able to take one out in twenty minutes or so however the pds are selfrepairing around 10 minutes after being incapped the pds come back online with full hp consequently teams of subcaps from an attacking fleet need to constantly work to keep the majority of the pds down while the main fleet attacks the pb the hp of the pb should be such that you can finish one off in two fullyutilized windows of opportunity with a fleet that includes 35 or so dreads the hp is a tweakable balancing pointpds can only be targeted during the window of time after a pb exits reinforced and before the pb is repped optional idea while the planetary base is vulnerable the guns at the planetary base dont fire you could dream up other bonuses gained from disabling more than 35 pdsi have put a little faq at the end that explains how this addresses problems 1 and 2 abovepos changes  small gang harassment targetswith pos no longer being sovholding structures they can be made more vulnerable to attacks by roaming gangs that want to attack infrastructure
move all pos facilities moonmining research production storage etc outside of the pos shields the modules can be incapped by roamers to temporarily disable their function but to destroy them an attacker must first destroy the pos control tower when a pos module that contains a resource eg harvested moon mins or reaction products is incapped some percentage of its contents are ejected into space for the harassers to keep the process for destroying a pos should remain the same but reduce the offensive modules anchorable at a pos so as to make the pos modules reasonably vulnerable to harassment read a limited number of small guns along with the normal neuts scrams ecm etcpos keep their current level of shields so theyre still reasonable to use as staging structures during an invasion of a hostile system but see the titan change further down as well the hp of the modules that will now be outside of the pos shields is a balance pointpos changes  reducing the upkeep costincreasing profitabilityassumedly some people will actually go around incapping moonmining modules and so forth which is going to hurt the profitability of living in 00 which is already not so hot to overcompensate reduce the cost of maintaining the network of pos and increase their rates of production decrease the upfront cost of a pos reduce control tower base costs and increase the droprates for faction tower bpcs reduce the rate of pos fuel and trade goods consumption increase silo and fuelbay size to reduce the amount of tedious upkeep effort this is on top of the fact that under the new sov warfare system described above you can probably get by with fewer pos to begin with increase reaction rates and min harvesting rates to overcompensate for the potential loss of resources to raiders because this will affect the global supply of reaction products it will probably be necessary to adjust the amounts of reaction products needed for t2 production in a playerbased economy like eve if youre not increasing profitability by opening up a new market adding a new game mechanic then youre achieving it by wealth transfer the t2 market is the vehicle for transferring wealth from elsewhere into 00how does this help the average joe maybe if your alliance has a lower upkeep cost for maintaining the empire it will reduce your taxes some i mean probably theyll just use the extra isk to buy some jerk a mothership who will then never log in again but the proposal cant be blamed for that titan changes  make them deathstarlike xdin order to keep titans from dominating the defense of the pds we need to get rid of the aoe doomsday the new titan gets two modes of operation one offensive and one defensivein offensive mode the titan is mobile and can use its doomsday device however replace the aoe effect with a very powerful singletarget damage effect sufficient to alpha any one capital ship the exact damage is a tweakable balance pointin defensive mode the titan is completely immobile but projects its shields outward as a poscaliber forcefield and can use its jump bridge and when i say completely immobile i mean unbumpable but also unable to engage jump drives when in defensive mode the titans shield capacity is multiplied up to about the level of a large pos the exact hp is a tweakable balance point a titan can act as a staging point for an invasion in a pinch although obviously you cant it into a cynojammed system and it wont go into reinforced when it gets into armor it just dies really quicklythe titan can switch modes on a longish cooldown balance pointcreditsthis proposal is the result of fahtim meidiress thread several people contributed to it and i wasnt the main one
the whole thing about the titan should be better fleshed out i guess for example what if a titan in defensive mode at half shields switches to offensive mode does it get all its shields back or does it keep the same ratio half shields what if a titan goes into defensive mode near the undock of a station such that hostile craft undock into the posshieldlike shieldsi mean there are pretty obvious answers just need to do the due diligence to decrease the extent to which the idea can be nitpicked apart maybe when im bored at work ill write even more words
if proposed at this stage were weak on the extra benefits afforded to 00 alliances for having to put up with more crap from losec raiding parties thats a definite hit at the council
that looks really good toman a couple academic pointsyou probably dont have to worry about fleshing out the details too too much as long as there is a clear statement of what the balance intent is i think you hit a good tone with the pos logistics simplification stuff as its not overly specific but basically says make it less costly to run to balance the raiding so with the titan changes id just highlight the purpose behind it and not worry too much about length of cooldowns etca small point to add about raiding id like to see the potential for actual theft of resources  fuel or moon minerals  from a successful raid maybe some percent of what is stored can be siphoned off and to balance that theres a small bump in production rates in addition to the other overhead reductions that have been discussedother than that i think it looks good and stressing the point that we are recommending balance points for ccp to use for each of the changes is a great strength of the proposal i think as long as we avoid getting unnecessarily specific people will be able to read through it and understand what the changes entail without getting hung up on misinterpretation of details dont worry too much about having to cover every possible interpretation i think just having an answer ready the faq idea was good is plenty sufficient if they dont get it they can read this thread to understand the idea better
posted in the assembly hall
nice work everybody
not going to be a party crasher at assembly hall but i think you jumped the gun no new improvements to 00 profitability to make up for the increase in overhead from raidingnot that they are hard to fix but id just started up a thread with a proposal for some new incomevulnerabilities that would have taken care of these issues considering this is aimed straight at dariuss objections to adding more granularity to warfare im surprised it hasnt gotten into the mixanyway all in all still a good proposal changes to sov i dont think could be much better glad the titan changes snuck in there antisupport nerf been needed for some time
he included mention of it nande i think youd be stepping on a land mine by trying to legislate exactly how 00 should be more profitable when all you need to do is say when implementing this 00 profitability has to be balanced along with it should something like this make it into the game theyd have to do plenty of testing and balancing to figure out just how much of an impact raiding ends up making and how best to balance it out so theorizing that deep at this point is unnecessary  itll get sorted out along the way
considering other proposals that are already escalated i know poss are headed for some reworking still yet theres nothing in there about what keeps a zealot coming in a 3am and dodging pos fire for a few hours while chipping away at a mining array and there are some staunch voices opposing any new vulnerabilities to 00 for good reason i dont think we got it fleshed out enoughbut yes you see my thumb on the proposal and id like to see how far it can go for now as well as testing the reaction of all the assembly readers
imo more eyes need to be on it before it can be improved any further thats why i posted iteither this one will make it or well get some more information and be able to enjoy writing another iteration longass forum posts are all about the journey not the destination
fair enough ill lay low for a few days have some breakdancing to do in rl
truer words were never spoken
we have lately seen that there amount of issues being submitted has increased quite a bit we are dealing with a ton of issues with very different levels of reach in terms of the amount of users it impactsheartsone wrote a very reasonable post on what i will be discussing herei agree that csm will have to prioritize all these issues and that was also what ccp suggested for us to do in order for us to let them know what we see as important issues we did this last time by creating a priority list but it would be a very good idea to do it proactively tooit would work like this whenever a vote is being had instead of a binary value for if the issue should be escalated all votesincluding no should have a low medium or high attribute this means that we will be able to assemble a priority list in a fair way once we face ccp and get the feedback a new round of votes should be had in order to make any last minute changes to this priority list based on ccps feedback which will then make up the final list which will be submitted to ccp the voting options would be lower current or higher priority this means you can change the position of an issue quite easily this changes the council from being just all about escalationno  which i think is dearly neededwhat do you guys think
you lot run out of time on just voting whether to escalate or not so stuff gets pushed back to the next meeting as well as delegates dropping in and out of the meetings this also points to poor planning by the meeting organiser if your not checking for optimum times as well as a lack of application by the delegates doing it if you cant manage a weekly meeting then maybe you shouldnt have applied for the jobhow will adding an extra layer of bureaucracy speed up the processok just read the last meeting minutes the dropping inout wasnt as bad as the previous one so it looks like a better time was picked for all persons involved this time so disregard that point however the original point still stands how will adding extra bureaucracy help here
lmao  why complicate matters during meetingswhy not just have a list disseminated to the mailing list before items are sent to ccp the delegates can then rank that list according to importance and based on that compile the final ranking
i dont exactly think it will add complexity lets have a look what i am suggestingthe current situation is like thisyesornovery simple the amount of either of them decides if its escalatednow we add another value to this which makes it look likeyes high or yes medium or yes loworno low etc etc etcits still only the first parameter which decides if it goes to ccp thus it will not add complexity beyond having a person just put the vote together and read which priority the issue will getthis is much more efficient than the way we used in iceland it would have to be done during the meeting because the person who does the yesno would also have to specify the priority if we had to do it at the end of a cycle between each issue list being sent to ccp imagine the complexity that it would be trying to figure out for each issue who should vote on the priority
i agree with omberall issues making it as far as a csm meeting are or should be by virtue important issues id question why issues that are low priority are even making it that far since if it has the player support it must be important and be prioritised as suchtake carearithron
well thats a nice illusion its nothing like thatthere will always be lowpriority issues
i agree that issues have variable priority i disagree with the idea that you should enumerate that priority off the top two reasons one ccps input on how easyhard it is to change something and how well it fits in with their existing plans for the futurelike my offhand comment about reading the forums in the igb and then finding out that the igb is slated for demolition matters a great deal when determining an issues priority two given how chaotic your meetings are and the fact that you often proceed on a 61 vote with 9 in the room i cant imagine how you expect a 4option voting systemor perhaps even a 6option if nays can also assign priorities to result in answers for that matter given your collective habit of procedural wrangling and the continuing absence of rules of order i imagine that the first vote you hold under this system will take 45 minutes result in a conclusion acceptable to nobody and result in at least one person ragequitting if there is an actual consensus on an ideas priority include it in your submitted documents if theres not just submit it no need to complicate a voting system that doesnt work particularly well asis
can we have an example of a low priority issue then im suspecting that one persons low priority is anothers high priority interaction with ccp before assigning priority as discussed above must be a required part of a responsible csm decisionmaking processtake carearithron
please note that there will be a reprioritization after we talk to ccpso this is just a nice way of implementing prioritiztion prior to talking to ccp as well as afterwards in order to compile a priority list with as little work as possible
granted but i dont see why its necessary beforehand the next 24 submission roundsdepending on when the next csms iceland trip is will be email based theres no real limit on agenda time for those as far as id go with preemptive prioritization is the previous proposal to make some submissions response only
this post by herschel sums it up nicely imo
damn good idea one more way to alliance overlords to extort the sht out of their plebesgive covops bs this ability as well allowing infiltrators to have an accurate assessment of system activity it shows names standings dockedundockedshielded status but only functions while the bs is cloaked finding  decloaking it kills the infiltrators subinfo networkalso the basic level local network would show activity timer so you know when that cov spy is afk d activity means warping and scanning not just a mousetwitch every 15 seconds or the afk pilot active in multiple random channels ectthe eve client should be more anal about activity timers and detection algorythms and once it suspects a cloaked ship is afk for more than say an hour esp if some activity macro behavior is detected it decloaks the ship if a macro is detected it warps the decloaked cloaker to a belt if theyre not afk theyll freak out over this and react quickly thus theyre actively playing
nice idea may i suggest instead of tieing it to a pos make it a distructable station service much like the medical but alow it to reach out and tie in with other staions in the constilation also make it vulnerable to a hacking mod loaded with nano virus goo oh it would be nice to include the logistics class of ships in this idea maybe
its interesting but i dont see this as a good idea it makes communications way too complicated and only benefits 00 alliances i say no
good idea
i understand how you want to implement your idea but why why do you want to introduce this  that is in no way clear to me
the local issue is a hot topic it has been debated among players a lot and ccp has also told that it is planning to do something with it there were several topics about local here on csm for example simply removing it or swapping obligatory local to obligatory constellation chat this idea is the best i have seen so far so go go go 1 support it nerfs local which is a good thing but it nerfs it in a way that you can dampen the nerfing effect if you do for it it gives advantage to those who are fighting in their own territory let it be 00 or in empire in the territory of their chosen faction and it favours those who work in teams roaming gangs with recons the only group who is definitely put into disadvantage by this are the solo ninja npcers but thats okay to me some parts of the proposal need refinement it is not obvious how the standingbased access and the payforservice method can coexist and the balancing needs to be done properly but the idea itself is great
thx ill try to answer in short to your concernsblob warfare issue if the network hub module is outside the forcefield and 10ish black ops ships can disable it quickly then the anchorable hub module isnt so overpowered right  ccp will surely balance this if this my proposal gets troughdefenders receive more love with the current sov system you are right its no too complicated getting sov3 the only necessary condition is time yes and you have to defend it too but there are discussions about sov change too i dont think my proposal could get into game before a sov finetune also if there are only 12 hub modules in system its no too complicated to force the defenders to also use recon ships as backup if there are lots of deadstars with hub modules in hte system then defenders deserve their local for their fuel imho this seems balanced to merecon ships yep looks like you missed it there are a few thoughts hereeccmew black ops hacking cloaking i will answer this in my next post because of 358 char left only in this one 
outside the pos modules have been the laughingstock of ccp they promised us with the change of modules outside that small gang pos warfare would be possible i have no faith that ccp can continue with any outside pos module without completely revamping the whole sov mechanic and with the shredder pos around everywhere to protect cyno jammers they would be included in those or made specifically for neural nets black ops are currently in a prenerfed state they cant cyno into a system with a jammer so its a null point to use them specifically against a pos and to basically ask people to use tech two ships against laggy mechanics that fire through them with massive range and the precision of gunners i can not think that any pos module would be anywhere near a good thing in fact if it was a pos module i would think it another kick in the shin to the sov warfare and game in generali really think your system is too unbalanced you propose to give defenders who often have lvl 3 the ability to have what is in effect better than current local in terms of it lets you know who exactly left which is useful in populated systems and you give a ships that are covert operations scouts with basically no combat and reconnaissance ships the ability to give paltry information and do it in a vulnerable state with fuel consumption they cant carry probes plus fuel and be delayed using the magic module to know how many people are in system to know if they should even drop probes what you are in effect doing is slowing down the time it takes a recon to assemble any useful information from when they jump in by a severe amount  jump in get past any camps decloak activate magic module move around to not get scanned wait for results of numbers in system move some more decide whether numbers in system qualify for dropping probes move more drop probes relay information to friendliesany level 3 system will have their ratters and vulnerable assets loooong goneany system with a neural net on a pos surely will have a system scanner as they are cheap and super powerful you are hovering on the edge of time it takes an enemy to scan and warp in on a target before he can get results and to be honest knowing the local count isnt much intel for that riskits tough to propose a system so tied to sov when we clamor for changeccp proposed in a sov change they thought of making a deployable offensive cyno jammer there could be something like that for neural nets i supposei await what you have planned for the hostile forces as you havent had time to explain that yet as you are still forming up your proposal
hacking and eweccw to be honest id skip this in the first version if the 10 version is working without lagging to hell then these could be cool stuffs i could have mention this in the opening post but it seems to me people are already skipping paragraphs with this the description would be epic long and the whole idea would be more complex than id like to keep in mind actually i have some fresh ideas see black ops but i dontt know how would these impact the server side what if it would get extra load because of one ew stuff if it would cause extra lag imagine what if 200 people are starting to hack i would be cursed for a lifetime thats why i picked cheap and safe solutions which should not cause significant surplus load to any nodeblack ops after reading a couple times im more and more sure i should have pay more attention on my english classes i could not figure out the pointabout black ops they also could receive the ability to fit a mobile network hub like the combat recon ships but im afraid this would make them pwnmachines or they could fit scramblers which makes them harder to detect a scrambler module black ops only module could dampen the effectiveness by 1 or just set level 1 of hostile networks affecting the black ops ship onlycloaking cloakers force recon covert ops should receive some tweaking id say they sould receive bonus in cloaked state against detection but im against to boost them more than enable cloaked scanning see the part about recon ships they sould get only one of these regular ships should not receive any kind of bonus in cloaked state than they are cloaked
do cloaked ships show up in local count or any way while cloaked
you got some valid points but as i stated before this is just a plan the whole stuff is adjustable the only important point is the chance of local management i could not spent enough time with everelated stuff lately work summer girls so it seems i could not spend enough time with think this over and over and get a good balance but i dont think this is a big problem the main point is already written in the short description in the opening post if this passes trough ccp will finetune it anywaysif you could suggest a better balance id welcome it if you have more well thought out suggestions i wont be shy to give credit
i think regular ships should show up in cloaked state also just like uncloaked force recon ships covops maybe black ops with ew are a good question id say let them see in local count but you probably wont like this answer  there are pros and cons in this situation and i drunk some beer after work so let me think on the stuffs you mentioned till tomorrow
make a tl dr post i cant quite understand all that has been written in 3 max length replies
i think that recons would become too UFFFDber if they could evade being counted on local just imagine you move into some enemy system with sov34 full of people you hit the cloak in your rapier  arazu and noone notices any hostile presence in system while you are ganking people in belts one thing is sure whenever a ship enters a system there should a notification about it no matter what but as i pointed out above i think they should be accounted for all the time if the nerural network level is high enough
i think the exact details have some problems but the overall idea is a very good one change intel away from being chatbased and towards being intelbased this makes sense on every level i assume that when this change is made local chat will go to being a membershipoptional hiddennames chat channel also just to throw out some different numbers how about this level 1 60 second delay names of friendliesas defined by mutual 0 standings and total numbers only provided by concord to all highsec pilots above 20 sec or provided by a minimal scanning infrastructure1 scanner active level 2 30 second delay names of all pilots provided by factions to all highsec and lowsec pilots in factioncontrolled space above 20 standing or provided by sov 2 and a reasonable scanning infrastructure3 scanners active level 3 no delay all names and what ships everyone is flying provided by scan probeprobably a new variety or provided by sov 3 and a large scanning infrastructure6 scanners active also provided to anyone who has a ship using one of these scan probes as a designated booster in gangor perhaps add a skill for how far the bonus extends level 4 no delay all names and ships and the ability to warp to anyone as if they were in gang provided exclusively by sov 4 and a massive scanning infrastructure10 scanners active a cloaked ship is scanned as though the intel source is 1 level lower level 1 doesnt count them level 2 doesnt name them level 3 doesnt tell you what ship theyre inand still operates under a delay and level 4 doesnt let you warp to them a cloaked ship is still unscannable and it provides a reasonable defence against enemy intelgathering but its a clearly delineated bonus and i feel its of an appropriate size scanners would be relatively large and expensive pos modules or otherwise modules on whatever the most appropriate structure is if 00 infrastructure is changed dramatically also all names provided would be sorted by alliancecorporation a quick glance at show info is automatable imo and you could see the lists with the usual  to expandtype compression itd make searchingespecially in places like jita far easier also of course access to a scanner network could be rented out  i imagine cva would make a pretty penny off that service i think this has a few advantages over the ops proposal for one level 1 and 2 are more clearly distinguished and there are real advantages to running your own scanning infrastructure instead of relying on the npc one only players can hit scanning level 3 and 4 for two cloaking has advantages including the fact that you can never be scanned out but anyone with a scan probe can still find out who you are i also like the cloaks degrade intel 1 level aspect for three its better defined outlining exactly what bonuses are attained from standings modules and sovereignty
still waiting  can a csm please comment on the status of this issue
yes please look into this the wreck and contents should be property of the person who caused it
i believe that when i get blown up the stuff in the wreck is mine not yours for blowing me up npcs are different altogether and you cant compare them to pcs just because you blow my ship up does not entitle you to loot my wreck looting my wreck should be another offense the only time i think you should get rights to the wreck is when you are at war with the guy killed
no and its a ridiculous suggestionthe loot belongs to the guy you just killed not you
im guessing the op didnt see the part where the devs have said they dont even like war decs as they now stand its just a wild hunch but its a pretty good bet that making them more profitable ahead of some other changes to them being made isnt going to be too high on the developer priority listfrom the grumblings theyve made about them were probably going to see a fairly serious revamp of how war decs work and corpsalliances who do them as a profit making scheme are probably not going to like the outcome
whats wrong with that if youre willing to pay someone to powerlevel you why shouldnt you be allowed and its not like itd be especially fast  storylines dont provide large bumps to faction standings and theyd be even smaller once you start splitting them 2or 10 ways
the mutual exclusion standing mechanics do suck for pirate factions as it stands now youd think that doing missions for gallent should get you  to guristas for example both being fairly anticaldari it shouldnt be standing to any empire  standing to all pirate factions

the nano nerf is to hard hitting one is needed jsut not the one ccp is planing
while i am still against nerfing local this is the best proposal for an alternative that i have seen so far not just remove localit is interesting but seems like a lot more work which might not actually be a bad thing if these was actually implemented it would certainly change the way a mining op is runbut i still see it favoring pirates and other criminals i still would like to know who is enteringleaving the system more importantly what their standing is to memy corpab
aiden it is obvious that this solution would need to do reverse standing lookups if you go to a sysetm with low scanning level and the system is only supposed to show the names of the friendlies its not their standing towards you that matters not the standing you have set towards them or you could just put everyone to 10 and see it all
hell yes
supportedi also support falafel and hummus
i see nothing but good from this idea
not bad of an ideahowever you could just create an alt and use it as your savings account too
i dont know if this has been mentioned but as i see it its a matter of taticswhen a ceptor sees a battleship warp away it should be albe to warp past it and be ready and waiting when it comes out assuming you know where its going in larger systems this isnt a problem as much as long as the bs isnt making short warps i would figure smaller ships should be able to get there faster significanly if the warpspeed is 45 times and that doesnt happen on smaller warps

changes seem sensible
for it
for goonswarm to farm them they would have to have missions in conquerable space
no take away my only source of income ingame and i simply stop playing you need isk to play and its that simple dont ruin that just because you want more vulnerable targets in low sec pft
so how do minershisec explorers get by
no if u do lvl4 mission u cant avoid pirates if u go into a lowsec and u make mission there i would kill u sooner or later but i think sooner
and thus the l4 mission runners would need to either organize defense or give up their lucrative trade oh my that sounds terrible
i doubt it
i think this is a terrible ideai think the consequences of this change include an extreme drop in overall mission running its much less safe a large drop in subscribers from those based on solo pve significant change in overall eve economy this is a huge isk source at the very least prices on most named mods rigs and minerals jump significantly and the overall isk put into the game drops making those price hikes even more significant as finding good named gear is harder the gap between those able to afford and use t2 cheap now due to invention and those who cant widens new players have a tougher time ship pvp becomes essentially required for anyone interested in playing longer than the 23 months it takes to do all that empire has to offer for little isk those who continue to run missions band together out of necessity more targets for pvp more significant resources in lowsec to fight over 00 potential boostedi dont really thing the pros outweigh the cons here thats my opinioni think the real problem is not that highsec needs a nerf but that lowsec needs a boost as soon as lowsec becomes more attractive than highsec taking all aspects into consideration pilots will naturally move to lowsec i think it should be easy to add new valuable and interesting game elements to lowsec boost mission rewards significantly 2x better minerals and mining significantly better exploration sites etc 00 may be fine im speaking here about 0104 if i made more isk in 03 after costs logistics new clones replacement ships etc were taken into account than i do in 06 id go to 03 but thats just not the case but it should be imhospecifically for hisec explorers  they dont i did some highsec exploration some time ago and spent far more on the probes than the sites i found were worth it was a colossal waste of time and isk exploration has no purposes whatsoever outside of lowsec  00 and if you make it so that all that happens in highsec is trading and mining tldr  highsec doesnt need a nerf lowsec needs a boost
there are something like 23 high sec regions with low sec in them and something like 40 00 regionsyet the 00 pvp types still feel the need to have the 23 nonhigh sec regions opened up for pew why we i include myself cause this is an empire alt pvp types cant find something to do in all that spaceyeeshlets leave the carebears alone and fix the blob issues first
i apparently have more to saylets assume that this is a good idea then all that has to happen is that running missions in lowsec needs to be lucrative enough to make similar amounts of isk with similar effort in similar time okay so lets crunch some numbersassumptions1 it takes a whole hour to probe out a mission runner this seems high really i would expect a good prober to be much faster than this2 mission runners dont fit for pvp so getting caught means death3 a good mission running fit is going to run about 125 million more or less standard tech ii raven about 50 million including insurance to replace4 theres one pirate for every 10 mission runners in a system5 logistics wise it takes one hour to find and fit a new ship if the old is destroyed6 the average level 4 mission runner makes 20 million  hour bountieslootsalvageso given these assumptions every ten hours of missioning results in one lost ship which requires 50 million and an extra hour to replace it so roughly 10 of the time is lost on extra logistics and an extra 50 million is requiredover that time period 10 hours the current profitability is generously 200 million so now over 9 hours 250 million so thats a boost of about 40therefore just to break even the missions in question need to be boosted by 40 to make people happy about this youre going to have to tack on at least 2550 more as ive conveniently excluded logistics new clones implants etc in most of the above calculation all of which hurt the mission runner iskwiseso roughly speaking i think this isnt an all bad proposal if the bounties rewards and bonuses on all lowsec level 4 missions were appropriately adjusted but the adjustments have to be to what appear to be ludicrous levels for this to be a good ideaalso this assumes you fly a raven if you fly a golem 600 million isk replacement costs well say you had better be making about 90 million  hour running these missions in other words that entire ship class becomes worthless and it existed only to run missions in the first place so yeahnot signed
youre assuming that a pirate that successfully scans a mission has a 100 chance of getting a kill simply by using the scanner and clicking it once a minute or so the missionrunner can lower that percentage drastically were i hunting mission runners in 00 i dont think id use probing as my primary method of catching them youre also assuming that the mission runners behave in exactly the same way in 00 as they would in hisec so safespots no scouts no teamwork no preparation i would like to think that even the cariest of carebears might do things a little differently in 00  call me an optimist
highsec is not now nor was it ever meant to be some kind of pvpfree zone
i disagree with this idea for many reasons1 it is relatively easy to raise from lvl 1 to lvl 4 missions the only constraint being the time it takes to be able to effectively use the right ship for these missionswhile raising skills to be able to use a bs for instance many people just do lvl 3 missions deny them that and you push em back to lvl 2 missions it creates a gap in ones skill development which is already a hot topic amongst nonniche players that experience eve for the first time2 pve and pvp are two completelly different beats in eve you cant effectivelly pvp with a pve setup and vice versa different modules and setups are required most of the timeso you will be throwing sheep to the wolves if people have to travel to pvp areas with pve setupsit is counter productive and it is no ones fault but the nature of the design3 it takes a long time to move from one game layer to another in eve not everyone wants to join a big corp in sovereign space when they start eve some prefer to explore eve with their own group of friendstake for instance anew corp for it to go to 00 and start working on sovereignty can take a minimum of a year high missions in high sec are the way these corps can amass the necessary funds and establish the necessary organization to be able to support the logistics involved with 00 play4th some corps just dont have the ambition for 00 not interested and wish to remain empire citizens all their live having fun in the game such a move would be perceived as forcing them towards a direction that ha little interest and is therefore unfun for them the game as it is right now offers the choice like any sand box game should to many styles of play and enjoyment5th risk vs reward cant be applied when the sought after reward is simply fun you cant impose a rule to the player saying if you want to have fun you have to risk yourself and many people play to have fun not have isk or expensive modules just simply funif you want to make eve an even smaller niche by removing the possibility of the game to be fun to some people go right aheadthere is other games to play in that case
obviously my assumptions are going to be flawed because calculating the actual costs of lowsec mission running is an extremely hard problem in way too many variables for a forum post the whole point of my post is that if you want mission runners happy to go to lowsec the applestoapples comparison had better make fiscal sense  in other words my analysis above is based on the assumption that these carebears are generally playing the same way in lowsec that is alone and i think for the vast majority of mission runners it is a solo activity  group activity is fun but most people are on their own because group play is less lucrative generally for level 14 missions a group of 3 people running level 4 missions make less than 3 individuals each running a level 4 mission unfortunately not for younger players but once youre able to solo them yourself its a solo thingthose that play intelligently will come out far ahead and those that play less wisely will come out far behind of course but were already talking about an essentially solo profession so my estimates have to be based on solo play  no scouts no logisticsall im really trying to say is if you want mission runners happy to go to lowsec youd better pull out the giant isk signs and plant them squarely on the other side of that 0504 gate or else theyre just not going to go happilyto rephrase yet another way from the carebear missioners perspective it has to be worth it to risk ship life implants modules ammo and loot  all the time  there had better be a jolly huge pot o gold on the other side of that rainbow since all that risk has to be piled upon what is essentially a riskless activity there have to be huge bonuses piled on the alreadyexistent rewards

must say that i beleive you have all come up with a very good and acceptable proposal to combat the nightmare that is 00 sovereignty warfare this appears to be a well constructed and thoughtout set of ideas that when combined make a positive step towards a new sovereignty enginecongrats and you have my support
againstsolely because of thisyou can make much more money in 00 with half a brain then you can make in high if you cant afford losing money due to a small gang raiding your space and cutting off your economic modulesthen you really shouldnt have that system to begin with shrink and consolidatefor the most part i like your proposal with the exception of increasing money flow in null space it would be more appropriate to propose everything you have without the increase moon mineralsdecrease pospos fuel costs in money but with a caveat that the economics of living in 00 would need to be closely watchedprove that it would get more expensive before increasing iskies in the gamereally well thought out thoughi very much liked where you were going with it other then the economy thing
agreed i love my little drones but sometimes i swear theyre trying to make me hit them
dont forget the fighters which engaged follow the target warping out  very enoying if you want to switch targets

i dont see the issue with people saying it would be weird for drones to pass through asteroids and suchdont missiles and every other weapon do that as well
yeah these bugs suck signed

this did not get much attention but imo is spot on there are a lot of materials that can be synthetized from other raw materials it probably would be less efficient than mining dymprosium directlly but still would give the option to produce synthetic materials this an be extended to other areas as well imo this is a winwin situation it gives an edge to the moon owners over synthetic producers which would still need to work hard to produce it it allows competition without monopolization of resources and it boosts the industry in the game which is allways a good thing1 to that suggestion
i dont think the solution is depletion of moonsdifferentiate the output of moons step one make low ends output more and high ends lessstep two make all moons offer more different resourcesstep three make it possible to mine multiple deposits of the same resourceso in effect alliances could still dominate high ends but the number of moons they would have to cover would be larger they would be attracted to moons with multiple high end deposits
aye i really like that one as well
answers are always nice especially when they come from the people who matter
i personally think t2 bpos should be removed from the game it however should be fair and the current t2 bpo holders need to be compensated appropriately with that thought i would be interested in what ccp has to say on this issue
not without a much more significant increase in dps than has been suggested already omnitanks are much less effective than one thats designed for just one or two damage types so a mere 150 increase in dps output with a shift to racial damage types makes the change essentially meaninglessthat said i support the concept in principle
sentry guns are fine as they are
replace or enhance if you must sentries with roving npc patrols
why not increase the dps but give them worse tracking or a larger signature resolution so smaller ships will still take some damage but larger ships wont be able to just sit on the gate tanking the guns indefinitelyi have no problems with gate camps etc i just dont see how battleships etc should be able to sit on a gate permatanking the guns while smartbombing with relative impunity
yea ok if you make it too hard to tank in the ships currently camping the gates you will see a return of the mizh smarty gate camps you know the one where he sits on the hek gate in otou in his nyx and kills everything with in reach then you get to see all the wonderful whine posts of i was not even out of warp and i got killed whyand as far as getting more people into lowsec you have to be kidding there is nothing in lowsec to get the people into the damn belts all you are doing is setting up a jb jewperhighway type network that makes the haulers as safe as they were in high secincrease the value of the belts and then maybe it would make some sense plus is you remember they buffed the guns already and reduced the shield recharge and resists on the ships
not supported in the slightestany support for this is simply based on variations of abovequoted individual yeah i modified the post a smidge alsolol thread
i support this but not for the reason specifiedi think that the guns probably do a fine job now but i think it would be good for eve to make it easier to travel somewhere in lowsec gatecamping is boring to those as do it and lame and frustrating to those that receive iti would rather encourage more people to get into lowsec where more interesting fights can happen at stations belts poses etcremember everyone traveling in lowsec is on their way somewhere i would prefer to push combat to that somewhere rather than on the gates and i think this would helpso signed
much better idea
there are no nonpvp areas in evetrade mining market your competing with other players noone player uses a gun another a wallet another a pick axe there is no difference really only some weapons of choice take more planningcunning than otherslogging into eve is consent to pvp chose your weapons wisely

how would this change modules in space that have no tower online or the tower has been popped pretty much no different is it the tactic of leaving trash at a moon to block a new tower has been used with great success for some groups
i suggested 30days to make it easier to implement mechanically since there is already a 30 day removal script in game i would assume it would be far easier for the devs to include offline pos in this instead of creating a whole new protocol to deal with towersof course i am no programer so i could be wrong that said though i think your 5 day is a bit to short  happens in rl and 5days can be too short a time to deal with rl drama sometimes
id say that anchoredofflined tower modules would get the same timer if they arent inside a towers shields shields go off modules go bye bye 30 days later
clean them up somehow

please no not aliens thats just too clichUFFFDthat aside i somewhat like the idea of explorable systems though i would rather like to see a few new regions build up this way where you could only see systems you had actually visited on the map but that would have to be thought through carefully as that has a lot of implications and mechanics that needs sorting
unless the location of the stargates is changed frequantly and widely they might as well be openly broadcasted as anyone who cares to know where the gates are will obtain the needed bookmarksif the location of the stargates changes frequently and widely then the logistics needed to function in those star systems will be impracticalwhat is the actual goal of these systems beyond sounding like a good idea on paper
i would think the fact that the new systems would be player discovered is the coolest part i think they should be broadcast after finding imagine corps racing to discover new systemstrying to keep their new find quiet only to be made known by other corps who also stumbled upon itthis is exactly the kind of late game adventures the salty old sailors would love
no aliens pleasea start at some of this stuff exists in exploration content i think hidden systems isnt such a good idea but hidden sites certainly is more varied and more interesting exploration plexes out on the very fringes of space sounds exciting though its just rather a pity its so annoying to run plexes a long way from home with the virtual requirement for two ships that exists currentlywtb probingbonused but not cloakingbonused t2 battlecruiser hull perfect for solo hunting and plexing alike truly something for everybodybut thats another thread general thumbs up for this on the condition that you remove the aliens bit

yeah youre right the game should be changed to suit your specific needs oh wait no it shouldnt not supported train an itty v or something
well it should its worth a try isnit how else do you think speeds got changed in the game nano nerf somebody brought it up once on the forums
even if you dont train an itty v and keep using the mastodon you can still fit that much just use a t2 expander rig its not impossible just expensive
true i could skill for itty 5 or get a t2 cargo rig 350m isk but thats not the point giving the mastodon 800m3 extra when fitted for max hauling isnt much but does allow to hold 2 bcs or 3 cruisers but like i said i rather see a new hauler something between a transporter and a freighter with 100k m3 or so
ccp is working on a small freighter class shipif you actually read the forums youd knew about it
actualy i have read about it but if the development time is about the time it takes to develop the orca 1 year in development and still no eta then we will see it in about 2 years
is there any chance of rockets ever being looked into they are extremely short range and low damage to boot even the ships with bonuses cant make that much use of them
they are low range but are high damage relativelyignoring all skills and bonuses and using purely tech i gearbloodclaw light missile does 75 kinetic damagestandard missile launcher i has a 15 second rate of fire75 damage over 15 seconds  5 dpsthorn rocket does 25 kinetic damagerocket launcher i has a 4 second rate of fire25 damage over 4 seconds  625 dpsas is common for missiles closer range is higher damage farther range is less the same parallelism applies to heavy assaults vs heavies and torps vs cruises in this case rockets are 25 more dpsyou can get fairly absurd dps out of a thorn rage rocket kestrel max skills with 4 launcher iis with two bcs iis gives you 160 sustained dpsplus with those rates of fire it looks pretty cool
now this one i will really support
seems that its already in development
supported
i agree with this man
i like this idea a lot actually add lows andor change the useless tanking bonus to a capacity bonusmuch better to recycle an underused ship class and skill than create a new one
agreedcurrent freighters are slow and take for ever to move from one place to another12 sized and 2x better mobility would have to be a different class of ship and not a t2 version of the haulertransporters asking for the ability to pick up jetted cargo is probably asking a bit much but i will anyway single high slot

good idea good call supported
hey look its already in development post your yays there
i am one of the people who are fond of faction cruisers me in person it is the looks and the history behind each of them my fav is the ashimmu but also the vigilant has a special placebut i think there must have been a error somewhere at sometimelets compare the thorax with the ashimmuthorax about a 1000pg 5 high 3 med 5low tech 1 cruiser one of my fav works like a charm and does its jobashimmu about 1000pg 7high 3 med 6low ehe wth 2 more high slots 1 more low and still a 1000pg and i really want to fit 3 nosneut there wich take 175pg each atm i fly one with 3 nos 4 wep 1 mwd 1 medium repper a normal setup i would say for a ship like this should fit easy but no i need two rcu ii to fit itthis is just one of the examples of the fact that they lack in fitting and some in bonusessome points1 faction cruisers remain tech 1 cruisers and therefore should not be better than a similar tech 2 counter part2 faction cruisers have some specialised roles and should have the room to for fill those3 a tech 2 cruiser is a improved version for a tech 1 counter part like the deimos is just a thorax with a ton of damage and like the thorax it has no tank fine with that but vigilant is a specialised version that is made to fly faster and to hit fastersmaller targets but it has trouble to do soa well i aitn a great one in these things but i would say it is clear these faction cruisers all of them save a few need a look at
bump
supportedyes please
i support this idea

i have been rather surprised that this was never implemented to start with it really should be there already
same thing happened to me a while backyou dont know your insurance has run out until you try and make a claim you cant even renew the policy early without loosing part of the insurance periodnotifications should be sent out as soon as the policy expires or slightly earlierchris
i was under the impression that the csm was formed after the t20 incident and one of their duties would be a type of oversight committee on ccp so that the players would not feel betrayed or cheated in such a manner i bring up this issue with that idea in mindtldr versiona daisho syndicate member was caught in an iskselleriskfarmer organizationhe alludes to account sharing but denies itsaid members account was banned and titan taken by ccphis friend claims that legal action is underwayi would like csm to do their investigatory role if they have one or for either ccp or the csm to give the players some closure on the matter im not lawyer not even an internet lawyer so ccp may not address an ongoing legal matter but maybe the csm can wiggle around that either way i want answers i want the truth
lastly i am not a daisho alt or whatever either ccp brings down the proofhammer on this guy or else we get drama from ccp either way i will get enjoyment out of this i like reading the posts by people claiming innocence and then ccp crushes them by confirming they are isk sellersi anxiously await more rofls dramas
the csm does not have an investigatory role  theyre an advisory council not forensic auditors
theres actually a video on you tube of the leaders of daisho in a hot tub smoking crack with britany spears amy winehouse and three unnamed thirdworld isk sellers you can actually hear one of them saying heres your thousand dollars dude flying that titan is going to be soooo awesome hang on ill try to find the link for you
if there really was a lawsuit they would at least be able to say which court it was filed with maybe even give some way to reference their specific casefrom those links in the op i gathered the following  someone takes isk from an account that isnt his  he gets banned for it and for looking like an isk seller and we only have his word that he didnt buy it  he had a titan on that account which was lost because of his stupidity  makes noise about a lawsuit but doesnt give any informationso unless he proves that a lawsuit exists the matter looks closed to me as proof goes ill settle for a scan of the document the court gave him to confirm that the lawsuit was filed with confidential information like his name address and phone number blanked out
please leave the drama in caod or eve general at worst i want no part of it
yet this is the precise thing that the csm was advertised as being an insight into the internal workings of ccp for the players in the wake of the t20 incident and the drama caused by it the fact that the csm is now nothing but an advisory council on new changes which tbh they have no buisness advising about as the small number of ppl on the csm council can never properly represent the opinions of several thousand and from the looks of many of their posts far too many of them are guided by their own personal agendas over what the players really feel is warranted so you have in effect brought the drama from caod yourself by stating that the csm is something other than what it was supposed to be
come on this was a funny troll but were not really taking it seriously are welets use our brains for a second here under what conditions does ccp as a matter of course take assets andor isk away under what conditions do they ban accountsin the first case its because you bought isk rightin the second case its because you sold iskplayer a gets 40 billion isk from player b whose alliance has been collecting it as rent player b turns around and gives it to his alliance who buys a titan with itccp sees an unusual inexplicable transfer of 40 billion isk follows the money back to its origins and hmmmm what have we here isk sellers looks like both player a and player b are wholesalers who brokered a large isk purchase by an alliance doesnt itof course player a says that player b is a friend of his who just gave him the isk for no good reason ill bet in 5 years thats the first time ccp has ever heard that from an isk buyerseller you have to understand that ccp can never see the money side of an isk for money transaction all they can see is isk moving around for no good reason when they see that they look at the accounts involved to see if there is a pattern of it when they find that there is they1 remove the iskassets from the buyer2 ban accounts that look to be in the seller chainwhich from the look of it is exactly what they did here moral of the story boys and girls is that if you get caught with your paws on 40 billion isk that came from isk sellers youd better have a better excuse for how you got it than my friend gave it to meare we done with this now
even giving them the largest powers ccp could allow them to audit a employee activity not a audit of player activitythere are several privacy law that will make that illegal and in game considerations seeing as most of the csm members are part of some alliance to make that unwise
even if the csm has an accountability role that would only kick in if youre suggesting that ccp is corrupt in this instance and i dont think anybody on either side is alleging that im sure those who have been banned are alleging incompetence but i wouldnt think theyre saying things like ccp just banned us because the gm responsible for bannings lost a ship to my titan furthermore if 9 cant represent 250k effectively how the hell can 435 represent 300 million i admit its probably a stretch to call congress effective but the point stands also whats wrong with people being guided by their personal agendas as long as theyre open about those agendas during the election and from what i recall they all were then thats what theyre supposed to do jade for example got elected primarily on his vision of a different kind of 00 combat whether you think those changes are good or not a plurality of eve players liked them and elected him to represent them and their favour towards those opinions if he didnt follow through and attempt to advance those ideas hed be betraying everybody who voted for him this is the whole point of electing representatives  you campaign on how youre going to act in representing your constituents and ideally speaking are an honest enough fellow to actually act that way after being elected its the only way voters can make a sensible decision
would be nice for the cmss to ask ccp to put the incident to bed however frankly dashi lost all right when they started taking money off farmers especially if it was for rent but i dont know the full story  but that activity is even worse than buying isk your actaully helping the folks that have bought isk
so who did you vote for i voted for steel and he is doing a fine job by my accountif a democracy like this is supposed to work people need to be invested in the election process and actually vote for someone they think can represent them wellif your representative aint doing a bang job vote differently next timeedited for clairity
ccp is worse than  got it
i just want to clarify something herecsm did meet with ccps internal affairs team while were were in icelandwe had a presentation from them and then we had a qa sessionseveral members of the csm took the opportunity to ask very probing questions and we got very honest and straightforward answersfrom my perspective ccp have put their house in order post the whole t20 scandal and everyone in the company is now highly aware of the consequences of their ingame actions indead some staff members i talked to during our trip do not even play eve anymore because they feel too much pressure moderating their ingame actionsthe internal affairs team are consulted regularly by ccp employees regarding their action ingame and what doesdoes not cross the line and are now expected to play the game with a higher code of ethics than the majority of normal players doin addition to providing ccp players with advice on what is an isnt acceptable in game the internal affairs team also conducts its own checks on the ingame activities of staff members accountsips i am not going into detail on how these checks are conducted  we were sworn to secrecy  but to my albeit nontechie viewpoint they seemed fairly comprehensivewhile i will not guarantee that a new t20 episode or similar will not happen again sometimes people do stupid things i am a lot more confident that the chances have been significantly minimised  certainly no staff member seems unaware of the potential consequencesi would go as far to say that from what we were told about the policies and systems put in place postt20 that ccps model would be an example of best practice in the mmo industry  but as i have not had an insight into how other mmo operators maybe i am wronganyway in summation while csm is more focused on game development issues and providing ccp with player feedbackresponsefeelings we have not totally abandoned our oversight rolehowever with regard to the specific incidents that prompted this thread i will not comment at this stage as the dust hasnt settled as yet
supported this makes no sensetangentially i would also like to know why capship chas take so much longer to load than any other kind of hangar in the game despite holding far fewer items
that is the point people will then have to assume that its hidden for a reason which it can be or its just a decoy for the real transport coming in another shipping suiciding being a risk free occupation i have no love for the cargo scanner
kinda related but there are simmilar issues if you have locked bpos in a corp hanger and the office is unrented due to not paying getting the bpos back took a petition but for some bpos multiple days of downtime can cost you some serious isk
bpos going missing seem to be a common bug why is that
just because t2 bpos were once given out in the lottery doesnt mean everyone sourced them that way i have paid hard earned cash for mine ccp removingmodifying them without at least a years notice would be extremely annoyingor using a different analogylets remove the mexallon people purchased at 8 isk two years ago obviously the new characters never got to buy the mexallon that cheap so the old ones shouldnt get to hold onto itt2 bpos when purchased are an investment just like purchasing a pile of minerals to hold for resale some time in the future remove our t2 bpo investment and you can also remove every other investment others have made in the pastremove t2 bpos that were dropped in a lottery to the players who still hold them sure nah but really everyone has the ability to choose their purchases in this game t2 bpos are becomming scarcer and scarcer as you watch the wts forums you see less and less for sale they are getting blown up often or people are holding onto them leaving eve etcinvention easily fixes the balancing issues that once existed i would say in some cases invention goes too far as i watch some items literally dont profit at all for the t2 bpo owner you actually lose money by producing them this wouldnt be a fault of invention moreso stupid inventors who have no idea how to determine their inventbuild coststhere arent many items left that make big profit and all of them have artificial caps invention to stop things getting out of hand 13m cap recharger ii anyoneeveryone has the ability to purchase a t2 bpo if and when they want they just need to save up and work for it like i and many many others did
the goons seek to open up the t2 issue so they can spend the billions of isk they got from farmers and ripping off of the general populace
there is an old idea that ccp could use here if they want to do something about the issue its a preinvention ideaas with any fundimental change to t2 bpos it should be delayed at least a year after it is announce even thought its effect will be gradualits a simple ideaeach month npcs will use the contract system to auction one copy and only one copy of each t2 bpo some will stay expensive forever at that rate but at least they will be available for anyone to bid on would also be a nice little isk sink which the game needs more of and yes as the isk would be paid to npcs it would be a real isk sink
i would kinda be ok with that last suggestion regarding the auction or at least i would consider it a fair compromise and i have always been in agreeance that more isk sinks are needed
what no this is a horrible idea
posting in a brilliant troll thread
is this the forum asian face v
certain memebers need to stop pushing their own agendas repeatedly at meetings i keep seeing some of the members trying to push forward the same idea just reworded every other meeting while i understand they may think that what they think is important is the most important this is not always the case to the player base as a wholeseriously some of you delegates need to be a little less self centered and actually pay attention to the constituency as a whole not just the part you personally agree withi also think that there needs to be something done with post in the assembly area that really belong in the features and ideas i realise there is a fine line sometimes between assembly hall and f  i post but sometimes it is just so obvious that people are posting in the assembly hall when it should be in fi first to me fi is where ideas get started feedback generated changes accomadated and then if there seems to be a general consenus it should be brought to the assembly hall if devs failed to acknowledge it in fii do like the idea of no real live meetings and a delegates only forum with public view although particapation would have to be recorded for historical purposes since some of the delegates are less forum whoring than others
part of the problem regarding the 7 day rule isnt the rule itself its the simple fact that as the csm have stated in the past they only have three opportunities per term to present issues to ccp and ccp have mandated that the submission templates need to be with them a set period of time prior to their meetings or else the issue wont even be officially looked at this happened with a couple of the issues at the iceland meeting where the vote was performed in plenty of time but the template document was accidentally left out of the submission to ccp for the agendano ifs no buts miss the deadline and the issue doesnt go on the table until the following meeting which could end up being 23 months down the roadthere has to be some degree of flexibility in how issues get from us to the csm and then from the csm to ccp otherwise we just bog the process down in pointless bureaucracy and nothing gets achieved as a resulthaving said that the 7 day rule is in the csm vision document along with such promises asto further support the introduction of ideas from society members a forum mechanism will be introduced which allows topics to be marked for resolution ensuring that the matter is brought before the csm  using their own judgment representatives will have the power to mark topics as they deem necessary namely by gauging which issues voters are generating the most debate about once a topic is marked voters will be able to indicate their support or disapproval anonymously just as with the general election the system will also prevent individuals from voting more than once on the topicthe underlined sections indicating issues that have been raised due to these features not being implemented correctly at the moment you need to stick to the 7 day rule however theres nothing stopping you from debating and possibly changing the rule in future if it becomes an obstacle to the smooth running of the csm at the moment ccp have provided you with certain shackles for example the requirement to hold live meetings via the in game chat and next to no guidance in what you can or cant doyou need to decide for yourself what boundaries are necessary and which ones need to be pushed back to do that however ccp need to be taking a much more active role with the csm than 3 meetings a term they need to be dealing with the csm on a daily basis if need be if only to ensure a smooth transision to the next csm when the current term ends
basically you need a chribbaa third party nonvoting member to run the meetings and organize the flowi think that the current csm did a fine job seeing how there was no organization or flow from the first day all those competing personalities would make it tough on anyone
heres a thought   make it so that it costs a bit of isk to post a new topic or even to post in an existing one1 less poststopics  ccp wastes less time moderating and can spend more doing whatever else they could be doing2 trolls flamers griefers myself and whateverelsers might think twice about writing something that really isnt all that productive3 posts would have more of a chance of having been well thought out4 all that transferred isk could be used simply for ingame economic inflation prevention or for something creative like towards rl charities as was mentioned in another post somewhere around herewhat do you thinkno you cant have my stuff and yes i was brave enough to post with my main i know i asked for it    the title alone is a flamemagnet so just assume that having spread this idea that ive done what i set out to do and wont let you vicious vicious people hurt my feelings thanks for readingloedited for grammar
while i am still against nerfing local this is the best proposal for an alternative that i have seen so far not just remove localit is interesting but seems like a lot more work which might not actually be a bad thing if these was actually implemented it would certainly change the way a mining op is runbut i still see it favoring pirates and other criminals i still would like to know who is enteringleaving the system more importantly what their standing is to memy corpab
aiden it is obvious that this solution would need to do reverse standing lookups if you go to a sysetm with low scanning level and the system is only supposed to show the names of the friendlies its not their standing towards you that matters not the standing you have set towards them or you could just put everyone to 10 and see it all
im guessing you didnt read the part where i was asking a csm rep to comment on the status of this issue  basically the time for debate is over  were already 9 pages into it and it has run its course for the johnny come latelys  you missed the bus  you shoulda piped in before it was decided to bring it to ccp by the csm over 2 months agobut if you still insist on dragging out the discussion  please go to page 1 and read the original post before you make a comment showing your complete ingnorance of the exact topic being discussed
or else youll war dec me grow upi read your post as i said in my post it looks like its counter to what the devs have in mind for war decs already and probably has a snoballs chance in hell of being prioritized ahead of other changes that they want to make to them my feedback therefore is that bringing it to them at this time is a waste of csm bandwidth its fine if you dont like my feedback but posturing like im an ignorant ass who didnt read your post just because you dont like my feedback only makes you look like one thanks for your reply
how about coding something that does not allow npc corp pilots to loot any pc wreck that they are not on the killmail for or any npc wreck that they did not contribute damage to this would solve a few issuesdont know if this is possible but it is an idea that i have not seen mentioned in my scanningslade

a simple way to deal with this while not allowing storyline farming in the way described above would berun a regular encounter mission as a gang  all members of the gang who entered the final room of the encounter grid before the mission shows as being completed get one mission towards the storyline requirement a mission cannot be handed in as complete unless the mission holder was present in the grid when the mission is shown as complete this eliminates the possibility of one high standing character taking a gang out to a mission site then returning to sit safe in station while his gang completes the missionno gang completion for courier missions this way the only ways to gain missions towards the threshold when youre not the mission holder is to either gang up on kill missions or mining missions both of which should take a reasonable amount of time to complete and have a reasonable amount of risk involved per mission in comparision to courier missionsonce a gang member reaches the threshold a storyline agent of the appropriate faction will contact him to offer him a storyline mission this works exactly like a standard storyline mission ie only the person getting the mission gets the standings increase

i support this idea sort of like an eft for skills
this should have been done years agoskills should take 110 sec per level any level any rank to train on sisiwith this simple change any player could test any change that ccp madethier feedback would skyrocket and their testing potential would rise with itand how would impact the game it wouldnt at all it sisi it has no direct impact on tqget it done ccp
i think you need to find a balace for it toughyou dont want 110 seconds training time as people will just stop playing on the main server thenyou could limit it to 25 m extra sp or something it could also be a great tool for people to find out for wich ship they should train as it takes incredibly long and you want to make the right choiceso its a test for both ccp and yourself edit  ohnoes forgot support
signed
agreed this could be an issue if ccp didnt take simple precautions like say sisi resets to what your character is on tq every dt that way no matter what you do you dont get to keep it from day to day and you have to start over training what you would like to test from day to dayalso i agree that 110 sec is a little extreme i prolly should have gone with like 12 minscheers
ccp is going to give some lame excuse not to do this but i support it anyway
would be a huge gain of time supported
this makes sense to me something i thought myself might work
almost two thousand replies to this threadwill be interesting to see if ccp even notice
i support the nano nerf
it appears all is not lost this issue even got a dev response in a different thread o
i have no colour handicap yet i have an absolutely awful time telling which of my icons are glowing green on most backgrounds that besides space just feels too damn bright it may be a bit premature asking for this right now in light of the fact that celestials are getting revamped in the distant future in accordance with the direct x 9c upgrades unless what ive been hearing is just hearsay edit thanks to the post above mine for an official statementill mark my support for this but my biggest hope is that ccp reduces the artsy  in the background when they redo the nebulae for trinity gfx

i just thought of a wonderfull side effect of this no more jita local spamming once again great idea this is well thought out and has plenty of room for balancing and adds an extra objective for 00 warfare
i like the idea of generating the intel from another source then the local chat channel
great idea the ability to actually see a balance sheet on a personal project without having all the other crud mixed in would be great

should have the abiliy to scoopjettison anywhere this is something freighters cant do and so gives it a rolecapital tractor is a good touch makes it the hauler of choice for empire mining ops or smallgang 00 opsable to fit a tankcloak  bad juju unless its hold is really small sub 50k if you make a smaller ship that can tank better than a freighter and cloak and carry multiple battleships or equivelent youll pretty much obsolete freighters nobody is going to haul more and be a gank target when they could haul a little less and be relatively safe id just ask that you take the economics of a highsec suicide gank into consideration when you do your designedit i too support the notion of a black ops logistic ship but i dont think this ship should be it that ship should be a third t2 industrial to go along with the dst and the blockade runner that should have dst capacity and stealth bomber like bonus to cloaked speed so that it doesnt become an albatross around the blackops gangs neck providing a stealthy ship of this size is a little over the top
newbies indeed as a solo player i still fly my badger ii all the time with a cloakingecmmini tank cheaper and more fun than the t2 variant  for the same money you could finance a small escort fleet the additional cargo space isnt outstanding this id be happy with a rokh model with a rusty old industrial texture should be just big enough to carry one packaged battleship natively and punch around the level of a small battlecruiser this would reflect the actual history of merchant marine ships during wartimei hate mining but am jealous of the interesting ship selections available to miners on the other hand i actually like hauling from a roleplaying pov right now the farther you progress with it the worse it gets your risks and costs go way up while your ships can do less and less you might as well just sit in station and issue courier contracts
maybe just disallow large ships in npc corps or have it that npc corps tax mineral sales or whatever their specialty is the way player corps typically tax bounties and mission rewards you work for a big corp in the real world you get regular pay and benefits in return for which they keep 80 of your productivity in eve you are secure from war declarations but your socalled employer lets you make as much money as you want on the side
oh i absolutely agree that lo sec should be more profitable than hisec and 00 should be more profitable than losec although not by nearly as high a margin im just saying that missioning outside concord protection isnt the instant death sentence that many missioneers assume it to be in fact the actual process of doing a mission is significantly safer than belt ratting the risk come from the fact that youre tied to a station now where 1 pirate hunts 1 missioner thats a significant risk where the missioners outnumber the pirates 101 it really neednt be even mission fits  pvp fits with a 101 numerical advantage
not just yes but hell yes
i think this whole thing boils down to a carrot vs a stick approach to getting people to move out to lowno secccp has always and i hope always will used the carrot approach to getting people to move out to lowno sec this approach is balanced fair and lets people feel they have control over their characters and their gaming destiny which after all is one of the major good points of evethe op by contrast wants to use the stick and force people out to lowno sec if they want to continue with a mission running career beyond level 2s this approach is extremely limiting economically dangerous and forces players to take actions and get involved with playstyles that they may or may not want to dothe ops approach to this perceived problem will be bad for eve in that it will limit player base expansion there is no way around this fact people who pay for the game because they like running missions will not like being forced to pvp and they will quit or not try eve at all in the first place because of itif the op is so convinced that level 4 missions are so bad why doesnt he and his goon friends do something about it jyhadswarm made gs lots of friends  why not a swarm of mission disrupters this is perfectly within the rules and lots of people do it loot flipping mission critical loot extortion fleet baiting etc all of these activities are perfectly within the rules and very real dangers that any high level mission runner faces especially the ones in high sec that you are so on about also none of the listed activities automatically cost you your ship and you can do them to people whether or not they are in a noobcorpmy point is that if the op and what is obviously a significant portion of his alliance by the number of people in goon posting to this thread feel there is a problem with level four missions and how profitable they are they should do something about it in the true spirit of eve not simply whine about it in the forumsyou think that level 4s in high sec are too safe fine make them less so goon has the numbers ccp has given you the exploitable rule tools to do it so whats the problem too lazy i guessso in summary for the reasons that i have listed i offer this thread less than no support because no one should be granted a rule change when there is already a perfectly balanced system in place and because they are too lazy to fix the perceived problem themselves when it is well within their power to do so
ok so let me get this straightthere are two groups of players involved in this discussionthe first group of players has built their characters correctly matched their own personal skills with those characters and become good at earning isk through certain activities in high secthe second group of players has built their characters perhaps incorrectly mismatched their own personal skills with those characters and therefore suck at earning isk through any activities in lowno secthe second group is angry with the first group and envious of their success so the second group demands a system change of all the mechanics of how the first group makes isk and wants them moved to where they the second group live in spite of the fact that the second group already has these mechanics available to them where they live therefore they just dont want the first group to have access to them at all anymore where the first group livesuhm yeah no supportjust because you suck at how you choose to play the game is no reason to make the game harder less appealing for othersgrow a pair there is tons of isk to be made in lowno sec already much more than in empire i make billions profit of isk weekly in lowno sec solo i might add just because you dont know how to do it is no excuse to take it out on otherslook around find opportunities to improve your own playing habits before you put a damper on others
the main problem as i see it is that if the level 4s were moved to low sec systems these systems and the few surrounding them to which missioneers may be sent instantly become the new pirate meccas of eve now thats a boon for pirates but really unless missions are flipped around so that they are more doable in pvp kit i seriously doubt you would have many mission runners taking the proposed bait mission runners are as a group extremely risk averse generally and theyd simply find something else to do or leave eve a suggestion i have seen pointed out in the main forums seems more sensible cap the number of missions that can be run by any account from one dt to the next dt that caps the money generation issue in a fairly unintrusive way
a large amount of eve players enjoys doing missions in empire let them have their funsure you have chinese mission running macro metagamming alts that farm the crap out of thembut most people just want to have funaltough giving away more iskies in lowsec00 would be greatand to be fair  most people that tick the support box just want to grief them if you move all the level 3 and 4 missions to pvp grounds your going to have at least 10 pirates in cov ops probing every single one out and then just get 10 people in bs kill the poor fellow
00 is more profitable atm than highseclowsec is a bit more profitable than highsec00 is just as safe as highsec sometime even much safer if u not in a npc corp in highsec if u get wardec u have much harder to watch if enemies around or if someone probed u and warped in fast ship to u in laggy systems like most of the lvl4 agent empire systemsi live long ago in 00 and is very very safe i can rat the whole day and i need just go to warp between ss or grab pvp ship if enemy comes to the system which is very rear if u not on a pipe or in station systemif u can get peoples out of npc corp than the problem is resolved just let use lvl45 agents if u not in npc corp and done
i think the rewards are ok voor highsec missions what is wrong is the eve economy at large problem is the static prices within eve players get for doing something or not like surviving d first of all the insurance this mechanism puts a minimum price on ships for example if the insurance costs 10m and the payout is 50m then you will never see the ship below 60m on the market same is true on mission running and npc buying produces goods for a fixed pricea simple solution does not exists lower one thing like reward on mission running means people have less isk to spend which will drop the prices which will trigger a lower income for miners i think the sole reason for ccp to hire an economist is to evaluate the current situation and come up with a solutionif i think about it the only real solution is to remove the objects that insert isk into eve and the object that remove isk from eve but that would mean for example free skills the skills that can be bought from npc no more bounties on rats no more insurance payouts etc it would be so dramatic that eve would not be the same anymore i am curious what ccp is going to do about the current situation
this is the most interesting proposal i read in a while and deserve its own thread suggested title small changes to remove most glaring mission abuse also dont forget the respawned mission roids some people farm missions for the decent ore
okay youre an optimistthe biggest difficulty lies not in how you operate your mission but your ship fits and yes most pirates are going to get their kills close to 100 of the time if they dont think they will they wont engagejumping mission runners will always be advantage pirate just as jumping ratters in nosec is always advantage raider tactically not strategically the only reason that the raiders arent better off is because of the nbsi polices most null secs run when a neut or red with a good chance of messing folks up comes into the system the ratters either dock up pos up cloak up or gang up in about that order they simply refuse combat that doesnt work in low seceven so if the raider scans out someone alone and ratting that ship will likely die unless its good or planned as bait even then the raider will often get away due to the attention of the ratsas long as pvp fits and pve fits are required to be so different to be successful the ops idea is a poor one its just a nerf to high sec and a buff to 00 system owners it wont even help the low sec pirates much unless they start mission runningthe idea as things are is a nonstarter and a poor idea from the lets hate the highsec types and ccp will never do it as things standthat said the idea of putting the higher l missions out toward the borders does make sense from a storyline perspective not all borders are all lowsec though theres no question that lowsec needs a dramatic boost but this isnt the way to do it 00 probably doesnt need a big boost i know that i no longer mission run as it cant compare to the isk of 00 ratting for isk per hour i do my grinding out in null sec now it pays better and its more interesting
point 1  when 1 pirate pvp fit ship hunts a solo missioner pve fit and probably already ground down somewhat by rats the pirate wins unless he or she is a total moron and not just most of the timepoint 2  economics if you solo a l4 in empire and make 10 million isk in pay and bounties which is a bit high for most l4s iirc you make all of that plus what you loot and salvage if it takes ten of you to do the same run in low sec you each make 110th as much collecting the loot and salvage is harder due to the presence of unfriendlies so its harder to pick up that additional lucre as well not impossible but more difficult i do it in null sec but its not the same and i dontcant do it as reliablyso  in order to break even on just the economic basis you have to make missions worth well over ten times as much and thats to break even if you really want people to want to be there which is whats required for real economic diversification it would have to be even moretaken out of context what you say makes sense put it in the context of the reason most people do this activity and it makes far more sense to stay in high sec and run l2s without the rewards being many orders of magnitude higher
examples no clear way of telling how plexing efforts are goingmissions are way too hard and do not count towards capturing systems so no real reward for doing them over normal npc missionsthe difference between minor outposts majors uncontested etc is nonexistent all you need is two ships to take any plexpossible solutions that could refocus are quite obviousmake plex sizes dependent on plexing efforts minors then cruiser level then bc level then majors then major uncontesteds if you plex long enough the level of plexes increaseswhy would the enemy faction reinforce a system with a major plex if the system is no where close to falling plexing should scale all the way up to the point that you defeat the faction npcs and they have to call in the pod militia as a last defense of the systemmake missions that are hard stay hard but actually help capture the system significantly a level four mission in enemy territory that has strategic importance like the agents say should do something not just be a crappy missionto sum up make missions count towards system vps make plexes have an order to clear up how close to capturing a system is and all of these things lead up to a last ditch effort by the factions to call in militia to capturedefend the system
is this on the table recent playing around with minmatarr ships have proven arti to still suck xd
some more power for the chat would be nice
this is a horrible idea almost all the commands that have been suggested so can be manipulated to help isk sellers macro miners and who knows what elseconv  great lets make it even easier to spam chat channels by both isk sellers and the general playersevemail  see abovedestination  combined with hotkeys to turn on automatic pilot nice to reduce the actual human interaction required for empire macrominers etcif any of these were were implemented there would have to be some kind of very careful monitoring to make sure they are not abused in any number of ways
youll find voices on the other side of this argument who know how hard it is to fund war efforts and keep churning out enough capitals and t2 gear to satiate the ship grinder that is 00 sov warfare theyll argue that any hit to 00 profitability will seriously hinder the ability of 00 alliances to stand on any firm footing compared to losec alliances who enjoy the lack of as much exposure of assetsright now taking moon mining offline requires sieging a pos if the modules are more vulnerable there will be more disruptions more disruptions means less t2 gear and probably some inflation surrounding that t2 supplyless stuff in circulation means less t2 stuff getting chopped up and less pilots who are flying it over all less of any resource production like moon mining equates to less junk for us to play with if anything im for much much increased supply of junkwith the sov tools focusing a bit more on fleet mobility and leaving more opportunities for dividing and zerg rushing a pinned deployment from the main force i believe well see a natural balance to contextcreep that would normally accelerate in a bolstered production environment therefore if anything id like to see boosted 00 productivity accompanying these newer more effective tools of sov
welpi wouldnt bump it again if any csm rep was going to reply they would have by now doesnt look like well be able to get much feedback 00 threads in general havent seen many responses since kelsins first thread kind of a mixed blessing i guess at least things arent getting worse
i understand the implications of making moon mining more interruptable would break the current way alliances are controlling space that being said i think that is part of the whole ccp idealess capital shipsmy hope is that your proposal would decrease the s of caps in fights no more 500 man cap blobs floating aboutlike i pointed out earlier thoughkeep iskies where they are now and just adjust them later if it becomes an issue its not that im opposed to changing the isk rate of moon miningits just that i want to see the need first

well ccp definitely wouldnt implement a boost to 00 income that was unbalanced  this proposal just makes sure to point out that income will definitely be impacted by the vulnerabilities of raiding and says that as part of that change ccp will have to take a look at base income levels to balance that out which i think is a very fair request
hmmm sorry  didnt realise about not posting gm mailsa terrible idea irl the big ships would have pilots flying fighters and salvage missions for you in eve drone tech replaces the human element for a lot of things  the same way that irl robots have replaced humans in car factories you still need a humanpod pilot to organise them
had them once and they got rid of them doubt they will be backeverslade
why did they get rid
horrible a ship at the cost of drone bandwidth and drone space will have an alternative to tractor and salvager good for example for big pvp battles where people often dont deploy drones after the battle if you are the victor you could use the drones to salvageto avoid having 2 modules in 1 package the best option would be mediumheavy hauler drones moving the wreck toward the ship and small salvage drone only salvaging the ship and with limited cargo space 1 m3 would be more than sufficent for most ships if scrapmetal was removed from teh salvage tables
they were never deployed the skill was available for a short period doing one of thw training missions then it was removed
ive seen threads calling for these before and i think theyd be awesome every timedrones all have a listed cargo capacity but only miners take advantage of it it would be great if drones could loot for you after the fight but having specific drones that salvage for you would be great tooi could be flying a mission domi with 3 tractor3 salvager or guns and an extra wing of salvage drones instead
well if that doesnt deserve a thumbs up i dont know what does
and yet they complain that theres no one in low sec for them to hunt jeez at least be consistentbut i agree that the guns should be brought in line with todays ships
how about a button to save selected messages onto harddrive
agreedbut lets not stop there lets actually make a proper mail client
even if everything is related to pvp doesnt mean they cant discuss mining as mining for ore is one of the primary resources for the pvpers in some way ammo moduels weapons and ships are all built from minerals so improving that would be a big boost to us miners as well as the pvpers the talk about changing loot tables soverignity and nanos doesnt do much for the nonpvpers which are the people that pvpers rely upon to keep them going

i support this idea 
well yeah ill give you that  things come to those who wait  yeah right
kestrel is a bit of an exception because of the double bonus overall though rockets should be increased in damage i think the standard launcher could use a slight boost as well to be honest overall frigate sized launchers are rather weakheavy launcher has a faster rof than the standard launcher go figure
i think all afs should have a minimum of 100 dps even the tanking ones
newsflash overall all missile system are kinda weak its the tradeoff you get for using a weapons system thatsimmune to tracking disruptinguses no caphas no tracking to deal withis relatively unaffected by targets speed unless target breaks about 3kmsis completely unaffected by users speedis fairly longrange compared to most turretsand probably a few more point im forgettingtradeoffs you do lower dps you can defendered missiles can be outrun and theyre not instant dps
if we are thinking standards as long range and rockets as short range frigate weaponry talking about extremely short range is rather funny especially when we take into consideration that missiles are actually quite damn effective in mind they are the most easytouse weapon system ie most versatilehmm there must be some reason why crow is 23 times more worth than other ceptors maybe its the speed looks pherhaps
the ships i noticed this on in particular was the heretic and vengeance it seems the coercer has more damage potential than the heretic
yeahi think something needs to be done its a bit messed up at the moment i have been in fleets forming up and a corp jumps in and wipes out a couple of the fleet the rest of us cant do anything or we get concordedit makes fw less attractive in general which is a shame because fw gives people a chance for great fights without all the bull that goes with being in a player alliance
at a minimum id like the mechanics looked at as well
this issue has been heard by the council and rejected 18 as i recall  for the record i was the 1 the other csm delegates didnt feel there is an issue with this
well that sucks so it goes i guessedit im blind found the discussion
 onwards
the more votes the better100 support
edited because i hadnt seen thissounds like exactly what eve needs also all freighters should selfdestruct due an overlooked fundamental design flaw and the manufacturers should pay back the cost to owners as part of an interstellar class action suit freighters are a lousy reward for the effort that goes into acquiring them
youre assuming that low slot uses grid you stick an rcu in there and use the extra pg to fit your 2 spare highs with neuts along with switching the 5th gun the thorax gets for a neut as well think about it that way and the thorax gets 820 base grid for 535 and the ashimmu gets 9775 base grid for 735 given that a neut uses significantly less pg than a heavy medium gun it seems about right even after you consider that pulses use a touch more than blasters i agree with your overall design objectives for faction ships and id even agree that the blood raider ones need some work  theyre all over the place at presentsimilarly the guristas ones need an overhaul too though the other three factions are just fine but on that one specific paired ship comparison im not really convinced
ok this is the only time i will ever say this about any shipfaction cruisers need more fitting roomthats all
whats wrong with predation beating on other players are what eves nonconsensual pvp system is founded on and driven bygo play another game if you dont consent to pvp by logging inpvp flags lolwhat utter tripe
i think this is a fake post am i right
predation wheres chris hansen when you need himgo ahead and have a seat over there according to these logs you wanted this carebear to have pvp relations with youno no i just wanted to do missions with him reallythen why did you send him a link to your warp disruptorthat was just a mistake reallyand you brought ecm with youpathetic crying im soo sorry please forgive me
write out what the purpose of the csm is in a thread and sticky it at the top of the assembly hall include in that thread aspects of the game the csm willwill not look into a list of what topics have already been covered with links to the relevant meetingsecondly id suggest you review a way to insure that the range of issues raised is moreholistic
i like the sticky idea im not convinced on holism though  a lot of the stuff being brought up at this point even after the first two batches are completethough its slowing down are longstanding concerns being brought under the umbrella of the new system to address those concerns i agree a more holistic viewpoint of issues would be good and its something id like to see come from the next iteration of the csm but im not surprised it hasnt really come from the inaugural council there have been some examples of people trying to address multiple issues at once  the one that comes to mind is the group of recent threads on 00 changes attempting to address pos overuse fleet lag and insufficient detailstrategic depth in 00 systems all at once but most of them are just simple oneoff issues for example holism in an approach to the user interface would be nice but people are just going to bring forward threads about the one issue thats bugging them this week you generally have to find somebody passionate about an entire set of issues who is willing to bring it forward as a package deal because the csm cant just turn a thread on basketweaving into a submission about the role of wicker in the premodern economy there have been some examples of that approach as well  banes failed attempts to address the role of carriers dierdras successful attempts to overhaul highsec pvp options and the like  but overall theres only so much the csm can do i have a couple threads brewing about issues i find important though theyre not fit to be posted yet and im sure there are some waiting in the wings from others but the bulk of what lands at the csms feet is going to be disjointed highly reductionistic and not really get anything anywhere in the long run just the nature of the mechanisms used and this is why we keep a council around to sort out the dreck before ccp has to look at it
i already pay for forum posting rights and i pay in hard currency its called my monthly subscription feei have lots of isk does that mean i get to post as much trash as i like whereas poor players with great ideas but no isk wont post their great ideassome of the worst trolls on this forum are old players presumably they have more than enough isk to troll as much as they likeyour suggestion doesnt solve anything but creates more problemsa better idea is to have the existing rules enforced by ccp on a more consistent basis like they promised to do when they axed the volunteer moderators and brought in paid moderatorslol
an interesting proposal but a really bad one youd either set it high enough that newbies cant post or low enough that vets dont care and in either case i dont like limiting your ability to contribute to the useful parts of the forum just because your character is broke
i just thought of a wonderfull side effect of this no more jita local spamming once again great idea this is well thought out and has plenty of room for balancing and adds an extra objective for 00 warfare

though i enjoy taking my time to fit a new ship p it is a good idea
yo
i liked diamonds idea of taking damage once a ship goes past a certain speed so long as the speed caps are reasonable and still give the option of speed tankingi loath the day in eve where my only option is to throw plates or extenders on my ship and hope our blob is bigger than the hostiles
this  imagine how many chinese farmers would die in the first week  lol ccp are against selling isk online anywayand omfg this is an awesome and well thought out ideaim getting tingles thinking about it a lone pilot spends his day off in a dead end 01 system without being hassled then all of a sudden a rapier uncloaks next to him imagine the shock d its how it f should beoh im mining at a belt deep deep in no mans land but its ok i will know soon as someone enters the same solar system ie millions and millions of kilometers wide as me
anyone who disagrees with making this happen is just soft and probobly cries when they get ganked
i like this idea i think would bring a whole knew level to compation for control of a system and because of thatthumbs up
its certainly worth pushing in front of ccp to see what they think imo
nano fits r too strongmissile ships r too poor
nerf it about time
300 k would be a bit above the top indeed i imagine something in the ballpark of 100 k would be adequate if it would have reasonable agility advantage over regular freighter
it seems the thread is divided roughly into those who want a slightly bigger industrial ship and those who want a slightly bigger industrial ship will all the tractor bells and jump whistles attachedi propose a new class heavy industrialits t1 incarnation would just be a miniature freighter with enough cargo space to hold a couple of general freight containersit would then have two t2 options deep space logistics or jumpbridge transportdeep space logistics would allow interaction with cans mounting of capital tractor beams and other equipment eg for tanking the tradeoff being that the additional power grid and cpu requirements means that cargo capacity is cut by perhaps halfjumpbridge transport would be analogous to an airbridge and  as the name suggests  would install a jump drive into the ship to allow it to pass through blockades again cargo space would be halved to account for the increased systems requirementskillwise theres no reason why freighters should have anything to do with this heavy industrial could or should be a skill dependent on industrial perhaps requiring industrial 4 but advanced spaceship command 1the t1 variant is just a big ship so we should be forgiving when it comes to skills but the t2 variants should require quite a few level fives besides heavy industrial 5 obviously
i propose 2 teirs tier 1 has maybe 5km3 cargo and enough ship maintenance to haul any rigged sub cap ship because moving a rigged ship around in empire if you cant fly it is near impossibleteir 2 has bonus to fitting cap tractor beam and 1 high slot you can cloak or tractor not both give it 45 lows and a base of 30km3 or 2 lows and a base of 80km3 and say cargo rigs cant work on it enough mids for about 200k ehp might be too much but should take prolly 23 bs to gank in highsecthey should be able to work with cans because otherwise it is still a jump from a hauler to 15 bil rorq which takes more isk in skillbooks to train than a freighter as welledit and both should be teir 1 to help with insurance losing that much cargo is already enough hurt
this is a myth empire is more profitable than lowsec and 00 period in empire you dont have to spend your time defending your space you dont have to safe up or cloak every time a hostile gang enters the system you have concord to avenge your death you dont have to pay anyone rent or a pirate isk to have him leave you alone you dont have to organize defense to deal with pirates that you are unwilling to pay if you are in an npc corp you pay no taxes on your ratting bounties time spent not gaining isk is lost isk this is called oppertunity cost the profit minus the cost of playing the 00 game currently makes pveing in highsec a much better choice for pve gameplay and general iskmaking ideally i want a system where it is profitable for pve players to pay pvp players isk to defend them while they ratmission in 00 or lowsec or if they so choose take the risk of ratting solo for even greater gain
there is always the solution of buffing the income from 00 carebears get to keep their lvl 4 missions and the people in 00 can make isk i rat in a t2 fit ishtar and can only get about 15mil an hour and that with a full set of bs rats and noone else in system sadly to do that i cant salvage or loot and the salvage from a serpentis rat isnt particually good to anyway so its not a huge losstheres so little decent 00 space its unreal buffing it a fair amount will decrease the rewards in high sec and hopefully sort out the risk vs reward and as i said the carebears keep their lvl 4 missions and dont need to whine about losing their risk free income
but an ishtar has two extra high slots that it cant put guns on why is it too hard to put a salvager and tractor beam in those slots
so 00 missions are roughly balanced with 00 ratting but only 10 as good as hisec missionsby your own logic hisec missions are enormously overprofitable qedand i agree although not perhaps with the 10x factor hisec l4s are not only more profitable due to essentially no overhead than 00 pve theyre also far more profitable than any other empire pve trading invention etc are fine thats a pvp activity the rewards from empire mining and exploration are horrible in comparison and empire mining leaves the miner subject to various kinds of harassment and riskthe numbers tell the story far more people mission that undertake any other kind of pve they dont necessarily do this because theyre risk averse but because its the most profitable riskreward ratio i do it myself and i have no objection to risk sure the best 00 ratting beats missioning but its risky takes considerable effort to obtain and retain is a limited resource and is highly subject to interruption over time there is simply nothing to touch hisec missioningtheyre flat out imbalanced against hisec losec and 00 and with the upcoming hisec change the already minimal level of risk will be reduced even further fine now that the maths of ganking means that i can safely increase the value of my cnr fit i can improve my tank train up fofs and really afkmission my wallet level way up
dont put words in my mouth malcanis thats beneath you i neither said nor implied thatactually i would have to say that high sec missions as they are are probably about right  although its quite variable depending on your skill levelfor instance i can solo l4s in my dominix the very first one i ever soloed was a blockade i did it successfully and didnt even lose a drone however it took about six hours to complete solo and at my skill level its still somewhat dangerous remember not even 10 million sps and those arent all combat by any means although a lot of them areso for me its probably balanced because it takes so long for someone with better skills and more isk for a much more tuned mission ship its another storyall of which is a long way of saying it depends i didnt say that in fact i thought i was being clear that the 00 ratting i do is considerably more profitable at least in my particular milieu others mileage may vary i have exchanged comments with boatloads of people that dont loot or salvage their missions if i dont theyre entirely too little isk for the time the variance in performance is very highsorry no youre making a very large leap of assumption there as to why there are so many missioners and it being all about isk to be sure youre right for some missioners but there are those who do it for many other reasons for some its just that they dont enjoy the combat pvp elements of eve from my limited experience i cant say as i blame them youre not stating a fact youre making an assumption you may be right you may also be wrong my own personal experience flies entirely in the face of your position i can cj back to my missioning bb anytime but i seldom do it pays less and is less fun  but the key argument here is that it pays less at least for someone with my play situation and styleto be honest while finding the right situation is harder i find it much less risky more profitable and ive rarely been interrupted in our new space for me its superior to high missioning in every way it pays more its less risky and its both more interesting and funhowever others milage may vary but from where i sit your assumptions are wrong whether thats a generalized reality or a personalized one i havent the data to say i would agree that low sec is badly out of whack i believe that high sec and null sec both could use a lot of tuningsee my other post for my thoughts on how i think high sec missioning might be improved heres the link to it
i seriously doubt your only 10 more profitable as people claim that 01 missions so no pirate implants from lp give out 60 millions hours top runners probably the same people that will get mroe than 30 milions hour in high seceven disregarding that the simple fact that in 01 you get roughly x2 the lp of the same mission in high sec mean about 6 extra millions for each mission so 912 extra millions each hour and then there is the chance for better spawns in the variable spawns missions with the possibility of a true faction spawn i will test 00 missions rewards as i am moving a 4 months character in npc pirate land to do missions he is up to level 3 missions i am very curious to see what will be his per hour return i highly doubt it will be only a 10 more than high sec missions of the same level
you forget to calculate interruptions shiplosses during missionsdue to pvp time spent defending the area with additional shiplosses time spent hauling your stuff to better markets etc there might be bigger spikes in income in 00 but in general over time its not impressive
so far my return ratting in 00 have been well above my return in level 4 missions both when i was in wicked creek and now losses have always been because i was distracted or if i wanted to engage the enemy
with regards to fw missions i know very little about them however they really should tie into militia success somehow if they dont already the simple way to do this would be to count them toward vps in a way similar to complexes perhaps they should have somewhat less effect since they carry the advantage of being in a specific preknown locationas an alternative missions could have an indirect benefit to the militia completing them for example it might shift one or more undiscovered complexes from friendlycontrolled systems to enemycontrolled systems or it might reveal the location of one or more asyet undiscovered enemy complexes or something similar
yes you can capture an hostile unrestricted plex with an inty for the aggro and a cruiser to shoot the frigs but then youre bound to get stomped really quicklyall in all i dont think that its a serious issuei suggest this  a fixed number of plexes per faction per constellation instead of the current system  less vp for capping a plex in a system with many other open plexes this way the current balance can be retained while eliminating the insanity of having to defend plexes in uncontested systems just to have them respawn in another uncontested system instead of the last enemy system in the constellation
i spent about 2 weeks in and out trying to cap the semou constellation in coordination with our militias other fcs after roushzar was captured no matter what we did we couldnt cap a system would greatly appreciate a clearer approach and some form to measure progress
i support what is discussed in this thread and also would like that ccp would clear up the system capturing mechanism a lot
i support the ideas in the ophaving a clearer idea of how plexing stands in various systems would be very nice if you warp in and see a major plex up it would be great to know hey this system is not far off flipping lets focus our attackdefense here for the time being and see if we cant getstop a flipi think the current plexing system with random spawns of random size is unneccesarily complicated and a little cumbersome
there definitely needs to be more feedback on how close a system is to flipping and i agree with the other points also however id also like to add that the fw end game of the system actually flipping is just so incredibly dull at the momentcurrently when a system goes vulnerable a huge enemy fleet captures the control bunker within about 510 minutes and thats it instead there needs to be a system vulnerability subgame perhaps spread over a 2448 hour period where each side has a chance to form a large fleet perhaps call in a few capital ships and have some kind of epic final battle over the control bunker to decide whether the invaders get to take the system or notanything that encourages large fleet confrontations is good for fw in my humble opinion
just fyi roushzar was capd using around 58 ships
i totally agree mechanics are far too cheesy the spread of systems also makes it very hard to find those 35 man frigate fights we all enjoyed so much at the beginning of fwtime for ccp to get tweaking and not let fw die

deathsyphon looks around and sees all the people in support are on our alliances kb low sec already needs a boost sooooo yeahhh noalso im pretty sure sentry guns have seen some changes since 2004
yesfights at belts yes there are many fights at belts due to the rubbish roids and piddly frigate npc bounties fights at station yes there are many fights at stations where people can tank and dock whenever they wantfights at pos  yes lets fight at a pos where there are guns neut batterys jams batteries and a convienient shield for the defender to sit afk infights at etc there is no etc the only place to get a target with any degree of regularity is at a gatethe sentry guns in their present statealready encourage blobbing to help tanking qyou guys are big bullies why you not 1v1 meabecause previous carebear whines lead to sentry guns being set up then another whine lead to them being indestructable as such a gang is neccesary to take out a targetprevent 50 of ships and fittings being used by the outlaws no intys to tackle no close jammers no nano fits heavy tanks mandatory remote reps advisorythis thread is supported by a few bears who may have been into low sec once or twice and got ganked and have no experience of being an outlawskunk
no  there will just be more blobsbeing a pirate will therefor require being in big ass blobsanother update to increase fleet sizesfail
also there are enough penalties for being an outlaw as it islike you cant fire on ppl without sentry agression but they can fire on you and then your friend cant help without taking sentry fire etc etc etcbut its good like that because if it was great being a pirate then everyone would be then it would suk so meh

seems reasonable sentry drone fire is pretty feeble atm
im in support of sent messages being saved on your own hard drive if you like with some sort of option box but i dont support an in game sent mail box i want a faster eve server not a slower one
plz read whole post before commenting as not to miss an argument i may have already addressedintrowell apparently theres already a pos topic up but the link in steels index by topic sticky is just a link to her own sticky somehowso time for a new onetheres a discussion in the featuresideas forum 3rd edit the link to said discussion is below
i agree on your statement that pos warfare sucks  ive bin sitting at a pos for about 48 hours a day the past days  wich i could have spend doing small gang warfare  but i dont like the new neighbours so i just sit at that pos making sure there are no new neighboursbut your solution makes no sense do you know how much effort it takes to make an outpost  i can tell you that id rather sit at the pos then having to make 3 outposts in every fing system 
while i will agree pos warfare  sov warfare sucks imoi cant really agree with your suggestionso basically alliances will spam every moon and you have to kill every pos before you can do anything there sounds familiar
ahh i must have comeabout the wrong waysee that was just off the top of my head didnt really think it through it wasnt exactly a serious proposal it was more of an example as to if i can think of anything random now whhy the hell havnt ccp done anything after ages and agesedit i have edited the post to better explain what i mean
low sec is calling i think you should answer some of us enjoy the pos game if you cant take the heat stay in npc 00 space with the rest of the bottom feeders
you enjoy the benefits of pos the income the security they provide who doesnthave you ever actually sieged regions  have you had to kill 100s of pos just to be able to even dream of capping a stn  getting up for alarm clock ops because thats when the towers come out  spending hours on end repping shields and mods if that is fun for you fair play your in the minoritycurrently the system offers a lot of protection if you can get some pos setup claim sov etc you pretty much have a safe haven unless someone want to lay siege and spend the time and money taking it outits not like the old days where you could come home and the stn has been capped
the pos game isnt really terrible except for one thing it is terribly time consuming when it probably could stand to go a fair bit faster i would propose reducing module total hp on poss and slightly reduce pos shield hp reducing module hp on poss means less time incapping guns and the rep squad can repair them all back up in a faster period of time lowering this mundane task defenders already have the advantage with stront timing reducing module hp on a pos will have no effect on the outcome of a particular battle if the defenders show up to defend also for eves sake lower the hp of station services 10x small gangs should be able to take them out in a timely fasion and small repair gangs should be able to repair them in a timely fasion sarcasm warningi know lets encourage small gang warefare by requiring large fleets to take down defenseless structures in a reasonable amount of time then require the defenders to sit there repairing it for an hour or two after the attackers leave out of boredom
this issue seems to be growing cold so id like to kick it againto summarize events up to now back in the first csm meeting this issue was raised and ccps response was that it was impossible or at least difficult to allow alliances as a whole to participate they also said that it would be very easy to allow individual corps to join militias while still remaining in an allianceim extremely disappointed that this has not been followed up on it really is silly that dedicated rp alliances especially are barred from participating unless they disband the alliance and this simple change would alleviate the issue if necessary the standings requirement could be raised to protect fw from largescale interference or there could be a higher requirement for corps that are in alliancesplease put more emphasis on this i understand that there are many more critical things to address but this is an easy change according to ccp that would benefit a great number of people for whom the events of fw are importantthank you
supported my reason though is that by allowing alliances in to faction warfare might mean longstanding naps will be broken resulting in more wars and changes in 00
many rp alliances have been left out of something they have wanted for a long time they shoudlnt have to divide or break up communitys just for something like this let them join
this makes me angry i paid way too damn much for a for mining lasers if they were selling pickaxes cheap also the medium heavy mining drones has been sent to be looked at a broad sweeping change to all industry is being looked into a new minifreighter for the poor amongst us all they need to do is give 10 terrible arkonor and 00 super veld and i will be happyedit a mining ship focused on drones would be awesome i love my little bees
this
giving the exequoror a 1020 level boost to mining drone yield would seem to fill this role as well as giving the gallante a mining cruiser
yes yes you are
vexor special ability 5 bonus to medium hybrid turret damage per level and 10 bonus to drone hitpoints damage and mining yield per skill levelaccording to eft with drone rigs yes i do realize rigs on a cruiser it outmines every other cruiser size ship i tried including the osprey which is the best unrigged that i could come up with i was talking about barge but hell i would cross train gallente bs if the dominix got that bonus snuck in somewhere too
well i dont think that missions should be the primary source of income for everyone in 00 in low sec its easy to find agents and if needed ccp can easily add more that is a large part of the issue i talked about technically it doesnt matter if we nerf high sec or increase the rewards in 00 but by leaving high sec as it is and greatly increasing rewards in low sec00 we increase the flow of isk into the game something that isnt necessarily so good for the game besides that if you are a hardcore pve mission runner you use a small fraction of ships compared to a pvper in 00 why do you need all that isk when you are supposedly only playing to have fun doing missionsmaybe you didnt notice where i said pr hour so that there would be a flow of available missions into one agent but that agent cant support a limitless number of missionrunners there isnt any real difference to boosting lowsec00 and nerfing highsec one just brings a lot more isk into the gameno teamwork isnt required but should be rewarded not punished as it is today if you just want to chat in a noob channel why do you care if highsec missions are nerfed
my post was not directly targeting your original post esmenetthat being said teamwork is rewarded in eve just fine you may not think so but my isk per hour goes up greatly when missioning in teams instead of alone in fact since i dont run a lootsalvage alt my best friend greatly benefits from teamwork especially when there is another person running missions with me to kill the npcs while he cleans up behind usas i have said before i agree that basic loot should be removed and i also agree with the idea of making npcs less numerous and more difficult to subdue thereby reducing the amount of isk generated by loot but not isk generated by bounty just because a few groups out there maximize their profits in empire space by blitzing missions doesnt mean that the majority do and in fact not a single person in my corp uses a ravennavy raven for mission running because we all pretty much hate missiles i for instance use a rohk with 8 rails not exactly an optimal mission runner but i like it and thats what matters so you would nerf the vast majority of players to stop farmers who would simply focus their efforts elsewhere and continue to generate large amounts of isk because thats what they choose to do everyone keeps talking about isk faucets but the fact remains that something has to inject isk in order for the system to exist if you take out all the isk faucets then you eliminate the amount of isk available to the player base and actually start to diminish that isk rapidly due to things like buying something and then selling it for a loss lateryes there is a vast amount of isk being poured into the game but there is isk being poured back out too my friend is about the worst shopper i have ever seen and probably blows half his income buying things and selling them at a loss and gets more domis blown up in missions than anyone i have ever seen i myself dont always run missions and have lost my fair share of ships including two rohks recently amongst a small armada of rifters and blackbirds so again their is a group out there that blitzes missions all day long and generates a massive amount of income with zero losses but not all and without a good study i think you will find that most mission runners dont run more than a hand full of missions and dont account for the huge isk faucet that they can be if abusedso yes i would support a limit to the number of missions you could run with an agent but not limiting it to 1 in high sec per agent because that simply makes it tedious to play casually 35 would be ideal in my opinion but i would still rather see missions in 0 and low sec be brought up to financial par with missions in high sec in regards to how much a high sec belt rat earns you compared to a low sec belt rat then add many more mission running outlets because the existing ones would become the focus of a lot of attention and unless your in good with the pirate factions there are not a lot of them to work for so the blob warfare would just center around mission hubs making them virtually useless unless it was completely captured and secured and then it would be farmed mercilessly and be much worse than it is nowi dont really see your solution as resolving any problems but simply redirecting them elsewhere which isnt a solution at all you claim that missions are risk free when they are not they might be low risk but not risk free high sec mining is only riskier than mission running because of the efforts to stop macro mining and has little to do with competing for resourcesa miner can focus and gear completely towards mining and compete very well with a single mission runner in high sec who is focused on doing the same they make even more when working in concert with others to speed the process along so teamwork is rewarded others will abuse the system by blitzing or macro mining but thats not the fault of all but a minority you will never be rid of

i know i am not the only one out there that has been finding more and more people using missions as safe spots in low sec 04  01i feel that the saftey a mission gives you in low sec from probes is a joke to the point where i have even heard of carriers hiding in missions to avoid being probed out quickly it took my m8 15 minutes with max skills to probe out a carrier hiding in a missionadded on top of this is people who are doing missions for the mission in low sec these offer better rewards than high sec missions yet dont offer little differance in risk  as it is oftern impossiable to probe them out before they can finishloot and even salvage their missioni feel something need to be done to make either ship probes better at finding ships in missions or having a system where the lower the sec of the system the easier it is to probe out a ship in a mission to the point where a 00 mission is no different from a normal safespot this would make probing a usefull skill for pvp and will even out the benfits  risk of low sec missions chapters
lol agreedits kind of like winning the lotteryccp are carebears d here it comes  edit i give myself a thumbs up
chapters makes a good point something needs to be done before probing becomes useless as everyone is hiding in missions
probing missions is trivial
that may be so but i agree with chapters probing mission runners is really like hitting the jackpot at a casino you could spend an hour trying to probe out a mission running raven and not find it however you can get lucky and probe out a frig in your first hit there is no consistancy its just too unevenprobing for pvp needs to be looked at to make it more equal for the pvp side of eve as the current system is too heavy in the favour of mission runners
capital ships hiding in mission deadspaces am i missing something here are capital ships allowed through deadspace gates nowand are you suggesting that doing missions in low sec is no more of a risk than doing missions in high sec
excuse me the rewards given by lowsec missions are laughable compared to the increased risk and 15 minutes to probe someone down in a mission is nothing given the fact that missions take a long time of sitting in one spotif you drop 20 au probes across the system dont scan for drones etcthen yeah if you scan for probes use strong scanstrength probes exploration probes are a guaranteed hit if you use them right then its trivial
get better skills the deadspace effect of the mission work only after the acceleration gate and carriers cant use acceleration gates so either he had very high sensor strength or you have very low skills
would you like cheese with your winefor crying out loud your throwing a fit about a carrier hiding in a safe spotthe same thing can be accomplished by a shuttle flying off into some unknown region for an hour and dropping a bookmarkyou cant stop this its utter insanity to even tryits called tactics like the guy said get better at iti sure as heck wouldnt allow an asset to be plainly in sight when its potentially exposed to a threatusing missions just happens to be quicker than running on your own power for a longer period of timethumbs downps no offense of course but lets be rational about this
wts reading comprehension skillbookedit in response to the below comment sos your mum edit2 seems i need to put sarcasm tags in to avoid confusion
wow thats real mature

ive noticed an increasing number of attacks and traffic issues when leaving busy stationssince in reality your not using the multiple if they are graphically present entryexits on a station why not just have a random exit point or more than one exit point that is randomly chosen for you when you leave a station to prevent station camping and or traffic jamsive been on the freeway during rush hour but this is ridiculousok back to seriousness any comments
random undock points would have been a far better solution to this problem than the 15degree solution that ccp put in a few months back
the mastodon has by a large margin the lowest capacity of the deep space transports but the only real problem is that 30k is something of a magic number for cargo space for reasons the op mentioned the mastodon simply doesnt fit in its class a tiny bump in cargo capacity to bring it over 30k brings it inline with the other deep space transportsthe fact that an t1 industrialthe itty v can so easily hold more cargo than a t2 transport is pretty screwed up on its owntheres probably only five or six people in eve who fly a mastodon so sadly this postthread is probably a complete waste of time
since electronic warfare modules are not very viable in effectiveness on non specialized ewar ships anymore it has removed a large role from new players wanting to get into pvp sending them into weeks or months of extra training to get these sort of ships and placing them only in the role of a tackler in most engagementsi suggest a restrengthening or balance of ecm jammers and also eccm modules which would give more options to new players small gangs and a better chance at fighting other forms of electronic warfarei do not think they should be as strong as specialized ships however in their current form it is exceedingly rare or nonexistent to see this stuff fit on non specialized craft and game play has become slightly more static in variables
id rather buff eccm than nerf ecm
there are t1 frigates and cruisers with specialized ew platforms a new player can get an ew boat on the first day
hey all i just had this thought on a way to make rr gangs a little more balanced why not make cap transfers remote armor reps and shield transporters need a hardpoint of their own just like missiles or turrets several ships could have at least one allowing for at least some rr potential but not a massive spider tank mind you this isnt a huge theory ive though through as the idea popped into my head about 5 minutes ago so go easy thoughts and comments are welcome
why do you think that rr gangs need balancing  in what way do you think they are unbalanced
rr gangs are not unbalanced
remote rep gangs are fine they require a lot of coordination and experience to pull off they only work up to a limited size and a competent enemy fc can alter targets rapidly enough to help negate its advantages
remote reps put a limit on gang size too you can only pack so many ships into a 4km radius sphere 75km optimal on large remote reps
alright i know there are other posts about low sec i have read some of them but unlike the ones that i saw that turn into a bunch of people going back and forth on ideas this one is a simple yes ccp i think that something should be done with low sec to improve it or no ccp low sec is fine leave it alone if you think yes you support if you so not well figure it out
its a nice idea but your thread is too vague those who vote no and so want lowsec to remain static are both in the minority and in for some disappointment eve is going to change in some form
i understand what youre sayingive always thought there needs to be something done about low sec but what exactly that is the question i would love any major change to it as i spend 99 of my eve time there so it would be interesting to watch it change anyway atleast ccp are constantly developing as far as i know the only online game that is reallyfw was a start anyway
what he saidyou can imagine the meetingcsm the players think that something should be done about low secccp ok what did you have in mindcsm that wasnt part of the proposal we are supportingccp
rockets are brokena system which never hits the target and does 2 less than a blaster 3 times less than a lazerbut not only rockets all missiles need rebalance
edit oh dear i read the topic and posted my support instnantly thats bad newssounds like a good solution to me
i endorse this product
on shc we had a discussion about the infamous csm mailing list which has been requested to be made completely public i wont argue again why i dont think it should be made public but i would like to discuss how we can streamline it in order to make itat least its roles publicright now the csm uses the mailing list for mainlyin order1 exchanging submission templates2 discussing the next agenda3 any ccp communication at any time4 general chatvery little actuallythese things could be become transparent by ccp giving us the tools to do so and it wont just benefit transparency but also effectivityin order to streamline the submission templates a wiki as previously requested is very much needed it will promote collaboration inside the csm transparency and discussion its a winwin situationa csmonly forum is also dearly needed due to the nature of the assembly hall it does by no means promote discussion due to the massive amounts of support threads in which any attempt at discussion drowns while that couldand should be addressed by allowing people to vote without posting but allowing for csm to discuss in an asynchronous manner would promote more discussion around key issues being raised arithron has repeatedly pointed out that there is a lack of communication on issues and rightfully so right now most discussion happen during the actual meetings which is a bad use of time in many aspects if all discussion happen during the week trough a forummailing list is bad for that it would possibly allow the csm to actually work together on getting certain issues which otherwise gets voted down now due to their weakness would get troughthis has to be addressed somehow so to sum up1 a wikipediareadonly for the public should be available for the council in order increase the collaboration 2 a csmonly forum should be available in order to promote discussion inside the csm3 it should be possible to support a topic in the assembly hall without having to post in the thread
i agree and we brought this up in iceland and were still waiting on it 
exactly but a bit of lobbying doesnt hurt eh
actually you already have such a facility the jita park speakers forum exactly what it was intended for you present your ideasissues just like everyone else afterall just because you are on the csm doesnt mean you have to present all the ideas or that your ideas are any good they are discussed you interact with players and come to a consensus and a sensible issue to post in the assembly hall after 7 days if the required amount of support or if a csm member supports it it goes to a csm meetingwhat happens at the moment is that most ideasissues bypass the jita forum entirely so its little wonder that a thread has supports in it all the timewhat is really needed is not a forum limited to csm or the like as these are just tools that can be ignored as mailing lists etc but a weekly issue discussion meeting by the csm not a voting meeting but a discussion and brainstorm on the popular issues from the assembly hall forum not to much to ask reallytake carearithron
well i see your point but the problem is that very few actually read this forum leave alone posting here a formal forum for it would be much better i think
very few read it csm members or playersif very few read it now its probably due to the fact that issues and ideas are all put on assembly hall i fail to see how your arguement holds up no one reads a forum designed to discuss ideas and issues but we need a forum to discuss ideas and issuestake carearithron
my point is as i stated that there needs to be a formal forum for it be it the jita speakers corner or forum y there just needs to be created awareness around it anyways but you also miss the point that it should be csmonly which the csm has already requested
actually i disagree that it should be csm onlythe csm currently ignore the forums and the mailing lists and the ingame channel for discussion purposes having another forum will just show how bad the communication really isi disagree entirely that you need a csm forum only due to the fact that you have been elected to listen interact and discuss issues with players the issues being raised in csm meetings should be player issues  as a player you may have a good idea or two it should not be a personal soapbox and vehicle to bring forward issues that directly benefit a csm memberthere has been a preponderance of issues of late from certain csm members most show a poor understanding of the wider game and even at times a poor understanding of the area they will affect this thinking by certain csm members that their ideas are somehow better than other ideas has to stop personally id change csm member issue raising id like to see only issues that have been collaborated on by numerous csm members or checked by allowed to be posted as issues id keep the ability of players to post issues as it standstake carearithron
well you didnt get the point obviouslyright now we use the meetings to ask questions and discuss with the person who is raising the issue by giving an area for the csm to take these discussions in a thread which everybody can read but only csm reply it will facilitate discussion much better in my eyesthere is an issue with the assembly hall as it is now because there is so much spam due to the whole support thing well thats just a cheap shot but okwhy csm members are part of the community tooit wouldnt change a thing people would just work around that whole thing sorry to say i understand where you are coming from but the world is not perfect lets not work against the the council and its productivity just to try and make it like the world is perfect
i agree with you that the assembly hall makes it hard to follow a discussion hence why i stated earlier these discussions need to happen in the forum already in existance jita park speakers forum i also agree that the discussion needs to happen earlier i just can not see how providing a forum for the csm only will encourage them to discuss issues most dont use the tools available already blaming these for the ills and using them as justification for not discussing is poor form imo some use them successfully eg dierdra and her bhmerc thread you and the t1 loot thread etcpoor issues posted by some csm members is a cheap shot its a fact the evidence is there for all to see illthought through they reach the meetings and are promptly voted down not because there is a conspiracy to reject issues presented by x but because the issue is a nonissue or a poor oneby making csm members discuss issues before posting you get at least a better chance of a decent issueidentified issue it also shows that the csm is putting some effort into issue discussion apart from in voting meetingspersonally id like to see weekly discussion meetings where issues are selected from forums for further discussion these are discussed by the csm with input from a variety of viewpoints csm members are then tasked with development of an issue in the jita park forum and finally the issue is presented in the assembly hall for the 7 day period then voted on etctake carearithron
probable troll post is probably a troll howeverthen why the  are they playing eve online
the key here is in the phrase socalled pvp i dont do it personally but it looks to me like theres no player skill involved it boils down to who has the biggest blob the biggest sp total or the biggest wallet if that actually is the case i can understand why people wouldnt bother with itbesides eve is a complex and involving game  the pew vs pew is only one level industry mining missions ratting etc are other levels and if people enjoy those more than the pew vs pew then  shrugspeaking as a high sec carebear however a certain level of player predation is necessary to keep a little bit of edge in the game if this was in the assembly hall it would not be getting my thumbsup

in short i disagree with the need for this find some friends to do exploration with if you dislike changing ships for it
no make them unanchor after 30 days please
interesting point ill ponder it further once ambulation is implemented and i can sit in jita 44 strumming my luteplaceholder post so i can find this again when i get home
ive been reading quite a bit on the forums lately and see quite a few posts revolving around the same subjects 00 cap ships sov pos and how they all created laga few good postslocal chat increaseing the emptyness of spaceposts reminding me of the good ol daysa man with a vision might get a bit lenghty but bear with me 1st off ive never ran a pos or managed it ive looked into the logisticsisk but never actually did the haulingive been around for quite a few years started sometime after the bs were rolled outthe 1 thing that everyone is blameing other things on the lack of fun lag blobs ect comes from 1 thing  there is no longer an average of under 10000 players logged on anymore its more than tripled pos were created so it wasnt a station blob caps created cause of the roaming fleet blob sov created to spread out the pos warefare in hopes of creating multiple battles at the same time instead of blob each and every towerwe need to put the vastness of space back in the game to give the fun backsome ideas from the past week reading various posts they all kinda work off each other where as alone i probably wouldnt be all that interested1 kill local i like the idea of local more or less as alliance or fleet or channels of that nature you can see those that have talked but not sure if they are still there if nothing else so you can only see those in local in your alliance or friendly something like that even if its only in 002 caps keep caps in 00 make a carrierfreigter hybrid hangers ect of carrier but no mods like a freighter for 00low sec possibly some inbetween bscap ship for low sec lots of ideas out there but i havnt read much on it just know the feeling reading the 1st couple post on some of those threads titans well id be for limiting the ammount of titans to 1 per constalation an alliance holds 2 const then 2 titans consinder it the ammount of resources needed to be gathered to maintain the titan without actually putting an upkeep costmaterials on it3 sov aspect of 00 pos and sov sov should be maintained per constalation possibly per sub constalation and branch out from there each region have a hub only controlled by holding a high mojority of constalations each constalation a hub controlled by holding the majority of the sytems when an alliance holds a region each constalation has to be assigned to a corps of that alliance it is theirs to defend and maintain and if its just a region then each system in essence spreading the fleet in a manner where each system maintaineddefended 4 the key the key to making this work ccp started on it but my thinking was they were createing the traffic advisory to limit traffic to stop the lag and blobs i think that is the way to go limit 00 systems to 300 each claimed system can have a max of 150 of the holder and friendlies if hostiles jump in even if theres only 100 friendlies they can only bring in 150 this brings lag to its brink of playability this also means a large alliances are going to make multiple strikes spreading out multiple battles creating more funlogistics that the carriers were meant for the holder of the system can further limit rights to renters keeping them out of hubs as they own the stargate possibly creating the need of hackers in hostile fleets adding a bit more fun this is also going to bring better use out of fleet organization each fleet you know is not going to be bigger than 150 so your not going to take 50 caps 50 bs and 50 support more likely only 25 caps 85 bs 40 support or some where along those lines
this  imagine how many chinese farmers would die in the first week  lol ccp are against selling isk online anywayand omfg this is an awesome and well thought out ideaim getting tingles thinking about it a lone pilot spends his day off in a dead end 01 system without being hassled then all of a sudden a rapier uncloaks next to him imagine the shock d its how it f should beoh im mining at a belt deep deep in no mans land but its ok i will know soon as someone enters the same solar system ie millions and millions of kilometers wide as me
anyone who disagrees with making this happen is just soft and probobly cries when they get ganked
i like this idea i think would bring a whole knew level to compation for control of a system and because of thatthumbs up
its certainly worth pushing in front of ccp to see what they think imo
currently mission farmers can crank out faction ammo at a tenth the amount of time it takes a builder to produce the t2 anologue from a researched bpo and sell said faction ammo at stupid rates of profitccp needs to look into the faction ammo issue and modify t2 so that it is no longer overshadowed by a t1 ammo that can be produced by the 5000unit lot in 110th the time it takes to build the same quantity from a researched t2 bpo much less an invented t2 bpccurrently t2 is laughable few would bother when t1 faction is more available and has none of the idiotic nerfs
agreed faction stuff should in my opinion always offer an edge over the corresponding t1 and t2 equivalents but in the case of many t2 ammo types the disadvantages are too extreme
issue pos warfaresov sucks

i just got a black ops sin and have been enjoying cloaking outside of stations just next to the undock point when a target undocks i decloak lock with 2 sensor boosters and blow him up loot dock and resetthe sin makes a great solo ship and is pretty entertaining also you guys seem to be forgetting that you can reach a larger jump range with skills by default you start with a 40 ly jump range so 20 ly is acceptable a 25 ly start would be great though of courseas for fuel i am not sure as to how jumping other ships through a jump bridge works so i cant make a statement on that anyone care to explain

against the nerf
nerf is too harsh
against the nerf increment missile speed explosion velocity and add 200 falloff on webs
good ideas semkhet you should clik the box to actually vote against it web falloff is a great idea imo but not voting properly here is a bad one

in low sec and npc 00 it forces people to raise standing with npc factions to see whos in local not fun in deep 00 more pos stuff bleah not supported
role specific ships and the ability to rent intel pretty sure he already said thatgives people the upper hand if its their home
nice idea but i think youve gone far far too overboard discussing specifics features and ideas is the forum of initial ideas and discussion it is better to post there discuss it refine it and get it in such a format to present here that already covers the ins and outs and therefor comes to a straight show of support
come on guys there must be more people than this who have an opinion about it
excellent suggestion i would support this change to the ui
supported
minor necro because this issue came up again in ships and modules i dont think csm discussed this if they did sorry for bringing it up againi know csm doesnt want to spend time on specific ship fixes thats cool but maybe just pass along a note to ccp with a post it note saying seriouslythe ship is essentially useless and could use a better role or buff
running out to lunch and unable to read in detail for now butperhaps change the procurer to a tech i gas harvester bonused barge
i think that ccp wanted mercoxit to be something dangerous that only specialized ships can minethat would explain the skill and specialized lasers a specialized ship is then only the next stepsomething went wrong though or they scrapped the ideasounds goo imo it still has to be improved though it is ridiculous that combat ships do a better job than the specialist ships
oh yeah of course mining produces minerals whereas missions dont oh wait silly me and to reply to the op the procuror has a role  its the mining ship after a frigate for miners who dont want to train for combat ships
three points to make1 so then by your logic frigates are for other than mining what knitting2 the cruiser skill doesnt necessitate combat combat can happen at any time no matter what you fly also do you know for example what a logistics ship is focused towards not forgetting the osprey and scythelast i heard one of if not the most famous player in eve pilots a revelation for mining veldspar 3 the procurer is still awful refer to all the posts saying the procurer is awful some of them make good points about why it is awful
procurer  baed mmmkay
supporting procurer loveits cute
you also forgot that ratting cant support as many people as missions and in a lot of the 00 space you can not run missions because woops they are player controlled sov
this topic is going around in circles the mission protectors have yet to accept the fact that you make more isk on average in high sec running missions than in 00 ratting its so obvious a fact that im amazed they cant accept it well not amazed most of them are trying to protect their cash cow and i guess thats just human a bunch of good ideas have been hatched on how to fix this personally my opinion goes for a genereal nerf of high sec pve income coupled with a small buff to low sec this would be to reduce the economic draw backs of just boosting everything this will also help solve the low sec population issue once you can make more iskh doing pve in low secn than in high sec people will start moving backsome anonymous bear will no doubt reply to this exclaiming i will never go to low sec and that might be true however many will and thats all that matters
let the bears keep their lvl 4 missions but instead buff low sec to be like 00 currently is maybe a little more on top of that and then buff 00 so it has double or triple its current rewards the systems stay as good as they currently are you just get more isk out of them and the bears get to keep their hi sec cash cow everybody wins
well it would seem as a really good suggestion until you realise the fact that all you have done is essentially nerf high sec and then pumped a hell of a lot of isk into the system causing run away inflation its much better to just nerf the high sec pve rewards boost low sec pve up to a point where it is still less than 00 and leave 00 as it is this keeps balance in regards to isk in the system
what will actually fix this is not just nerfing lvl4s or boosting lowsec which badly does need a boost simply make lvl4 access only viable through player corps not npc corps then any pirate corpalliance can easily pay concord to go to warits that simple ccpbut wait thatll force people to pvp yes eve is a pvp game its harshoh wait this isnt 2006
the figures summarised jarvis post not mine and you read the figure wrong as well
translation we want easy kills bad bad ccpgive us easy kills now
translate this to everyone who has a different experience than max would like cannot accept reality as max sees itummm nolet me be absolutely crystal clear here your fact which you harp on so much is not universal i have an expensive rigged mission dominix up in empire i use it to solo l4s sometimes its collecting dustwhy two reasonsreason 1 l4s solo are boring sure you can make isk but i play eve for fun and grinding through rats for hours is dull dull dull if theres no challenge and no one else to work withhowever were they as lucrative as you claim with your facts id suck that up when i wanted funds for something badly like the hac i just bought and the other one im saving for but you know  at my skill level and with the fits available etc 00 ratting makes me more isk per hour period which by the way is reason 2so for me at my skill level and skill choice your fact is pure fantasy its untrue no matter how you slice it keep in mind that i loot and salvage all my l4s and dont play in mission hubs where the thieves hang out so im getting the max out of those missions and still the ratting where i only seldom loot or salvage makes me more money in a given time frame oh and its also more funyour fact may well be true for a certain character with a specific skill set and ship fit etc however it is not universal it is not a fact for meand because of that forward starbow collects dust on her hull while archon and medea get a workout down in null secso there you go so much for your cash cow argument
its the general reality you might be different but thats just it youre the exceptionnot an argument as we have seen in these threads lots of people find mission running fun and do nothing but yes 00 ratting in certain systems are more profitable than level 4 running in general however thats not the case given the fact that in 00 you either have to work at keeping your space safe or you have to ninja rat and cloak up every time someone enters local thats a whole lot of time wasted no such waste in high sec mission running add to that the fact that the majority of 00 sucks ass and you might as well stay in high sec unless youre one of the lucky fewyou know the difference between generally true and absolutely trueyeah you owned that argument alright
i live near 10 angel space with triple 18m bounty rats in some belts competition for rats has some of my corp mates going back to empire on an alt to run missions that is fact all other arguments aside having unlimited missions vs ratting means missions can always become more lucrative no matter what space you in if your rat competition is highalso check out u4 in syndicate for missions sometime several q20 agents around there
so you tell me and it may be true but what data supports this assumption of yours is it merely your own personal experience which is no more universal than mine is it what everyone says we all know how reliable that isyour post presents your position as uncontrovertible fact without exception if you expect action on something when others doubt your position you should be prepared to back it up with facts i have yet to see anymy experience is the reverse of your fact for all i know youre just making it all up its a perfectly valid argument but i dont pretend or ever state that its a universal position i find mission running boring i know others do as well because they have told me so and i see no reason to disbelieve themnone of which is a problem really im not calling for a change to the status of missions  if there are others who enjoy them thats fantastic with a bit of tweaking to make them less repetitive and more challenging i would tooagain your mighty fact that everyone should know and understand suddenly has huge holes in it that you yourself admit let me be clear here i am not part of the lucky few ufa is a renter alliance we pay rent yes but we arent required to defend our space the landlords do that although we do help out because we like to be neighbourly we are the bottom of the 00 food chain if were the lucky few then boy id love to see what bob or the goons manage remember max renters get the crappy space not the primo real estate the holes in your position are now big enough to fit my dominix throughi do and you presented your statement as an absolute now that its indefensible in that way its only generally true if i do a bunch of research and find out that it is only true for a few rare folks with just the right set up and skills then what will it behow about some actual proof before people actually act on your facti rather think i did actually i refuted all your points with real facts based on solid experience this post tooi havent done extensive research on this and dont claim to have but i also am not coming in here and presenting my position as the truth that everyone knows and should admit to except that they dont want to in order to protect their cash cow you know that cash cow that i dont use because it doesnt make me as much as my other options and is less desireable for other reasons besidesmake your arguments with facts instead of rhetoric otherwise youll just keep digging your hole deeper and undermining your own position even if youre right on a broad level youll never convince anyone of it with statements like that
if the competition is too fierce it makes perfect sense that mission running would be better as the one resource is finite and the other infiniteim not sure why you bring up syndicate though  iirc thats 00 space were talking about empire missioning which is very differentyour point is well made that if the rats are ratted out then missioning is better when my belts are ratted out i generally go and do other things that need doing and leave the wallet work for a better day
sound ideassome sort of notify when system goes into vulnerable would also be nice corp mail maybe
fw veteran reporting ini agree with the concerns in this thread but i can also inform you that ccp requested a lot of information from the csm on how they can improve factional warfareand i wouldnt be surprised if we would see some improvements in the next empyrean age updateif there are no improvements ill raise this issue of courselink to the document i wrote for ccpthese are my personal views keep that in mind
some interesting ideas there i particularly like the general theme of trying to come of with nonpvp roles to play in fw i think it will be tough to come up with a fitting way to do this but its worth working towardheres another idea to consider though it would be specific to the amarrmatar front slavery on the matari side we have always longed for a game mechanic by which slaves could be freed there used to be a very bad mechanic for doing this agent offers that was largely detested until even that was taken away leaving nothing now we have this new war the pits the tribal liberation force stated goal freeing slaves against the 24th imperial crusade stated goal creating slaves and there is absolutely no mechanic dealing with slavesi propose1 place some new agents for each side at the matari agent slaves can be turned in mechanically this will be a repeatable mission akin to the cosmos trade missions with lp and standings rewards for completing them to place a bit of a limit on farming perhaps the number of slaves to complete each mission might increase each time or perhaps just each time within a given time period note that unlike the old agent offer this process does not generate freed slaves or slaves for either side if it did it would invite players with alts on both sides of the conflict to cycle the same people back and forth indefinitely2 drop slaves as loot in some form one possibly interesting way to do this might be to use the exploration system for example a tlf supporter might be able to probe exploration system an amarrian mining colony or slave convoy destroy it then carry back a number of slaves to freedom the normal fw plexes might drop some when a system is captured perhaps it could spawn a large number of probeable hidden sites where large numbers of slaves could be picked up in some cases convoys of haulers might be required giving the other side a new pvp objective  blockading the newly captured system and attacking transports looting it3 do the same thing for the amarrians but in reverse they are raiding matari settements for fresh slaves and transporting them back to 24ic hq for training4 keep counts of the numbers of slaves trainedfreed by either side as an additional incharacter scoreim not sure what the equivalent would be for the gallentecaldari front the gallente could certainly free slaves but it really isnt the focus of their conflict with the caldarijust some thoughts
my major irritation with fw is all of the above and the stallout of standings gainas you gain rank the percentage you get from each plex drops added to the natural reduction in returns as you approach 10in standard missions you recieve the same percentage gain for a particular mission regardless of your standings dependant on skillsie 250 for xyz mission if your standings are 1 or 10 ofc the amount your standing shifts depends on how far you are from 999 reducing that gap by 250now with faction warfare heres an exampleclearing a major complexunranked fw members recieve 4 lieutenants recieve 275 captains 081 and so on until you effectively recieve nothing for clearing complexes so not only is that gap between your current standing and 10 giving lesser returns as your standings go up youre recieving less standing with each mission thus higherranked members not recieving anything for their efforts but wrecks will toss fw aside with a bad taste in their mouththis alone will put fw into lifesupport very much like cosmos is now introduced with great fanfare and then allowed to languish into uselessness after the farmers have exploited it to death
agreed the falloff is too steep there should be some falloff but theres too much alternatively if there was some other form of award for helping capture a plex  like lp for example  i think that would go a long way toward making plex capture less uninteresting
clearly you dont know what you are talking about and have never flown with 1400mm yourself tp ranges are not synergisic with artillery and the tracking is so bad that even when shooting other bs from 100200km you hardly ever have your full rack hitthis is not about it looks ok in eft or whatever it is about the usage of these guns in practice they just dont deliver what was promised in the blurbyour quote from oveur is misplaced as all the supporters in this thread are not looking at anything in a simplistic way in fact the complaints largely stem from peoples experience of them in a whole variety of scenarios and what alpha anyway in the age of trimarks and ehp buffs even in mediumlarge gangs it all boils down to dpsehplockreload times
id rather say that you clearly never really used target painters surely because they suck of course tp have the same range as 1400mm in practice falloffso in mediumlarge gangs you need more than a whole magazine to kill a couple bs with 1400mm ii ha dont think so
in my opinione give tempest bonus that increase target painter optimal range to 140km and icrease amount ammo of 1400mm in clip and it will be enough give chance to this ship

several eveo posters in the past have attempted to resolve the issue of what is meant by market average in the eve market user interface the ui tool itself seems to work well but the meaning of this average is not clear and is not defined after researching this topic and not finding a conclusive answer i now bring the issue before the csmbe it resolved that ccp disclose the method of calculation for the market average as it is referred to in buysell order windows of the market interface the purpose of this information request is to allow users of this interface to understand the meaning of what is being displayed for them to further the proper use of this tool and their interactions with the eve marketplace

its literally the average price of all transactions of that type note that its not the average price of sell orders or buy orders but transactions so if two people bought from a sell order a gidget for 1 million isk each and then a mission runner sold ten gidgets he looted to someones lowball buy order for 1000 isk each the market average would be 21m  10100012  167500isk it doesnt matter at all that some scammer has one for sale for a billion isk  unless a sucker buys it i believe there is a choice for the period over which the average is calculated
do you really think someone who is willing to macro an entire setup to play the game extensively has not figured out how to send an evemail or start a convo besides virtually every other mmo has similar commands and still manages to fight macros i prefer functionality for players than pathetic and ineffective roadblocks for people who can easily get around them
yup like this ideaand nicely though out too
a nice write up and i agree that something must be done with the rigs that are specialized but not giving a bonus that would attract someone to use themand most importantly for drone rigs im waiting for something to happen since right now is almost impossible to use them on a drone boat in general drone boats tend to have lower pgcpu than the similar class ships of the other racesdevs did a good start with introducing rigs i hope they will continue this sooner than later
fyi theres already a set of modules for max locked targets and a skill for ewar falloff
i disagree theyve helped a great deal in allowing my completion of the kessel run in less than twelve parsecs otherwise nicely written posts  will read again more closely

noin principle if orders are able to execute the lowest price on limit orders merely ensures whos in line to get your money you placing a market order say you are willing to pay xxx amount having the lowest sell order just means that seller is first in line to take advantage of your mistakebad tradelack of market knowledgeas a market maker economic pvper that mechanic punishes people who take the time to identify you as a seller and then try to bypass your order they buy one trit at your price decide they dont like you and move up to the next highest order but your limit order is first in line so they just end up giving you even more money for the same tritwhich you bought from themthats the way it should be buys and sells nobody forces you to press an extra key nobody forces you to create an order for more than the ask pricethe mechanic is essential for mms to make a killing by working the spread in hostile alliances stations you make money they get more trades in the end it works out pretty good for everyone but you do the least work for your checkdo not kill market makers with this ridiculous idea
with all due respect do you think the seller is going to give a damnits a legal transaction  once you hit that enter key what do you expect oh i change my mind wont workand people already resort to violence anyway so its likely to end up being a wild goose chase and you still wont get your money back unless you hound himher half way across the galaxyare you sure you want to make this transaction with the option to opt out is far more logistical not to mention rationalits likening to walking up to some guy on the street and buying a watch only to find out you spent to much good luck finding the guy and killing him hell be miles away laughingpeople dont care about honor when it comes to selling goods anymore they just want your money just like any good enterprising trench coat wearing pilot in space trying to offload some goodsps personally i live entirely in the view details world of the market and always carefully pick what i want and double check the quantity but not everyone is good at thatsigned
i live entirely in view details when you say place a buy order it automatically sets the amount to the ask no excuse in order to make this mistake you have to be manually setting up a bid in which case you entered the transaction and you are at fault op says blah blah blah its using the wrong price when i make a mistake make my game easy for methe market interface shouldnt take care of lazy people they have every opportunity to protect themselves from spending money there is no such thing as nonconsensual market pvp if you dont want to play dont buyalso we already have a system for buying and selling to particular people ones we trust and at a price we agree to contractsthis is nothing more than a fix for inattentiveness

a goon after my heart te amo and here comes the shameless plugsimple changes regarding hp to improve 00 sov for all  shameless plugits ridiculous to have to try and understand how ccp screwed the pos changes when the anchorables were moved and the station services invented they were for small gang and we only take them out with full fleets 80mil sp its time ccp hunkered down and made alliances true stewards of their space unachor unattended installations get rid of ridiculous hp buffers that are protecting fail alliances from real pvp all of these suggestions would bring about siginificant and positive changes to 00 for all people these suggestions dont need massive testing or sov mechanics overhauls or new artdesign they are giving pilots back the abilitiy to do moar blob less and have moar fights do it now
what about making a pos very weak if it is not occupied by a defender have the shields only be at 50 if no one is home
just to clarify im supporting the option mentioned by ccp to allow individual corps to apply to militias while remaining members of an alliance they would still be required to meet the standings requirements that independent corps must meet to enlist in order for an entire alliance to join each member corp would have to meet that requirementaccording to ccp a change of this sort would be fairly easy to implement make it so we come for our people  but are currently being kicked out by the bouncers
yesthats all i have to say
the basic idea is to allow corps to declare war within specific spaces at a lower cost than normal this could be used for more specialized actions punitive wars barring an enemy from your space or just to make a point not to mention that 50 millionweek can be alot to newer playersall sample prices due weekly as normaltotal war 50 million for the entire cluster the current mechanicsempire war 15 million per empire allows you to declare war within an entire faction space such as the caldari state your enemies can still fly around as normal anywhere else notice that if youre going to dec within 3 factions you might as well go all outregional war 5 million isk per region this allows targeting of specific resources and with judicious use could be quite effective in hamstringing an opponent once again if you dec within 3 regions you might as well go for an empire dec instead unless youre being craftyconstellation war loosen up mr scrooge all current systems like mutuality and multipliers for extra wars would work as normal the reasoning behind this rp groups could rp with it alot industrial groups could declare war over a nice belt of veldspar without trashing their overall productivity people could fight over trade routes whatever yes this is obviously skewed towards piracy and low population pvp groups but it would benefit carebears as well because they could wardec and still be free to carebear with a little inconvenience the deccing corp could win by denying the resources of their enemies and moving that hulk every week would get to be giant sized pain in the ass lemme tell ya and finally it would behoove players to pay attention to where they are as a single concordokken could easily nullify the benefits of limited war some sort of firezone indicator could be placed on the neocom also mixing of war levels would be a necessity if someone decs you in metropolis there should be nothing preventing you from deccing them in the entire republic otherwise it could turn into battlegrounds
corponcorp war is 2 million its only 50 million if youre deccing a whole alliance as for the idea itself its not bad but its really not enough ill thumbsup it but wardecs need a lot bigger changes than just this one
good idea

if we look at the isk making methods miningroid  moon manufacturing in stations  poss ratting exploration and missioning the only one without a cap on the amount of people that can do it profitably is mission runningso we only have one system in eve that scales properly with subscription growth and you want to break iti swear that the devs must read these threads and not know whether to laugh or crynot supported
so while i agree with what you are trying to do i dont agree with how you are trying to do itmissions and mining in general need to be changed in a way that supports the current play style of a casual player but limits the ability of players to blitz missions limiting the number of missions one can take from an agent is a good start but if you allow infinite numbers of missions to be taken in low sec then that can be farmed as well and at a bigger profit especially if missions are brought up to par with what they should be considering the added risk in low sec and null secif you make mining much more interactive so that macro miners are basically eliminated then you eliminate the mission problem entirely because the massive flow of minerals into the system will be cut in half if not more i bet and though mission running would become more profitable it wouldnt if you reduced the number of npcs and made them harder while removing basic tech 1 loot dropshow to make mining interactive is tough but i would say the first step would be to eliminate belts in high sec completely and make cosmos and missions the only source of minerals and those being very limited in quantity then make mining missions spawn tiny belts in random locations just like combat missions do and force the miners to move around often rather than just set in a belt and macro all day then the miner might not get as much in minerals for hisher time but will get compensated by rewards bonuss and loyalty pointsleave the belts in low sec and 0 as incentive to mine those areas due to easier access of resources that the empires have not already farmed dry it fits from an rp prospective and would make macros much more difficult to program and run you can also include random events like gas pockets and ruptures that cause your lasersstrip miners to turn off or the asteroid to break into two targets rather than one forcing you to target them both anything to increase the work but retain the current total payout for legitimate mining instead of macro mining to reduce the influx of low risk mineral productioni simply would rather attack the root of the problem than plug holes all day long the biggest problem in eve is macro mining and ninja ratting fix those and you will fix a hell of a lot of other problems and there are very good proposals on changing local to make ninja ratting near impossible
yes there is a vast amount of isk being poured into the game but there is isk being poured back out too my friend is about the worst shopper i have ever seen and probably blows half his income buying things and selling them at a loss and gets more domis blown up in missions than anyone i have ever seen i myself dont always run missions and have lost my fair share of ships including two rohks recently amongst a small armada of rifters and blackbirds so again their is a group out there that blitzes missions all day long and generates a massive amount of income with zero losses but not all and without a good study i think you will find that most mission runners dont run more than a hand full of missions and dont account for the huge isk faucet that they can be if abusedyoure confusing isk leaving the game with isk leaving your friends wallet two very different things
its well within the devs powers to scale all of those inherently pvpable activities simply adding more decent truesec 00 space allowin 04 sec moons to be mined increasing the frequency of 00losec exploration sites would all be fine things to do imo
i love this whole risk vs reward crap i see being flung about much like a dead donkey i wonder how many people that are complaining about this have alts that partake in the whole scamming buisness which has 0 risk for all reward setting up dodgy contracts buy orders and running scams on altsyou people also seem to forget that not everyone can commit endless amount of time to go exploring during the week they might get 2 hours a day and maybe some fleet time at the weekend thats it so they cant afford not to have a stable isk income becuase without it they simply wont bother witha sub feefurthermore theres a large portion according to ccp figures the largest portion of eves population that currently engages in these missions so any kind of negative tinkering is going to potentially cost ccp the majority of there income
its amazing how the mission defenders keep using this argument when it is in fact the strongest argument for a nerf that so large a percentage of eve players run these missions many of them despite living in 00 or low sec clearly demonstrates that something is wrong with mission running
your failing to realize the implications of buying something high and selling it lowif i buy a ship for 5 million isk and turn around and sell it for 4 million isk then 1 million isk just left the game never to be seen againif you fail to understand this concept please dont ever invest in stock of any kind less you loose your ass and end up homeless
cant you guys try to come up with something better than the constant ad hominem attacks
lol you do realise that the market is player controlled rightno they cant actually even assuming you are in a great belt with big roids are undisturbed and got maxed mining skills in a hulk you wont compete with a normal mission runner the only positive side of mining in high sec atm is that you can do it largely afk and that its easier to run multiple accounts with it macro mining
storchs deliver babies
it couldnt possibly mean that people enjoy the activity could it almost every single game ever developed has had pve content in it that pve content also constituted about 95 of the actual games themselves the only notable exception i can make off the top of my head is microsofts recent release of shadowrun which failed miserably because a huge portion of a player base wanted pve contentpeople by and large enjoy pve content in games a vast majority of players have no desire to spend their free time hunting other players when they can enjoy pve content also remember their is a vast difference between the rpg play style of pvp and the first person shooter play style of pvp one can be very taxing and difficult while the other is more of a free for all in which any noob with a gun can kill the best player in the game if he gets the drop on him despite rpg aspects of those games rpgs on the other hand create very distinct separations between new players and experienced players and result in a centralization of power behind the long time player base that goes beyond skill and experience of the player into the income level and character level of that player eve falls into a category in which players are segregated by these extremes whether you think it is or not in that situation most casual players are going to go the more intelligent route of playing it safe rather than striking out into the world beyond just to get ownedeve takes this unforgiving stance to an extreme because your loss is actually a loss as oppose to some games where you can pvp without fear of being heavily penalized for losing yes there are games that find a middle ground like wow and everquest but pve is hugely prevalent in those games too yet in its day a game like anarchy online had tons of pvp because the penalties for losing were not harsh there were also mechanisms in that game to protect new players from being assaulted by high level players that further spurred pvp as an aspect of the game from the lowest levels on up there were very good reasons to pvp in that game as well compared to eve where pvp is largely less about gaining anything of value and more about gaining territoryi dont place value on it in eve because 0 and low sec are imho not currently worth more than high sec or just having funthis is a failing not of the casual player who simply wants to enjoy pve content but of ccp to develop a meaningful purpose to pvp and 0 sovereignty people need to stop trying to plug holes and start looking for a solution to whats causing the holes in the first place ninja ratting and macro mining are huge problems and when these were much less prevalent people didnt have a problem with missions thats not to say that missions dont have a problem with giving out too much loot and having too high of rewards in high sec but there are other much larger fish to fry a good look at 0 sovereignty would also be nice since it currently is more of a war of bragging rights than a war over anything worth while
no you lost 1m the 5m you paid is in the person you bought froms wallet the person who bought from you saved 1m more than you did buying something it was money he already had or he couldnt have used it if i buy a friends mining drone for 4bil and sell it for 4k my 4b4k is transfered to his wallet the only isk lost is to taxes from the sale
you have sort of disqualified yourself from further participation in this thread by failing to understand basic economics furthermore all of your longwinded points have already been adressed over and overand overand over againbasically please stop posting
yes your point your assuming that players care about their isk in his case he doesnt and so right click sell item is his 1 method of moving goodsdespite my berating him for it repeatedly and if he wants something he will sell everything he owns to get it if necessary including six 350mm prototype large rail guns that he sold for a loss of around 1 mill each so in effect his frivolity with isk is not only costing him money but costing the economy money because by spending 5 million and only getting 4 back 1 million of that is simply gonebut your assuming that a player is blitzing missions most players are not as i said most players that i know running missions either just kill the stuff or split their firepower between weapons and salvagetractor on tier 1 bss yes you can grab a maurader and farm the crap out of missions but thats not the fault of the high sec mission runner thats the fault of ccp for making a ship thats optimal role is farming missions and ninja rattingplease stop lumping every mission runner in with those that abuse the system there will always be those that push the limits to the max and cause problems but to nerf them would be to nerf a vast majority of the populations fun activities as well as i said i have no problem with limiting the number of missions you can get from an agent but limiting it to 1 is overboard and allowing infinite in 0 will simply move mission farming to 0also just because macro mining can be done doesnt mean its an acceptable practice to say mission running is less risky than mining is ridiculous because its only less risky to a small portion of the population that gear themselves for maximum profit as oppose to the casual player who may wont fly around in a ship fitted with billion dollar modules because they cant afford itsomeone posted that they could easily handle everything thrown at them in a tech 2 fitted cyclone and make 60mill an hour but they admitted that they were also running optimal missions to make that much and overstated the amount of bounty and reward by rounding everything upwards so best case scenario the person made 50 mill an hour but that wasnt average that was a bs heavy mission which consequently has better loot and salvage while most missions dont have a majority of bss and most mission runners dont cherry pick their missions and only run wcs and aes i would also love to see that cyclone solo an ae bonus room fitted only with tech 2 mods without warping out repeatedly due to the massive dps in that roomi am not saying missions cant be tweaked but as i said before your trying to plug holes instead of look at underlying problems
seriouslyi mean i could almost forgive you the first time but now you have cemented the fact that you dont really understand how this game workslet me make it really simple you buy a ship for 5 mil iskyou sell said ship for 4 mil iskyour net loss is 1 mil iskdoes that 1 mil isk disappearno lets look closeryou buy a ship for 5 mil isk 5 mil isk is payed into my me being the seller accountyou sell said ship to pete for 4 mil isknow you have 1 mil less isk than you started withi have 5 mil more isk and one less ship than i started withpete has 4 mil less isk and one more ship than he started withget it
thats great and all but 1 mill isk is still lost if you buy a tool and never use it and sell it for less than what you paid for it its a net loss to the entire economy so my friend with no large railgun skills got no return on his investement and sold it at a loss therefore earning a net loss for the economyjust so you know a net loss is when your expenses exceed your incomei am not talking about a capital loss or a transfer of income because again your assuming that the person is actively trying to maintain a semblance of prudent spending he isnt being forced to sell at a loss he is choosing to do so the net difference is a loss despite one person saving money and one person making money the third person lost money that money is simply gone its a forced depreciation of value to the object by the seller
um watdo you not understand that although you are 1m poorer you have made some other player 1m richerisk has left your wallet but it has not left the gamewait you are aware that the market is basically all stuff that other players are buying and selling right if you didnt know that then some of the major issues with hisec missioning might not have made sense to youexcept skillbooks pos and trade goods
um i think you should stop talking about economics you have seriously confused money in your game with money in the eve economy
do you understand the concept of depreciation max you know the thing that is happening to the value of minerals since the game started and people have started macro mining en mass they are not placing value on their time like they would in real life so they are forcing the value of the item down to continually undercut their competition and move their product faster this results in lower prices for everything manufactured using those goods so by buying something high and selling it low its taking a loss boone pickens recently lost about 10 million dollars when he sold his stock in yahoo at a loss no one made money from that deal no one gained anything that didnt already existits like a baseball card say you have the only known copy of a hank aaron rookie card that is autographed well that card is worth say 100k if someone buys that card from you for 100k and then another card is found that person will now have lost money because the value of the card will go down the assets value depreciated however if the person simply sells the card for less than 100k that person still lost money its a net loss the card should have retained its original value but no matter how many times it is sold again someone in there lost money that isnt recouped ever
were not talking about the stock market here precious every time you click sell you sell the item to another player no money gets lost the money you pay goes into his wallet same when you sell something money goes from the buyers wallet into yours its amazing that you know so many big words yet fail to realize this simple fact
risk vs reward works just fine in missions id say it is even on a better scale than 00 npcingyou are mixing 2 things1 npc generated risk  compensated by bounties and mission reward loot loyalty points standing etc this always works as it should you get same amount of isk for same difficulty npcs well not directly but in total yes check out the 00 belt bs bounty and same name mission bs bounty usualy the mission bs is 23 or so of the same 00 belt bs2 player generated risk  never taken into account in anything because this is a self regulating system however it is constrained by boundaries of security status and concord player generated risk is an autobalancing system because it works only with limited resources that are completely tied to the player driven market mods ships minerals etcyou cannot compare highsec missions to 00 ratting by player generated risks because they work in 2 completely different systems of mechanicsbut if you want a selfregulated system for missions start with agent quality make it dynamic so that overcrowding an agent will force people to migrated to better offerings this way you have created a resource that is actualy influenced by player activity that limits the agent system evereybody will be happy in this waysome notes on your exploration missions and other things1 you cannot move missions to exploration based because exploration is not guaranteed to produce content this would allienate casual players that like to spend 12 hours a day on missions to relax a bit after work you know rl this kind of players need instantly accessible content that generates some rewards for their time spent and does not have high requirements on time invested2 00 ratting is at least on equal level to l4 missions in isk income your question as to why then people dont gravitate to 00 has a simple answer rl requirements 00 is much more taxing on time spent and planning not everybody can spend that much time most if not all alliances have rules on alliance ops and active timeduties etc this is the biggest hurdle to master for casual players3 mission running is the only significant isk generator all the other activities either only turn isk around in the economy or generate very little isk severely limiting missions would have a very adverse effect on the game making it harder on time spent to achieve goals isk again allienating casual playersany way you look at the issue you cannot simply wreck missions with your kind of proposal there are changes possible to make the system work better or more interesting but those are not the kind you asked for
ahhh no we are talking about the same thing but different valuesi am however wrong about him directly removing isk from the system though he does have a negative impact on it its not in the way i was thinkingi am not saying that 1 million actual isk left the game just that the value item being sold for less than its value removes isk indirectly by lowering the value of the item overall or should i say the need for isk hence my references to depreciation the result being depreciation in the price of items isk isnt directly removed but less isk is required if the activity continues while isk is still being pumped into the system at the same rate as it was when prices were higher this is a problem but thats why i agreed with the idea of removing tech 1 loot drops and removing npcs but making them harder with better bountiesif you remove the materials such as ore loot salvage etc the value of those items will increase and more isk will be spent on those items and you wont have the problems of seeing missioning as more valuable as miningsorry about that i was wrong to say isk itself is leaving the economy from that transaction
i refuse this it will force people to go into 00 that they dont want to it will effect the game a lot some people just like to mission run and have fun and enjoy the game why would you ruin someones experience just because you are fed up with some farmers also putting most of the agents in low sec will make mission runners life a hell hardly anyone will be running missions and such and limiting the amount of missions one can run a day is also stupid some people spend more then 4 hours a day running missions lvl 4 missions help players who need money to get the big ships to go out in 00 this will lose a lot of players who like empire and dont like to fight i high disagree on this

three thumbs up here
but how does one have 3 thumbsthe idea is mindboggling omg he must be ome kind of freaknot supported coz i like being all nicey nicey and play girly happy day tea parties were no naughty words are allowed
just kidding had yas fooled p
oh no kids reading swearwords the imbeciles who decided to censor these letters did they ever bother to think of what kids are exposed to in the media or around them in general getting teased for their appearance weight clothing etc  while being exposed to underweight role models and watching humanity eradicate itself because of political and religious ideologiesno we have to censor these words becasue clearly those will be the end of our childrengive me a ing break
the day that pvp combat between missionrunners and pirates is balanced is the day i would consider supporting making probing missions easier the problem is that its not just the pirate gank squad against a missionrunner its the pirate ganksquad and 50 npcs against the missionrunner with the npcs ignoring the pirates entirely heck the pirates dont even need a scram or webs small hordes of npc frigs will handle that for them in some cases the npcs even handle ew for the pirates as wellfix this and id consider supporting the idea
being a pirate and one that can use scan probe ships all i can say is bm bm bm bm
the playerbase average age of eve may be older than other mmos but ive always pondered how eve fairs in terms of maturity level unfortunately it seems comments like the one quoted above are becoming more and more common in eve and they do absolutely no justice to the reputation it creates among us players quite sad really
thumbs upexlegion ftw
tempest woha
as a long time modeller absolutelyhopefully itll be an additional revenue stream for ccp as well
maybe not forfeit the lp or standing but simply dont list them if they are normal or below anything in the lp storeeven a check box for settings would be greati dont want to list anyone that i have standing with that is considered normal and i also dont need to know i have 4 lp points in an agent i used once two years ago
while im not sure i would want an option to forfeit my standingslp i would kill for an option to hide them when i open that part of my character pagejust needs a simple settings page with three sections one for factions one for corporations and one for agents with the same options available for eachcheckbox do not show standings of this typecheckbox show standings above user input box and below user input boxcheckbox show all standingsso for example i might want to see all my standings for factions view all but only my standings for corporations ive done reasonable amounts of work for or have annoyed enough that diplomacy wont get me back into positive standings 30 or higher20 or lower and couldnt care less about my standings with individual agents hide all
id prefer if there would be corporate roles and charisma based skills to negotiate exchange of standings and consolidating lp through the work of good corporate management something to encourage people to pick corporations with good management
how about the ability to give lps to other people
now that is an interesting idea
that would be part of the corporate management capabilities corporate representatives negotiating redistribution within the corporation trades expulsion of records and such
eh i liek the idea kind of but it might open up a whole can of worms
nononoomfg the farmers are already cranking out faction missiles as fast as 5 men can run a level 4 do you want them to transfer their lp back and forth at will
how about in the corporation anyone joining known farmer outfits to buy these services would certainly be blacklisted by us at least

the purpose of hics was scrambling supercapitals with this change they could not do so thus i am opposed also i dont really care about blockade runners and their complaints every strategy should have a counter that doesnt require jumping through ridiculous hoops and hics countering stabs is a good example of this
hmm that was unintended perhaps the hic scramble could be hardwired such that they still scramble supercaps while still allowing the other changesin any event the main purpose of the change is to add a highslot tackle modeled after the warp dis gen that is usable my shield tankers can we agree that is worth supporting
as someone who does alot of trading i find it to be a pain in the ass when modifying buy and sell orders so to make it a little easier and less time consuming i had the following ideacould we have a  and  button added to the popup box when you click to modify an order that increasesdecreases the price you have setthanks
increases it by what increment it almost has to be 001 but thats utterly useless outside of jitawell hubs generally fights i think typing in a number is about the only way
i was thinking a seperate input field where you can type in what increments you want
issuewith the introduction of hictors  and with them a infinite point warp disruptor that works in lowsec  the costbenefit ratio of warp core stabilizers has changed dramatically whereas a transport pilot used to have to decide between fitting cargohold expanders nanofibers for faster aligning and wcs for safety  each with its own advantages and disadvantages  the introduction of hictors has made wcss almost obsoleteproposali suggest adding another bonus to wcss  increased warp speed this would benefit haulers by reducing trip time and give them some added safety while traveling since they would be moving faster at warp than their pursuers it would also make hyperspatial velocity optimizer rigs more useful by adding a module that stacks with their effects in all it would give transport pilots more options and thus more enjoyment while making warp core stabilizers useful againthis may have some synergy with an idea i posted regarding a change to warp disruption field gens
a useless and counterintuitive buff on a module still effective against 95 of tacklers ill pass
i dont see hows it is a useless change  with say a 1525 boost in warp speed per module  rigs an itty v might actually manage to boost its warp velocity by 300 that would increase transport pilot iskhr and help them to evade opponents who might otherwise take advantage of a haulers slow alignment speed to catch up with him at the next gate
we need a new subforum to show the minutes of each csm meeting stickied and locked so that we can just go there to see whats going on with the csm currently tracking down the minutes for the meetings is quite difficult
i noticed in the game that it takes meany jumps to get anywhere and though there are some major economic systsems that there is no major shipping lanes no corperation owned galaxiesplantes and no interplanetary war all of which would happen if there was ever to be a galatic civilizations and factions just as on earth we have continetal war for growing countries to intercontinental war there should most deffinatly be interplantitary warfare in implimenting interplanitary war you can provide nearly an infinte ammount of new game experience new items such as fake ships blockading planets to whole systems of planets player corperation owned planets pvp battles for blockades and the like first and formost in the initiation of this new warfare you will need to first streamline the trade and shipping lanes i have noticed that there are no definite shipping lanes between systems and galaxies through to other factions i propose that you execute a multi tiered system that will allow for faster travel between the outskirts of a region to its capitalwich should also be the economic capital of that region i would suggest that you make classification tierstier 1 systems that are the outskirtshave a jumpgate to a tier 2 systemtier 2 systems systems have military instalations to proctect from invasion from outlaying systems  jumpgate to tier 3 other tier 2 and tier 1 also from here you need to limit the jumpgates to tier 3 to only a few this will cause a funneling effect and the beginnings to shipping lanestier 3 about 35 gates to tier 2 no gates to tier 1 gates to other tier 3 and gates to tier 4 some defence around tier 2 gatestier 4 contains the capital economic hub and has gates to all tier 3now the jumpgates between the tiers may jump across multiple galaxies thus you would need to desighn a new gateafter this feature has been implimented you can then in the tier 1 systems need to provide a reason for their to be industrial ships so i would suggest that you allow corperations to own and occupy these systems there me an increased ammount of mineable astroids planets that can bu occupied by corperations and such if all goes right you should hive a feature that looks like a river delta a main stream to the many branches it hasthe concepts for these can be seen in the blockade of starwars the interplanetary war of the chorincles of riddick and in general any study of nation formingthis is not quite all of my idea but alas i must goi will soon post on the interplanetary warcapsuleer michael curtis aka zolar vemail  ngrtype31h491aolcomif you would like the long version or more details emial me
bravo for creativity some tweaking required for application to eve cluster thoughwhile i may not completely agree with your vision i support the premise of more discussion on this topic however i believe related discussions are currently taking place at less of a macro level than youve described here in other words you may have to rethink or further explain how your ideas will affect individual parts of eve for them to gain approval please see forums features and ideas discussion
i dont like this idea as it prevents you from having safe warp bookmarks to use as you exit the station
warning large amount of text bewarei know i konw it has been brought up a million times but im goign to bring it up again honestly alot of people are saying that fw is going to die off unless there is a reason to capture systems other than bragging rights there has to be an advantage somehowhere is a few ideas i had and others have had as wellsentry guns  station guns fire on the enemy of the occupying force after 20 seconds enough for a battleship to align and gtfo  it would help get fights off of gates i think it would be cool to fight over a planet or in a full asteroid belt since no one mines in low sec would be a nice change of scenery and would also reduce lag less people would want to be in an asteroid belt due to problems like bumping into asteroids or whatnot so it would flesh out battles alot more that would be cool instead of having a 100 vs 100 fight on a gate you could have like 4 or 5 2025 vs 2025 battles throughout a system and perhaps even more than that i think system lag would be reduce quite a bit as i said you could have 150 vs 150 fights and there would probably be the same amount of lag as their might be in dodixie which can be bearable i get this because while there might not be 250 people in dodixie all running missions there might be 100 or so but each mission has like 20 rats or more and i think it is safe to say that 300 people fighting in different locations probably make less than but at the most no more than dodixie does w all its ratsit would add a tactical challenge to fcs because they would split up their fleets in different locations and move forces around the system to where they are needed group a is getting its ass kicked so they send 3 or 4 people from group c that is pwning enemy group c to help out w group anot being able to dock up in a system occupied by the enemy its obvious isnt it if someone has to go they can create a safepot in like a minute or two and log in a safespot or they can simply log out of the game and hope that when they relog they dont warp into a pirate camp or whatever it would provide a danger to being in a system thats not owned by you  your friends today on milita channel a fellow milita was saying of how he was shot at by the minmatar navy while defending a plex or something like that in their space they really need to make the militias blue to each other and make plexing interracial  i havent captured that many plexes so sorry if this is wrong  but make it so if the matar capture lets say tama or something like that it would be captured for the gallente and if the gallente caputred huola it would be captured for the minmatar ect we are allies afterall why cant we lend a hand w out getting shot atthis next idea is kidna crazy and complicated so sorry if it is but here goesi think they should make it so you can call for reinforcments in low sec fw systems heres how it would work each system has a static navy fleet in it for whoever occupies that system something like maybe 6 battleships 10 battlecruisers 14 cruisers 20 frigs and 20 dessies now this fleet can be called upon to help w combat lets say there is a gallente fleet of 10 vs a caldari fleet of lets say 20 the galente are obviously outguned sooo people can call for npc reinfrcments there would have to be a limit though like an aegis cmmndr can call a larger portion of the npc fleet to their aid than lets say a federation minuteman but everyone can call them if they need that way if the gallente are serisoulsy outgunned they can all call for reinforcmnts and their portion of the reinforcmnts would be called out to help and so would whoever else who called for reinforcments and it would build depending on how many the fc asks for everyone to call there would also be a limit to like 2 a day at most and agn your rank would have alot to do wit
and another thing if there is a spike of call for reinforcments something like 20 people calling for reinforcments on the same grid the entire npc fleet will spawn to that location regardless if its a fleet of federation minutemen because its obvious they need helpim not sure who could call what though but i will try im going to use gallente milita ranks since im most familiar w themfederation minuteman  guardian lieutenantwhen you call for reinforcments you get 2 cruisers 3 frigs and 3 dessies to come to your aidlieutenant sentinel  shield commander when you call for reinforcments you get 2 battlecruisers 2 cruisers and 4 frigs to come to your aidaegis commander  major general fwhen you call for reinforcments you get 1 battleship 3 battlecruisers 2 cruisers and 2 dessies to come to your aidlieutenant general  luminaire generalwhen you call for reinforcments you get 2 battleships 3 battlecruisers and 2 cruisers to come to your aidok it would work like this and could keep happeneing as long as the fleet is still there and there are numbers to draw from now if the numbers run out if a higher ranking general calls for aid his call will be answered over someone of a lower rank if he needs itnow another mechanic that would have to be put in would be one to prevent people from abusing it you konw like calling for a fleet of ships on a gate so you could help lock down the system w npcs no that wouldnt do ok when the npcs spawn assuming they dont die if there is no enemy activity in their area lets say an area of 100km if there is no enemy activity in say 2 minutes the npcs despawn and are healed a little bit like their tank is recharged and will continue to recharge as long as it isnt attacked just like mission rats now of course the npcs are destroyable you take a faction hit as if they were part of a plex or it could be a set amount battleships give you a 2 or something battlecruisers a 15 cruisers a 1 frigs  dessies a 05 ect and give you sec increases for your faction 1 per battleship 05 for a battlecruiser  035 for a cruiser  025 for frigs dessies ect nothing to dramatic maybe even lower the nubmers even more than that or make low sec navy rats even tougher to kill since i guess i could see somone hunting for 50 battleships to kill for a full 100 w the caldari navy or somethingyou cant scan down the navy npcs this would prevent people from farming them for their tags which they would carry or for standings whoringok another crazy idea but heard it on another thread but changed it up a bitok we all in fw know that you have that stupid ibis sitting on the gate we all konw he is a freaking spy but we cant pop him and his pod unless we are willing to take a sec hit for the ship and  or pod if your quick and sit out of the fleet for 15 minutes basically if your faction occupies the system you can shoot anyone except fellow milita members and your allies and you dont get the sentry guns on you but you still take a sec status hit if you shoot a milita member you do get sentry guns and sec faction hit personally i think you should be kicked for shooting another milita member but that is another thread for tomorrow lol you konw the warning they put up when your about to enter a low sec system maybe they could add to that message and say     warning you are about to enter a low sec system and concorde cant gurantee yoru safety there and then another warning after that if you have them on another warning could also pop up that says warning you are entering a volatile warzone and may be percieved as a danger to the empires fighting there are you sure you wish to proceed this warning would be another pop up after the low sec warning pop up and it can be turned off as welli konw the whole thing sounds like a far
far fetched but they are ok good ideas and would make fw a bit more bearable and fun and give more than just braggin rights there is still the reward factor that needs to be decided as well buuuut someone else can figure those out    unless i think of some first lolalso guys if you agree w most of the ideas but not some of them please still give the support factor and tell me what you disagree w and why and what could be done to make it better i really want to save fw it needs more depth and i love purging the galaxy of the rebellious caldari and want to hopefully continue to do so in a few months but if its starts dropping numbers rapidly because there is no depth i wont be able to easily fight w them
normally im prowall of text but you really have to proofread it and make it wellwritten for it to be bearable as for your actual ideas a few make sense but most dont npc reinforcements spawning seems counter to the whole methodology of fw for example i dont participate in it so i dont know the merits of a lot of these suggestions but on the whole they dont seem very good
ok i can understand the reinforcment thing as i said that was probably the most crazy idea but as the title points out there need to be benefits to fw other than just bragging rights when you capture a systemthe sentry guns and station docking idea are all common on militia chat because it is rather stupid that i can dock up in the state protectorate factory right on the border of caldari high security and own like a stockpile of ships thereand the idea of being able to shoot anyone in low sec w out sentry gun fire it was origianlly in another thread about how fw systems should all be anyone can shoot anyone w out any penalty and i figured that was a tick to much so i figured ok your fighting for the state the military will cut you some slack rp kicking in the military will cut you some slack because you shot someone who was more than likely a spy you were defending your empire or something so they arent going to have their sentry guns shoot you buut concord is the one that adjusts sec status and you did shoot a neutral so you still lose sec statusit would just be a ton easier to be able to shoot that dam person we know is a spy w out having to sit out of the fleet for 15 minutes and take a sec hit as well
how about a method of accessing the gatestation sysems the docking control center or jumpgate control center and tell them to force the spy neutral to warp to another object or activate the gate and automatically jump them thruif theyre sitting on an fw complex gate they should be fair game no sec hit no aggression timer just being on the grid makes them enemy to anyone from either faction party that warps to that gateif theyre at a station they get forcefuly docked and cant undock for 60 seconds or they get warped to another stationgate if theyre at a gate they get jumped to the destination system or warped to another stationgateif this happens often enough the neutral is flagged as a hostile agent to the npc corp and the gunspolice will start actively harassing them
im not entirely sure if this subject has be brought to the attention of csm or the devs before but id like to see the option to be able to have your alliance and or corporation logo display on the hull of any ship you ownbuyproducethose who have played rts games like homeworld 2 would know that you have the option to upload images which in turn you can use as ship badgesyet i wouldnt know what kind of load this would cause on the server and how to practically run the idea i thought it would be a nice finishing touch to see the signifier of an alliance or corp painted onto the side of the ship models rather than just looking through show infoanyone else agreedisagree
actually as long as this was an optional display setting it wouldnt cause that much lag for people with vaguely good connections i imagine that the corp logos are sent as a single packet containing the settings for each of the options background forground decor colours etc so it would not really increase the server load significantlysupported
yeah would make a nice small additionthere is also something else i have noticed not related to the topic of this thread but would be interested to see if others noticedim assuming everyone is familiar with the slighlt blueish shield effect around a shield tanked ship when the hardeners are active im sure others have realised that when a shield tanked ship takes agression the real time graphic shows the damage to be taken on the hull of the ship not deflected by the shield animation itselfwould there be any sort of fix to this i know im being picky but im always fond of a sense of realism p
i likesignedps hw2 ftw
yeh the aliens are a bit clichem but hey these are only ideas the main emphasis would be to enhance exploration and it might be a way of adding storylines or lore
t2 transports arent supposed to be bigger than t1 merely better one has warp stabs one has massive resists admittedly dsts tend to suck which is why there was a proposal a while back to make them jumpable via black ops bridging but bigger is not the goal here
fixed your postmy point was ecm was effectively removed as a utility module from everyone and given to caldari and mother ship specialized pilotsif strength and capacitor use along possibly with cpu were increased and ecm was made into more of a cruiser sized niche itd improve a lot of ship lineups and give diversity to small gangs that fit out differant ewar might need tweeking with the already specialized caldari jammer ships so the smaller versions can still use them effectively however as is there is no reason for nonecm bonused ships to fit ecm there would be more reason for smaller gangs to also incorporate remote sensor damps and gangs wont always be max speed  damage  tank  numbersthere will always been additional benefits for using the specialized versions but it adds a wildcard factor for cruisers and smaller groups
a stopgap thought comes to mind  get ccp to bring back proclamations use it as your forum  even if you get a bit of player chatter it shouldnt interfere with your publicbutcloseddiscussionforum functionality also itd let all the meeting results threads go somewhere instead of cluttering the assembly hall
not being funny or anything but if i look at this forum and see which threads are on the first page by you they are1 streamlining the council for better communication with ccp2 redefining the chairman position3 what should change in the csm 4 increasing transparency by streamlining communicationi cant remember seeing any of these issues in assembly hall so they appear to be personal issues raised by you rather than the general eve populace the only one that seemed to get any measure of support was the 3rd one what should change in the csm everything else seems to be about adding an extra layer of unecessary buracracy in an attempt to justify your position even the thread which had the most responsessupport the what should change in the csm thread was mostly about reducing timewastage by having the meeting as a voting meeting with the discussionsproposals taking place before the actual meeting take place and that anyone asking for an explanation of the proposals is a complete failure of a csm for not doing their homework beforehandim not sure what your campaign promise was but at the moment it looks like your spending all your efforts on issues that are personal to you and which have little to no effect on the general eve populace as they arent on the csm and mostly seem to involve changing howwhat the csm is responsible for rather than anything actually relevent to everyone else
well i dont think you quite understand exactly what the purpose of those threads are its merely discussion threads and im hardly spending all my efforts on it since they are not in the assembly hallwhich is by design i do not wish to raise them for the csm you can call it fuss or whatever but its all just thoughts of minethough often based on community feedback which i thought might be interesting to discuss if there was broad support and consensus it might be raised to the assembly hall but that is a long way offi have stood for the industry and i have raised a ton of issues about that as well as other topics which has nothing to do with industry but was a great concern for the players im even working on more issues which i hope to get raised for our third meeting with ccpi have been busy over the last month so havent had too much time to write up issues its fairly likely that i will have a bunch of issues written up for our meeting in a bit over a week from now i have a handful that just needs polishingyou will also see if you head over to the market discussion forum and have a look trough the forum we have had extensive discussion about issues which has been raised by the csm as well as discussing the result of it right now one of the major things that the csm need to do is to shape the role of the council and decrease player apathy nobody else has taken on this task so it is of course my intention with those posts to try and gather feedback and get discussion on how to shape the council to the better and i have gained tons of good feedback on it
call me a cynic but anyone can put issues onto the assembly hall or come up with ideas good or badcan you tell us how many successfully escalated isues you have managed so faradditionally it might be helpful to list them as issuesideas of your own and those on behalf of others ie adopted from assembly halltake carearithron
i have raised 12 issues some of which werent posted by me in the assembly hall forum every single one of them were successfully escalatedbut what does that have to do with anything do you want to compare epeens or what seems fairly damn silly to me
i like specificsthings like i have raised tons makes me nervous dont get me wrong you actually discuss things in the forums and are doing what you said you would be my concern with communication and the csm is not that the right tools arent there but that csm members wouldnt use them even if they were there hence why id like to see a weekly issue meeting in addition to the voting meetings so that discussion of current issues could occur and refinement of issues to be presented could occurtake carearithron
fair nuff
read that again
hmm yea i missed that old eyessorry lia
i agree they should just disappear set amount of time and just say that the pos since it was unfueled fell into a decaying orbit and eventually crashed into the moon
without any role in sov sovspamming poss will be no problemthe issue im getting at is if you cap a planet that has a nice moon and you want to go mine it should you then have to blow up the pos the old boring way whats the point of sov if you cant control what structures can be anchored at your planetjust trying to ensure the old pos system doesnt linger as an effective way to block moons poss are easier to blob so if you cap a planet using brilliant tactics you will be at much less of an advantage in the pos system a blobby boring defender might choose to give up the planetary bases and just block the moons with their poss and keep miningthe old pos needs to be subservient to the new planetary defense system question is whats a good mechanic for getting rid of them
in low sec and npc 00 it forces people to raise standing with npc factions to see whos in local not fun in deep 00 more pos stuff bleah not supported
role specific ships and the ability to rent intel pretty sure he already said thatgives people the upper hand if its their home
nice idea but i think youve gone far far too overboard discussing specifics features and ideas is the forum of initial ideas and discussion it is better to post there discuss it refine it and get it in such a format to present here that already covers the ins and outs and therefor comes to a straight show of support
i agree t2 ammo needs buffs but it is still cheaper than faction ammo production time is nice to talk about but according to the market it doesnt seem to matter much
federation navy antimatter charges do 552 damage50 optimal rangevoid t2 shortrange blaster charges do 56 damage25 optimal50 tracking50 falloff25 capacitor usewhy in the world would any sane person ever use void ammo it gives a massive 145 damage increase over faction antimatter but makes your guns miss every shot theres just no reason to ever use it heck even if you dont run missions you can just buy faction ammo off a contract
its significantly cheaper does a tiny bit more damage and has a better optimal if youre expecting the target to be webbed down to nothing void is actually significantly better than cnam on most fits of course expecting a target to be webbed down to nothing is a prediction that nothing whatsoever will go wrong meaning its a fairly dumb bet most people dont take but it can be a good idea in a handful of circumstances now i agree that most t2 ammos need a serious buff of one variety or another thats really not in dispute but my point was just that added production time is not a concern because if it was then itd be reflected in the market price of the ammos and its not void is cheaper therefore its easier to produce
incorrect by a huge marginvoid is cheaper and takes 500x the time to producecn antimatter small can be produced by the 1015k lot in the time it takes to run 1 lvl 4 mission producing a single run of void s with a researched bpo takes at least 4 hourst2 ammos need to be unnerfed in a big way andor made to be considerably distinct when placed sidebyside with nont2 analogues oror mind youput nerfs on faction ammo
wrong herschel sell price reflect only what people is willing to payproducing t1 ammunition with the same production slot can give better return sometime producing quake l with a researched bpo give less than 900k day and searching for the best market in several regions producing antimatter l with the same slot and selling it without even leaving the station give 1140000 day 27 more isk with less work as you can see the buyer dictate the ammunition price not the seller so the sell price is not influenced by the production timeedit note with give i am speaking of the gain you make after all cost are calculated not the raw isk you get from the sales raw isk for the quake are approximately 2400000 for the antimatter 3550000
faction ammo is inline with other faction items ie being the same stats as t2 but none of the drawbacks faction ammo is also similarly much more expensive than t2 ammohowever ammo is cheap faction ammo to someone who pvps is very cheap so the price doesnt matter so you are basically using a t1 item and throwing around faction quality into it thus obsoleting t2 short range ammo even long range t2 ammo the faction t1 has so much better tracking it is worth a looki think most veteran players are a bit upset because it was long the standard that you need t2 weapons because t2 ammo is so awesome a few nerfs later and faction ammo added and it is uhhh where did my t2 advantage go now i guess this is a boost for new players with lower skills but the 210 spec bonus you get from t2 guns over t1 for guns that are harder to fit is what i get hmmmmm well at least t2 is cheaperpersonally i think faction ammo was given to be the star item when lp stores came out and possibly a boost to missile boats that usually shunned t2 ammo not a whole lot of balancing was thought out when ccp released faction ammo where are my republic fleet cap booster 800 charges and my faction dictor bubbles come on i wants them
add true faction drones and not those things that come rarely from the drone regions
does anyone actually use damage t2 ammo range sure  but damage
who defined easier as takes less time theres a hundred other concepts that need to be considered besides merely production time most notably opportunity cost  by producing faction ammo youre giving up the ability to produce faction gear or implants those tend to be less profitable but not by too much if you look around meaning the economic profit of faction ammo is not all that high also venkul if antimatter produces more isk per day for less effort than quake i ask what kind of  is still producing quake antimatter bpos are dirt cheap and its not hard to switch over production either sell quake for an economic profit or stop making it  i have no pity for you whatsoever if youre inflicting an economic loss upon yourself to win back sunk costs
all t2 ammo needs to be balancedthe t2 high damage rage torpedoes actually do less than basic t1 torps they have 600 m signature 5 to cap regeneration across the ship and 100 ms velocityonly javelin torps have clear advantage over cn torpedoes 350 m sig 50 more speedbut cn torps with dual painters still do more damage to all targets so i dont even bother with t2 torpedoes siege launchers ii  cn navy torps ftw
if you think faction ammo is so profitable go grind thatt2 ammo has specific uses for general use use t1 and faction if you can affordt2 does has never meant best possible item
i agree but at least the naglfar isfreakinvertical
possible solutions to citadel torpedo issue1 citadel torps beforeafter siege cycle do 0 damageto prevent the fire and hide exploit add a piece of code in the siege module to disallow entering siege mode inside pos shields and fix a dreads location in space to disallow bumping back into pos after siege  fire there is no point entering siege mode in a pos anywaysfor the similar modules changes can possibily be done too who enters triage mode in a pos shield similar changes can be done but there is no much point doing it the industrial core is fine as it is just leave it 2 citadel torps easily destroyed by smartbombsmissile destruction should be in the domain of defender missiles leave smartbombs out of the equation they are for drones  fightersthe simple solution to this is simple ooops  increase the hp of all missiles by 10 folds increase the damage of defender missiles by 10 foldsthis will allow the defender missiles to do its job while leaving missiles close to unkillable to smartbombs smartbombs wont be affected as they can still kill drones and fightersthese issues affect 2 out of total 4 dreads in eve and possibily those who decide to mount citadel torp launchers on their titans please get this fixed or at least gives us a reply asapjust my 2 cents milia jenius

100 support to citadel torp hp boostbtw it only takes 2 named smartbombs to pop a sieged citadel torp last time i was playing around in sisi i was able to completely block out phoenixes by just cycling 2 smartbombs and taking out the torps as they came 
the bos were made to be a pvp ship pls for the love of all that is holy just make them into a pirate dream ship whats the worst that can happen they dont have the dps to stand up to a normal fleet so they pretty much are a niche ship unfortunatly ccp decided that people using them to jump 25 ly to go gang  miners was a bad idea so we are now stuck with gate camp running shipsyou want to bring back the pvp into eve these ships need to be put into combat and not have to bring a freighter along to do it fuel wise noah ccp indicated that ccp was aware that battleships with jumpdrives would become the ultimate ship and to this end black ops ships were prenerfedas they are now they are the ultimate jokethey need 1 bonus set on skills to jump range no more than 45 systems but make them consume less fuel2t2 ship needs t2 resist 3 cloak while warpingim a little onesided in my veiws as i want them for jumping past the dual mom camped system and make a beeline for where my target is mining fleets dont need these and probaly wouldnt make great use of them unless they could go past a cyno jammerbut im sure a few pirates could come up with a few ideas about using them
absolutely
do the above so we can effectively do the below  now they will have purpose
nerf is rather tarded to put it inna civil way
great idea i want to see my capitals go  way my bsbc go  way and my other ships go  way

u4 was great when gf lived their people did missions because their was to much competition for rats it is also npc space so you can do missions but remember a whole lot of us live in the supposedly lucrative player controlled space that does not have missions
well of course its based on my experience and that of other people its also based on maths a good system below 05 gives rats with bounties varying from 200k  15 mil if you are by your self in such a system with 10 belts you should be able to clear each belt about once an hour lets say each belt gives you on average 3mil that would give you 30mil an hour this is in a good system with no competition and with no interruptions now lets add those well throw in just one other ratter that effectively halfs your iskh so with maths and common sense i have shown why 00 ratting generally meaning unless youre lucky is worse than level 4 mission runningif you took it as uncontrovertible fact without exception youre pretty stupid just saying everything has exceptionsno its not an argument as in these debates most of the people arguing against the nerf pipe up and say but all i wanna do is run missions again the general mass seems to enjoy mission running youre the exceptionthe holes in my position is made up of exceptions several of which you happen to be part of im not saying youre lying im just saying youre extremely luckyi did not present my statement as an absolute you took it as such in order to be able to pick it apart i have provided said proofno you nitpicked on parts of my arguments never managing to refute a single one good going
i noticed you also cleverly assumed that all mission runners have no understanding of the directional scanner or of how to survive in lowsec the only time i have ever lost a ship to plexing in lowsec the closest thing to missions i do there is when i forgot to keep my scanner open even then it took 5 ships to kill 2 dominixes pve fit and we killed one of their falcons net loss for us approx 80 mill my friend was rigged net loss for them approx 100 mill even assuming that the mission runners get caught  you will probably be dealing with at least 2 pirates per mission runner kill 1 to probe 1 to kill probably more also the idea of flying a golem without adequate scanning ability is frankly laughable and they deserve to be out of pocket by several hundred milljust one little hint  you might not want to fly officer fitted cnrs in lowsec
only goonswarm showed support so the whole topic is bull
imnot goonswarm and neither are most of the other people supporting this maybe you should start arguing the issue instead of calling names might bring more light to your cause
bad ideathumbs downnot supported if youre gonna buff lowsec and nullsec then fineif you nerf high sec then eve loses lots of subscribers  bad for game development and bad for the future of eve
the op is an idiot and did not do a single lvl 4 mission in his life just another stupid goon idea posted just because they can lets nerf trading and production and invention and oh moon mining those activities are no risk as well but who cares  the avarage lvl 4 mission yields about 1015 milh in a normal ship up to 25 mil per h in a uber fitted faction ship but then again the op is a goon how can he know what is more nerf missioning and what you end up with  more miners because its the second choice for making money with the patter of investing your own time to make isk also a thing brought by many others lvl 3 in low sec who will do them  lvl 4 yield too little money to be profitable in low sec not to mention lvl 3
one of the main problems with these arguments are that no one considers the focus of empire lowsec and 00in my view empire is geared towards solo or small groups lowsec towards bigger groups and 00 is geared towards large corporationsalliances that isnt to say that these are the only types of play that can work in those areas but that certain types of play are just more suited to different areasbalancing the income of 00 ratting and mission running is a great concept but it avoids the idea that both are solo activities while 00 is a group oriented endeavor to truly compare profitability you need to look at scale 1000 mission runners banding together in empire will only make 1000x as much there is no increase on return 1000 pvp pilots banding together in 00 will not only get the same potential income from ratting but also significant increases in corporationalliance income due to moon mining etc with much more logistical support requiredoverall the potential for profit per person is much higher in 00 when corporation funds are included in the calculation leave mission runners alone casual mission runners spend a bit of time here and there and most of it goes into pimping out their ship this is good for the economy as it increase volume of trade and gives 00 people a source for their t2 market and faction mods removing level 4s will just move these people down to level 3s they wont suddenly decide to alter their playstyle and move into lowsec or 00 in great numbersthere are some people that relentless farm missions and some of them do it for iskmoney conversions does anyone honestly believe that removing level 4s from highsec will have any effect on them theyll just move to lowsec and accept the losses or rent space from an alliance in 00 to rat
lp is all ready rewarded in missions however the missions dont do crap so it goes unnoticed
some more benefits with missions having an impactplexing gives you a pretty good boost in standings which is shown by ranka higher rank means a higher agent resulting in in more vps for a mission making the rank actually usefulmaybe make militia agents a little harder to get to make skills and such less of a factor
more scrambling rats in fw missions and a bit higher rewards them beeing in lowsec with a beacon to warp to hardly constitutes as carebearing  risk free isk
mining needs attention  some more ideas1 rigs except the drone rig there are no rigs that improve miningfor mining rigs there are three possible versionsa rigs that reduce the duration of the cycle for example reducing the time by 4 for t1 and by 7 for t2 lead approx to 42 and 75 more yield per minuteb rigs that improve the yield directlythe side effect of the rigs should not affect cpu and powergrid maybe one could use side effects of cargohold optimizationc rigs that increase the range of miners both strip miners and normal minersadvantage more diversitydisadvantage also useful for macro miners2 eent add a laser upgrade reducing cycle time for ore and laser upgrades increasing the range of miners both ore and ice the advantage and disadvantage are the same as above3 shipsexhumers  best mining ships  form my point of view no need to change thathowever what about a commando bargethere are commando ships that support their gang via links and provide some dpswhy is there nothing similar for mining field commando barge eg hulk with one gang link instead of the third strip minerrequired skills exhumer lvl5 maybefleet commando barge three gang links no miners but big cargoholdrequired skills transpost ships lvl5 maybethe rumored orca might fit into that rule  who knows both of course with a nice drone bay field 50m3 and fleet 25 m3 and amatching bandwidth in addition a decent tank to be also useful in lowsec and 00capital mining ships  should not be useful for mining asteroids or ice maybe some moon mining shipsof course with far less yield than a pos moon mining arrayas i said just some ideas since youre gonna be the one that has to talk to ccplet me know if you want me to elaborate the ideascheersvan
many of you seem to take macro mining into their considerationwhy is macro mining such an issuei know the roids are gone and the real miners cant find anythingbut that is just the symptom  not the causefor example i can also run at least some missions while being afkmost of the time i know that experienced mission runners do thisalso in several level 4 missionswhat is the difference between macro mining and afk missioningbesides the fact that macro miners have to use a third party programand ccp might harm them because of that there is one big differencemissions are an unlimited resource in contrast to orea possible solution provide more mining agents so miners may accessthis unlimited resource of course the missions should fit thedesire of the clients and that is mining so less courier and kill missionsbtw to protect myself from angry afk mission runners comparingthem with macro miners i decided to create an alt for this post
agreed in fact the whole miningresearchindustryexplorationinvention nexus could do with a thorough review
i support the increased love of mining as far as attention to the needs of minersbut honestly if your afking or macroing you deserved to get canflippedgankedkilledno offense but when im mining im paying attention to the screen ok so i read a book or use my second computer to check my email but still im never away from my computer or i have someone watch my rear endyeah its boring but the whole point of mining is patience and a bit of effort not to mention a bit of lucki do think the armor on miners is way to weak you could kick the darn thing and punch a hole clean through it cargo space is a bit lacking as wellbut if there was a way to increase defenses and or allow for more drones would be helpfultoo many people prey on miners and whats really sad is they dont hardly make any money at ityet they continue to do it at least in high sec i mean you make more in a level 4 mission or mining the whole lot yourself then you would in can tipping
weve been talking on vent and we decided it would be a good idea to be able to sort targets on the overiew not alphabetically but by the value of the letter as stated in scrabblethank you for your time
one of the best ideas that has hit the hall i believe that this could truly enhance the game
i support this and would like to subscribe to your newsletter
i support this ideaplease visit your user settings to reenable images
full support
i second this would make things simpler
signeddefinately support this i cant hardly find my targets without a decent organised method of sorting my overview
i give my full support this idea
doesnt make a difference to me as im still a 1 veto combo breaker
this is an excellent idea ive always have been looking for a way to do this
best idea ever
support
im mooya aery and i approve this idea
i support this idea but only if spaces count as 2
this is definately something everyone in eve will benifit from this will allow us to now search by someones point value of their name in scrabblein fact killboards could even have their points distribution done by that was well
sounds good to me
that and the implementation of toilet paper are probably the best 2 ideas ever
support this
support of course
tripple word score ftw
yarr yarr
sounds like a good idea
8 letter triple word score wincan i have your babiesedit i fail at scrabble
i think im going to have to veto this one
sure lets have a statement from the devs i mean one way or another it will turn into a massive whine so i am all for it
i say go for the price in whichever order was placed first
another superb idea keep talkin fellas
this thread is a perfect example of why just fix it already threads are stupid when pointed at complex topics you identify a problem and none of you have a damn clue about possible solutions and every attempt to put up an idea off the top of your head thats supposedly better than the status quo has been some combination of pointless counterproductive unworkable or just plain moronic yes pos warfare and 00 have problems but a thread telling ccp to drop everything else and work on it is not the solution come up with a solution or stay out of the way of those who are
look at the link i posted above about the threadnought on the pos discussion there are plenty of suggestions there so theres no point retlaking about them here this is more a support if you want pos system changed already postedit typo
this is exactly the problem i think the system needs changing but i can see a whole lot of possible changes happening that would be worse than the status quo its the old problem of be careful what you wish for you might just get it  i dont just want pos warfare changes i want it changed for the better since its a decidedly nontrivial task to define better i think it would make far more sense to debate individual proposals rather than make a petition for the one part of the debate that everybody does agree on that gets us absolutely nowhere on its own
well yeah thats true but i hate it so much that i simply must bitch about itand i really dont think they cld change it to make it much worse anywaylol famous last words
cheers to the abovei would still like to see the use of covertops cloak module pushed again
i support this idea
until they fix the war dynamic corp jumping alt workarounds ect ect no proposal will make war work at allif youre at war with me in amarr i just have my neutral freighter trade the goods i had him hual in and put them on the market as per normal no muss no fuss on my part and you cant do squat to my freighter his goods wont pay for your gankfleet even if you did recover 100 of it
ok it gets a thumbs down from me as any posts suggesting forces people to to move areas is never good but i am down with the teamwork ideabut just a slight change to you ideahow about we put level 5 missions to the place were the majority of mission runners are in high sec now i cant pretend i have read all the replys and it may have been said before so sorry for repostingas for csms i dont think any mission runnner thinks they speak for them the 1 csm that did say she was going to put the veiw of the mission runnner on the council blew her chance with her how to nerf them the first csm to answer this post was also pro nerfor balnce as we sometimes call nerfsok so the basic of my post are simple if the op truly wants team play then movoing lvl5 agents to high sec will yeild that result and fastcsm do a wonderfull job for everthing except mission stuff and next election time we can vote a few pro mission runnner types
there are also people that have a more casual  roleplaying style of gameplay  they just dont want to pvp they want to train up skills and keep on getting better ships with better fittings and they have fun doing thatsure there are also mission farmers  but thats an exeption if you force the more casual players to pvp areas  eleminate the thing they enjoy  there are a few things that can happenthey quit the gamethey go and have fun pvpingthey become minersthey become 00 rattersjust let people that dont want to pvp stay in the relative safety of highsecmost of the move missions to lowsec talk is  and be honest just people that want to kill mission runners  so no support no and i am not a mission runner  in fact i hate em 
thats a fair point but actually i think the best thing we could do for such people is break the linear frigate  cruiser  bc  bs  faction bs  officer fit faction bs path  what now pathmissions badly need reforming not just to fix the isk fountain effect but also to fix the fact that theyre incredibly unimaginative repetitive and predictable where is the level 4 mission that requires using a dictor to catch a fugitive where is the level 4 mission that requires scanning or probing skills where is the level 4 mission that requires a cloaking ship interceptors blockade runnersno theyre all huge dpsbased bountyfestsnerf mission isk boost mission rewards in lp items variey and funin the missions that are dpsbased cause we all like to blow stuff up right the legions of dumb weak rulesignoring npcs should be replaced by many fewer smarter realisticallyfitted ships that use speed transversal and ew oh yeah and dont all have the same resist hole and ammo type
the most sensible route would be some kind of rationing system whether a daily cap or some sort of sliding scale of agent availability or something of the sort that prevents the blitzers and farmers from grinding up very high amounts of isk but at the same time allows the more typical mission runner who is typically the casual player enough missions to earn isk and stay interested in the game nerfing mission rewards by half or something like that will simply drive the mission runners from the game period its not so simple to say hey why does the isk matter you like running missions right isk matters because this is eve online isk is what allows you to progress in this game to do more interesting things fly more interesting ships a mediocre isk return for mission runners which is basically a thinly veiled attempt ot ghettoize them would simply drive many of them away from the gamei am not a mission runner myself while i run a level 4 every now and then i find them boring and repetative and i find the market a much nicer way to make a lot of isk but for certain if you monkey with missions in a hamfisted way as some of the posters have been suggesting namely by either whacking the income from them by half or more or removing level 4s from high sec in toto all you will achieve is driving a good number of the casual players from the game perhaps thats desirable a lot of eve players simply despise the casual carebears we are adult enough to be honest about that arent we but if its the desire then we should be up front about that with ccp and the csm
youre bitter youve been scammed and you think that whining here will make up for your lac of common sense sorry it doesnt work like thatalso you seem to think that someone who plays 2 hours a week should get the same isk as someone who plays 20 hours a week it doesnt work like that eitherfinally tbh if nerfing missions gets rid of people like you thats just darwinism in action
this is a bad ideabig thumbs downno point in restating the arguments against itnerf l4s or move them into low sec and eve will lose players eve will lose lots of players and i will most likely be onepeople will have a harder time making isk to buy timecards people will have a harder time funding their pvp ships so less pvppeople will leave so less pvp
for those who have too much rewardcan i have 100 mill per day and not do an missions at alldo you have a slightest idea how contested 00 is even if you have full blue system people will be chaining belts day longdo you want 00 to be the only option in eve so that all hisec population moves to 00 and starts chaining beltsthis idea is inspired by rubbish thoughts one of them is omg lets nerf carebears
your entire post reads like support for nerfing high sec until your last two lines
risk vs reward and supply vs demand in missions is nonexistantid like to see it that agents have a given pool of missions they can give out each day like maybe50 of mission1100 of mission225 of mission310 of mission41 of mission5that way when you do it mission its removed from the pool for that day but stays in the pool if you refuse it this way theres competition in missioningi mean all the dev are always on their kick of anything you do in eve is pvp because youre competing with someone else for limited resources and for the most part theyre right  except for missions
timezoneshow dumb are youif you ration missions like that then the players who can play immediately after downtime clean up and everyone who comes online later gets nothingmy guess is that you either have no job or you live in a timezone where 1100 gmt is primetime for your playing habits
the pool of missions can be filled gradually through the day to avoid that
well its already how they do it for npc trade goods which are used by players to make iskso if it works for one npc controlled isk faucet why not the other too
no hes complaining about a carrier using a safespot thats significantly harder to probe out due to the way missions specifically deadspace work
thats what i call a smart pilot
i really dislike the kinetic missile damage bonus and a lot of eve players really hate the fact missile users can swap damage typesheres my solution make missiles racial the base damage of a missile should be kinetic which would in terms of fluff be the damage afflicted on a target by the missile slamming into it secondary damage would be based on the type of missilecaldari purely kinetic damage 100 kineticamarr 70 kinetic  30 emminmatar 70 kinetic  30 explosive gallente 70 kinetic  30 thermalcould base damage explosive velocity explosive radius max velocity flight time ect ect also be racially flavored well it certainly could but it might be hard to balanceso there you go all missiles would deal kinetic mostly no need for a damage bonus for only 1 type of missile secondary damage on each missile would add flavor but not be overpowered the rest of the caldari lineup could be uplifted to where they dont look so damn awful compared to ravens now no one can really complain that ravens can pick any damage type as they will now mainly be doing kinetic no matter which missile they usemissiles are now a mainly kinetic based weapon as kinetic is the racial damage type of the caldariproblem solved
ummm errr as described by their own description missiles have a warhead they do not slam into their targets for their main damage i think you have them confused with balistic type of weapons
okay then a purely kinetic missile causes its damage from gravitons shreddding the ship apart who cares you are arguing fluff
yes i am arguing fluff because your whole idea is fluff
umsuck it up missiles and turrets are different
if they want to argue over us caldari getting to choose our damage type then tell them to fit a few defender launchers and a gun or two and see who does more damage we get to pick damage but it comes at a price
abaddon pretty please with sugar on top
i fully support this idea and always have im honestly surprised ccp hasnt done this yet as it is a ridiculously easy way to make money assuming the models are good looking
yes
giving lps should be a new feature but only to members of your corporationthis prevents macros from exploiting it as they are vulnerable to wardecs if in a corporation and addresses the ops concernas for standings an option to sever your relationship with a faction set it to 0 should be possible
not really no mid slots are tackle gear and ewar low slots are damage and fitting and both are usable for cap or speed shield tankers get the short end of that particular stick to some extent ill agree but i dont see it as crippling remember a lot of armourtank ships cannot fit all their pvp gear  you want web scram mwd and injector but a whole host of ships  geddon thorax etc  only get 23 mid slotsor 1 in the case of the poor retribution meaning they are wholly incapable of fitting a proper set of pvp gear i would think this change would make their lives easier even more so than it would for most shield tankers
i doubt that while it might make say a vexor or myrm pilots life easier since their primary source of damage is drones rather than highslot turrets i think most pilots would find the stiff requirements and loss of a potential weapons slot too unendurable furthermore i cant think of many pilots would choose a highslot more cap consuming more cpu filling higher sp requiring and shorter ranged version of the current warp disruptor unless they had to  ie unless their tank depended upon it i really think that this is a solution that could solve many of the problems associated with bringing a highslot tackle into the game namely that passive shieldtanked drakes and the like would become the best pvp ships in the game by forcing shieldtanking pilots to sacrifice a lot in order to gain a tackle
hics can scramble interceptors and it is badhics can scramble everyone and it is badhics only need to scramble supercapshics must not scramble sub capital ships with infinite points
can i make a suggestiontake the current focusing script and split it in half version one only works on capitals and gives the infinate strength required to hold a msversion 2 works on anything and gives a 4  8 point scramble adjust as needed to keep the useability of the hictori do agree that the blockade runner industrials should be able to run and therfore recomend setting the version two strength to 1 point below the lowestraces maximum blockade runner strengththis would allow blockade runners to escape 1 hictor while sill being fed by two or moreps i do not fly these ships but i have been screwed by them in the past this system still alowes them to mess with any combat capable ship
at that point just type what the amount you want it to be is in other words the status quo
what they need is a my orders tab you can drag out of the overall market interfaceyou should get a market order status popup when you hover over your orderso for example youre selling scorch s in amarr at 95k which is currently the lowest market you mouse over the scorch s order and a second or two later the following box hovers over that orderselling scorch ssystem amarrcurrent orderslowest 9539999 youthis lets you know that your sell order is currently the lowest in the local system you should be able to broaden this to regional as welland when someone trumps your order you seeselling scorch ssystem amarrcurrent orderslowest 9539998yours 9539999 001 iskor with buy orders same effectbuying scorch ssystem amarrcurrent ordershighest 53400yours 01 533999 iskthen you can just rclick the relevant order and select modify which pops up the current adjustment window but with all of the current info displayed as described above
noi find the current way just fine and have no problem updating hundreds of orders quickly and correctlyif anything i think your proposed changes would make it even easier for a bot to be intergrated
your absolutely correct in what you say it would make it easier to integrate bots however the thing is the market is full of bots jita a prime example where certain characters are logged in 23 hrs a day constantly able to keep up with price adjustmentsthey play the 001 isk game all day long making it a pain modifying orders and damn right impossible to keep up with anything over 5060 orders is for me anywaythis feature would in my eyes balance out the advantage the market bots have over us honest folks making it just as easy for me to undercut as quick as the bot does

you spend 10 seconds accelerating in warp and 20 seconds decelerating no matter how far you fly aside from freighters and a handful of gargantuan systems warp speed is almost irrelevant if the change ive heard mentioned a few times of having warp speed changes also affect warp acceleration times this might be a better buff but for now its useless also im not convinced stabs need buffing anyways you should hear my pirate friends whine about those things
as a pirate i have to say that if your pirate friends cant pop a t1 hauler before they are able to warp they are doing something terribly wrong the way i see it t1 haulers fully and effectively fitted mind you should be able to escape from 12 pirates provided they arent in hictors blockade running transport ships should probably be able to escape from 34 or 1 hictor pilot to everything a counter currently there is no counter to hictors in lowsec and it makes sense that blockade runners would be exactly thati strong disagree on the uselessness of the proposed change id like to point out that warp isnt just 10 seconds acceldecel and 20 in warp regardless of distance while your acceldecel time is correct the amount of time spent in warp is wholly dependent upon your warp speed  which for every ship in the game except interceptors and ppl who fit hyperspatial rigs is 3 aus interceptors get 6 aus and if youve ever flown one or with one the difference is stark a good interceptor pilot can watch an opponent go to warp as the interceptor enters the grid align himself to that pilots destination and beat the ship there on a 100 au warp doubling your speed from 3 to 6 aus will cut the time by a third shaving 10s considering that haulers equip nanos in highsec for the sheer purpose of shaving 25s off of their alignment times i would think that such a change would be one they would consider useful that said if ccp want to change the static acceldecel thing even better
lol youre doing it wrong if you think theres a hic camping a gate dont fit wcs fit inertia stabiliser iis and if youre feeling crazy polycarbs i have run lowsec camps in an iteron with no wcs before so quit your shining and come up with ingenious solutions
exactly what i said to them but my point was that people always whine about the tactics opposed to their own  they have an expectation of being able to do as they please and when a countermeasure foils them they get annoyed im surprised to hear you say that youre a pirate though  normally buff stabs threads come from those trying to escape not those trying to kill not that i doubt you but its interesting sure theres a counter  the t1 version of the same ship a thorax ganks harder than a phobos and tanks almost as well while costing 510 as much i dont know about you but a 5050 chance of winning in a ship 20x as expensive is not my idea of a fun time your numbers are wrong 3 ausec is battleship speed cruisers get 45 frigates get 6 interceptors get 9combat or 135speed and going the other way carriers get 15 ausec and freighters get 075 ausec and my point was that in most systems the distance traveled at full speed is not relevant for a 20 au warp which is a far more common distance the difference between a battleship and an interceptor is 36 seconds vs 31 seconds or about 15 thats not a lot i agree interceptor warp speeds are nicei use an ares as a shuttle and beating them there is good fun but its not an especially relevant stat in 90 of systems and align time is wholly different than warp time people want to align faster because the time it takes you to align is how much time the opponents have to lock and scram you people dont give a damn about warp times because nobody can touch you midwarp
you mean like thisgranted ccp needs to hurry the flock up and get them posted quicker
if ccp would do it i think wed be perfectly happy to let them since they have shown that they wont were going to need another solution there should be a sticky in jpsc with links to all the chatlogs and minutes and serenity should either update wwwevecsmcom or give access to somebody who will
uh yeah like but omg not in pdf just make a forum with them stickied with links to the relevant topics broached in the meeting a brief synopsis of each issue and the debate that occured concerning it would also be marvelous but lock the status thread and send people back to the relevant topic threads to discuss the debate vote and outcome or to just whine about impeaching a csm with too tight a personal agenda
from what i could glean from that post i think half of what you want already exists and the other half shouldnt you do not need to artificially tier systems they do that on their own you do not need to make systems ownable by corporations because over half the systems in the game already are and the rest shouldnt be

the problem herein is that t2 has been nerfed to the point that the disadvantages are too many to even consider its usethis is why even some pvp pilots fit t1 ammo in t2 weapon systems because they couldnt be bothered to use t2 with the downsides or couldnt afford faction ammo
boy try to reread your original posti was proving that you were wrong as a help to you as you have stated in another thread that you are starting activity as an industrialist helping you remove some wrong idea seemed a good thing to do apparently instead you resent people that try to correct your wrong assumptions continue your way you will have a future as industrialist if you cling to the opinion depicted byt your first post

supported
i never claimed t2 ammo does not take longer to produce  clearly it does i claimed that judging by the actions of industrialists the added time taken by t2 ammo is far less relevant than the added costs of faction ammo if the producers themselves dont care enough about the time taken to raise the prices above where they are now why should i care on their behalf im not a fanatic for the efficient markets hypothesis but its a pretty good first approximation and thus ill tend to assume that the price is set at the level which appropriately incorporates all costs monetary and otherwise borne by the producer that may change if i get a whole lot of evidence to the contrary but in that case my response will be to join the market and reap the economic profits not to whine for a buffnerf i will agree that most t2 ammo needs a buff but i will not agree that the buff should be in production time since that looks to be basically irrelevant
while a boost in the ammunition efficiency would be good making them more used build time is not irrelevant as you think look the build time t2 large ammunitions 22 hours before research and skills for 5k shots vs t1 large 4 hours 10 minutes for 5k shotst2 medium 11 hours for 5k shots against t1 4 hours 10 minutes for 5k shotst2 small 4 hours 20 min for 5k shots against t1 4 hours for 5k shotswhile the choice of keeping the same production time for all the kind of t1 ammunition is a strange one the difference in production time for the large ammunition weight heavily on the returns bpo checked hybrid and projectile

 i joined the stopped at bs5 and got an alt to train for a rev brigade i always wanted a nag but if someone offers you a new bmw for 10k and a new astra for 12k you wouldnt pick the astra id love to see the nid able to make good use of its rep bonus but the cap use hurts it for the nag i like the idea of making it 4 highs 3 turrets 3 launchers extra low 5 torp and projectile rof  5 torp speedhpetc and 5 projectile damage make the thing versitile weapons wise
im pretty sure that this would actually make the naglfar even worse than it is right now and im trying hard to see what the rationale would be in the first place youre losing a high slot and downgrading the bonus for citadel torps from 75 to 5 per level and gaining what exactly
i believe he meant 5 high slots 4 turretmissile slots and the extra hp on the torps would help a bit but capital torps need to be basically reworked anywaywhat the nag really needs is a base 5 damage of torps  projectile per level and a 5 rof of torp  projectile per level the 3 turrents and launcher spots would just be good for variety

this is a pretty ill concieved argument 1000 ratters in 00 will  unless their alliance own 1000 00 systems with true sec 05  make a lot less per person than 1000 high sec mission runners who dont have to compete with each other because they have an unlimited resource in their agent also you cant count moon mining into personal income as moon mining takes an entire alliance to operate if you where to spread out said moon mining on an iskpersonhour basis which you will have to in order to count it you will get a lot less than what you get from counting it as a lump sum
yeah youre right if theres one thing this game needs its to maintain  and increase amirite  the numbers of people in it who threaten to ragequit if their unfair advantage is threatened
i support discussing this poorly thoughtout ideawhat is the problem you are trying to solve oh thats right there is no problem youre goonfleet and thus your only objective is to grief other players either through combat or through petitioning for needless changes to the game mechanicsas a missionrunner who occasionally engages in pvp i can tell you that what id like to see is mission agents becoming lower quality and running out of missions as theyre used more this would encourage people to spread out from missionrunning hubs reducing lag and providing more opportunities for meeting new peopleriskreward shouldnt apply to grindfests the rp reason for this is that missionrunning and mining are jobs where you have a stable low level income in return for grinding away at the same tasks over and over again for days on endif you think missionrunning is too high a reward for the risk involved why dont you go do some ninja salvaging or why not start calling for a nerf to trading and hauling i just made 20m isk while afk hauling minerals back and forth across empire spaceyou guys in 00 space have so many cool ways of making money  why are you worried about the millions that missionrunners are making when you are pulling in billionsop is goonfleet therefore is a dedicated griefer this suggestion is simply a means of griefing by metagaming
im not talking about ragequitters you cant do anything about ragequittersi also dispute this unfair advantage that youre talking about advantage over whoif i run l4 missions in high sec how do i have any advantage over everyone else in the game who can run l4 missions in high secdo you mean advantage over those who dont like doing missions in that case miners have a distinct advantage over me because i dont like mining

who ever said that ive agreed that theres problems and ive supported many of the proposals for fixing them the thing is ill only support proposals not the idea of going off halfcocked and doing anything to get some forum heat off of the devs this is not an issue where there is a singular clear way forward and all thats left is to assert priority its a labyrinth and a hornets nest both there is no obvious path and no matter what you do theres going to be hundreds trying to get under your skin and express their displeasure make a proposal and ill judge it but i will not support flailing blindlyedit stupid censorship
a good idea butno supportmy flimsy 2 supports make me feel sad lol 1 of them was mine
i find the current probing mechanic to be dull and dumbed down you simply drop your probe at an appropriate spot click analyze and wait for a result it has nothing to do with rl skill and it has reduced probing to something anyone can do at any time no matter their experience it is a sad approach to something that used to be innovative and intelligent sure it wasnt perfect and it could use improvement so heres an idea ive been toying withdisclaimer the idea is fairly rough around the edges and could use additional input navigation is an ancient art navigation in space is little different than navigation on the seas with the exception of adding another dimension when fixing an objects relative position you do so by triangulation it is a question of taking a bearing to said object from three different positions and then use this information to fix a position you get the exact position on the xyz axis of course you dont have to use three bearings you can determine a good position using only two you can also use more than three for a more exact fix its not complicated but it requires some thouroughness to get as good a fix as possible please see figure a for an exampleusing this in eve is a bit more complicated but by no means impossiblemethod for probingin order to probe someone down you will need at least two preferrably more fixes of the targets position you get these fixes by using your directional scanner the scanner is reworked to a 360 degree direction finder where you can read information and apply it to your solar system map the map gets an additional tool a layer if you will this is a draft of how the layer might look the layer allows you to draw lines and circles onto the screen giving you lines to work with when you have one fix you warp to another place in the system and take another fix now you have the targets position in two dimensions for an accurate fix you will need one more fix on your solar system map you now have three lines where these lines intersect you will most probably find your target you now right click on that spot on your solar system map after using the new zoom system to make your click as accurate as possible and warp to the spot if your fix is accurate enough you will have found your target otherwise you have to start again this time having a better idea of where the target iswho can do itwell everyone can however in the interest of keeping ships in their intended roles only specialized ships will provide the tools you can still do it with a regular ship but without the mapping tools its going to be very difficultwhat about in game skillsskills can be translated to accuracy when measuring bearing for instance a higher skill level can translate into a more accurate directional scanner the point is in game skills should play a part but rl skills should be whats really needednow there are problems with this idea probably a lot more than i can think of right now thats where i need input for example should the same accuracy apply to ships in deadspace as those that are not should signature radius play a part should there be some kind of warning that you are being triangulated like scanning for probes today thoughts please
interesting idea but id rather see some tweaking of the existing system rather than a complete replacement of itlike currently scan time  random scan return is a giant pain in the arseid rather the system be a little less sit and stare at a timer counting down intensive and more playerskill intensiveperhaps make probe placement more important and make the random part apply more to scan deviation perhaps even to the point of returning multiple random scan deviations some of which might be falsethis would make probe placement  multiple probe types more important that just sit here for frikkin even and hit new scan analyze over and over till it works
as many drone masters are aware there is nothing more frustrating than losing a drone to a rat how about some color coding in the overview such asred you are targeted and being shot atyellow you are being targetedgreen your drones are being targetedorange a drone flashing orange is under attack
just keep your drones window open see if theyre going down in hp if they are reel them in i like the sentiment but this is way too narrow a change and itd interfere with the ability to add more useful information to a part of the ui that is already exceedingly informationrich
as hy points out the feature youre suggesting is already more or less in the game in the form of the shieldarmorhull hp bars of your drones in the drone management windowwhen there are a lot of things on my overview the colors get screwy i see planets and stargates as red when there are more than 15 enemy shipsdrones on grid and they start dyingwhen sharing my l4s with corpmates who need help getting their standings up higher with the npc corp sometimes ill broadcast targets for aggro management to make sure the rest of a room doesnt get pulled and well see the target symbols persist after the targeted npc is destroyed the symbol merely transferring to some other rat on the overview so that when i broadcast the next target there is conflicting information on the overviewadding more crap for the overview to keep track of would do more harm than good with the way it currently works in my opinionid say it was just client lag on my end if it didnt happen to corpmates as well
i have heard from various sources that there isnt going to be a next alliance tournament there has also been a lack of word from ccp itself so it would be nice to know if they plan to continue this awesome and unique aspect to the game or whether they plan to scrap it completely because it costs too much also if it costs too much would they be willing to discuss various ways of still running it
look herefor someone who claims theyre so smart wow i mean wow
fanfest tourney  tourney weve had every year ingame look just because your bitter we kicked your arse and youre a terrible fc is no reason to bring it here ty
delete please it was a very bad idea
so what you propose is npcs putting bounties on the heads of players as a mechanism to make piracy more valuable im not sure i like that  mixing pvpshooting people and pvegetting paid to blow ships up with such abandon seems like a bad idea also requirements on not getting anything incorp are meaningless  its not difficult to have an offcorp alt also if your system is supposed to not cause inflation it will have to not be implemented  any creation of money from nowhere is inflationary relative to the status quo i dont think inflation is an issue but you cannot avoid it with this proposal
1 gain bounty2 get in a shuttle destroy with alt3 4 profit
this doesnt make sense and isnt really workable destroying noob ships bringing extra money magically into the universe etc etc
ok  so why are you proposing something tht would massively increase the profitability of suicide ganks a riskreward mechanism that is already so broken that ccp are going to nerf th heck out of its viability see whichever dev blog it is furthermore you plan to replace the current chance that the target will not drop enough to make it viable with a guaranteed income for the ganker in the form of this bountyi also dont think its a good idea to drive people into low and nil sec not that i believe for a second that this deluded proposal would have that effect if people want to play in high sec they will if they wanted to move into low and nil sec they already would have you have to entice them there not drive them there if there is a 2 year player with 40 mil sps who still spends all their time in high sec there is a reason why they are there forcing them into low will just earn ccp another terminated account and loss of revenue this looks like a troll post by an actual or wannabe suicide ganker looking for more profitable targets which are easy to kill because they are set up for npc tankage and not pvp
no this isnt that kind of post and every one of you is right at the moment of writing the original post it looked to me like a compromise solution but havent seen all the aspects of the proposed changei am not a suicide ganker just a guy who is sick of those nerf lvl4 topics and clashes between carebears and pvpers oh well back to the game 
and someone would call it an exploit since theyre taking advantage of a feature designed to protect mission runners when they arent actually running missions
deadspace being harder to probe is fine id love to see stuff like thick nebulae and electrical storms and such that people could hide in get the proper kind of environment and itd be like a giant aoe cloakthen conbine that with a remove of localok theres 50 shiops and a few caps guarding this system hit the poseswait where are all these ships coming fromwhat do you mean you think theres a nebulae or dust cloud that couldve been hiding them from the probes
hahahahano support from me no free kill for you grind for your kills that missioner is grinding for his iskexcept for capitals capitals dont belong in missions if the capital is sitting in a mission it should be just as easy to probe out as if it wasnt this should make it not want to sit in missions since it could give away the position of any of its noncapital friends
his pattern indicates twodimensional thinkingtactical environments now that would be a valid reason for all these eyesearing neon nebulae
diagree with this suggestion although no suggestion was made missioning in low sec and 00 carries enough risk for quite meager rewards the rewards are almost as great in high sec as in low sec i feel a change that would make probing easier would further nerf low sec i personally feel probing missions should take skills as opposed to todays drop probe click analyze wait until you get a hit kill before probing turned into what it is today it took rl skills to probe someone out thats what i feel we should be striving towards no support
why not make it so that the initial warp in area with the gate to the actual mission is not considered part of the mission and can be probed normally thatll keep the mission runners themselves just as safe and will not allow capital ships to exploit the missions for their own safety edit forgot to support
failure op go to molden heath and ask pirate corps like bydi and twstd how hard it is to probe out mission runners they get more kills from probing mission runners than they do on gate camps some weeks  since being in mh again ive killed 2 bydi ships both of which were hacs that warped into corpmates missions after covops alts probed them out the corp has lost a dominix a drake and a maelstrom i think to missions being probed out when nobody else was around to come assist despite being told how to see probes on dscan numerous times  its even on our wikiprobing out missions isnt broken  train your astrometrics support skills and stop cryingthis is why i dont read assembly hall more than once a month anymore too many threads like this general discussion whines disguised as legitimate concerns i poasted it on assembly hall ccp you must take it seriously nowgtfo

depends on the ship raven pays no penalty for switching missile types a caracal however pays a huge pricewould be better if missiles just mostly did kinetic damage with a secondary damage for each different missilequite aware that missiles are not the same as turrets not asking for missiles to be the same as turrets if anything it would make missiles more like dronesi would make a caldari missile ie the kinetic ones the highest base damage missile gallente would probably be the lowest damage missile since they are the race that least uses them amarr well khanid and minmatar would be in the middle obviously minmatar missiles would have the fastest missiles and the amarr ones well not sure though they could be given some kind of advantage as wellso to summarize rather than having caldari missile ships with a kinetic bonus to use kinetic or do crap dps perhaps it would be neater to pick your missile type depending on its own unique stats maybe a situation might benefit you more to use a minmatar explosive missile maybe you wanna rain down pure dps and switch to a heavy hitting caldari kinetic missilei think it would make picking your missile types more interesting sort of how sometimes a warrior ii is the best drone to use and other times laying down the hurt with an ogre ii is the best choiceoverall the purely kinetic missiles would be the overall best missiles to use but it would give some tactical use of the other missiles as well outside of exploit resist hole which generally doesnt happen in actual pvp well unless youre like shooting down falcons which obviously have 0 em or somethinganyways i am just trying to make using missiles more interesting not quite sure what im supposed to be suckin up here but thanks
managing corporate income is of vital importance to the longterm survival of any corporation eve gives this ability to missioning and pvp corporations in the form of the corporate tax the tax is automatically levied on any bounty over i believe 30000 isk and any mission reward life for the mining industry corporation ceo is far from this easy as this tax is not levied on any sale of items this causes the ceo to rely on the honor system which ultimately fails as members forget to pay the tax make math errors or just plain avoid the tax by design which forces the ceo to make big lists and spread sheets of who mined when and for howling and how much to ensure proper payment such micromanaging prevents corporations from spreading out to other regions or if key people are not online more or less shut down my question is why does the ceo not have the option to levy a sales tax why is the corp tax not automatically applied to sales of goods
because that punishes traders like theres no tomorrow 5 corp tax is low for a missioner but a trader who makes a 10 markup on everything is losing 50 of their income not 5 i wouldnt be wholly opposed to being able to charge a tax on minerals minedthough of course that runs into problems with logistics  10 of the minerals in your hold belong to the corp what does that even mean or with there being an automated tool to tell the corp how much mining each player has done but extending the tax to cover trades is silly also as an alternate method of taxing for you  instead of charging a percentage charge a head tax 1 million per player per week for example brings in guaranteed money fewer disincentives to people doing extra mining and doesnt require odd accounting schemes its not perfect but its one you may wish to consider
no i dont really like the idea for fixed tax because i cant always play much everyweek and sure 1 mill a week is no biggee but you bet that many corps will bump it up to make players more active which doenst sound v cool imo especially considering the noobs that dont make much isk and may want to join a new corp
on the flip side market transactions are currently the best and fastest way to make lots of isk in a short amount of time short of mining certain specific moons out of nearly every multibillionaire ive known nearly all of them have made that much isk by doing market transactionsi am 100 for being able to tax that kind of profit
true but only on transactions say where net profit for the total sell order wld be greater than 10mill or so say tax 5 of profit there compounding tax as the profit gets higherso say 10 tax for 50mill etcif it was like that then yes supported
if it was possible to set tax at a different level for market sales perhaps but given how many corps have 5 10 or 25 tax rates those rates would completely eliminate profitability for any nonscam market operation all youd do is drive people into using trading alts
id suggest two separate tax rates both which can be set by the corp  missionratetc tax the tax on everything already taxed  sales tax a tax on any income from sell orderthat way the corp can set a low sales tax so that it lets the people who use the market remain profitable probably 1 while taxing everyone else at the current rate

what exploits and what farmers so far as i can tell its primary use is to pool lp to buy expensive faction gear that none of the individuals in question can afford solo  a cnr say also it lets missioners unload their lp profitably without having to think about it or be bothered with the market it introduces middlemen for those who want them  people who you pay to accept inconvenience from you  and thats all besides why would farmers need this by definition they run a lot of missions presumably theres nothing in the store they cant buy which means they have no need to sell the lp directly when they can valueadd it by buying the profitable items from the lp store themselves and then selling them

i have recently aquired a charon and am looking to put it to use i am planning on supporting other corporations for a price but not sure how i should charge i am going to use freight containers to separate each order should i charge per m3 storage container or perhaps per jump could i get some opinions or other ideas thanks
use this equationamount of storage containers multiplied by amount of jumps
its the neverending storyso thought i was finally going to get my main machine working and go pew pew but it turns out the bios on my wonderful laptop is the subject of a warranty extension since it indeed breaks thingsanybody heard from fahtim account go ahead and lapsenew thoughts on things sovereigndo any good boosters lately
i did not say there wasnt a difference i said that the difference in production time between faction ammoessentially t1 times and t2 ammo does not seem to be all that big a deal when you look at the prices
first im confused the orginal poster are you upset about the manufacturing times or the useage or did you try to mask one in the othersecond no one has mentioned how freakin expensive faction ammo is comparitivlytake cruise missilse for instancet1 200300 iskt2 300500 iskf 19002200 for the cheap cal navy stuffon top of that the profit margin isnt that great for faction ammo i find when trying to sell im much better off buying implants wiht my lp as i would get more isk per lp
i cant be concerned at all about the manufacturing times but faction mission farming ammos have it all over t2 bpo or invented producers while your t1 bpo is cranking out 5k units youre running anywhere from 1 to 10 missions or more many moreso in the amount of time to crank out 5k wrath cruise for example you can convert them to cn wrath and slap them on the market for 1900 isku which is 100 pure profitthe poor t2 producer has a nice bpo that costs 210 isku requires raking in half a dozen materials  t2 comps and a full day in production time and the ammo they get out of it sells for 30 of the free faction ammo and is so nerfed that no one wants to buy it anywaythus t2 ammo is relegated to back shelf because the introduction of faction ammo completely skewed the balance t2 needs to be given a function and niche or faction needs to be nerfed back to be a value between standard t1 and t2 not superior to the only faction ammo that should have the possibility to be superior to t2 should be the same as modules complexofficer stuff or perhaps even pirate faction by just a hair not easily accessed and freetoproduce empire factionprofit margin isnt that great wtf are you smokingfaction is free to producethe loot you pick up  refine or the ores you mine very easily produce cruise missiles for less than 10 isk per unit the lp earned while the 5k run is being produced is the only cost involved at all and is a pittance compared to the 2000 pu cost you quoted aboveif you cant profit selling faction ammo youre missing a whole lot of zeros on your sell order
the t2 ammo price is low because it is not possible to sell them at a better price no market faction ammunition has a good market so they can sustain a higher price to mister xerox lp have a value so they are not free they should be counted in the faction ammunition cost
yes id bet if the numbers were looked at that t2 ammo gets very little use compared to faction ammo
t2 bpos should be removed from the game as they give unfair advantage compared to people who dont have a bposo no support
signedt2 bpos can rot in hell
lol  t2 bpo whiners  as if things werent 100000x more balanced than the old days when only 2040 bpos of each type existed try paying 350m for a vagabond tbh t2 bpos are so irrelevant these days i have no idea how you find the energy to whine about themas for the op yes t2 ammo has been either broken omgwtfawesome or broken lame since day 1 it needs a total overhaul to be different to t1 and faction ammuntion eg less damage than both but extra effects eg cap neutralising
and ccp wants to get people away from farming missions and then make lp store goods the biggest isk print in the game re faction ammo superior to pretty much every ammo type out there and cheap as chips to produce
i continue to think that a shield bufferburst tank with many damage mods fitted is the best way to do it itd still be a likely primary but with a 565 slot layout and maybe a 75 shield boost bonus and 7575 launcherprojectile rofdamage bonus itd be competitive with the other dreads and still a bit distinct besides
minmatar capitals fail need some reworking
i want my miny caps to have more fire power and better tank ayee
the nag already has a pretty good burst tank shield tanked is about double the moros  rev burst tank but its cap effeciancy kills it in a dread fight this helps but nags die pretty easily to posesid still take it over the vertical pile of  the nag is right now though

a lot of people use sisi to find and test for bugsexploits but not to report them to ccppeople discovered doing this and porting their exploits over to tq and not filing the appropriate bug reports should be permabanned
bah they mirrored tq boo i lost my bs 5 but i gained cruiser 5 so now i can toy with the t2 cruisers but i still want my damn test dread eh well gotta wait another 30 or so days to get bs 5 back
yes
oh man that would be great
against
these kind of ideas make me wonder why devs even try to play this game and still come up with these terrible ideasjust fix whats causing this by adjusting it slightly to get a viable compromisestuff like tweaking percentages to downsize the speed gain from eightfold to sixfold for interceptors to fourfold for cruisers and twofold for bsor if you have your head full of snakes your mwd will get heat dmg after 10 cycles metalevel
against too heavy handed for the intended objective i support some of the mass rebalancing to make frigates and afs faster and the web nerf but thats about all instead nerf stacking if ludicrous speed is the real problem
against nerf ccp are either a wielding a very large and overcompensated nerf bat or they are trying to introduce many less justified changes under the guise of a nano nerf
since some of us already own these and ccp is changing what they will do after we have bought them based on the stated bonuses will ccp refund the isklp to those interested in getting rid of thesewe cant sell them on contracts and they have been broken 1 year there is low confidence that they will get attention anytime soon when i bought this implant i bought it because of its stated attributes while a time bonus may be helpful to some my invention runs are time wise balanced with my base product production runs and wouldnt really benefit meid like to see an option to refund the isklp for these
somehow it seems that they forgot about it
turret  missile graphics and effects need a major overhaul battleships should have mean looking battleship sized weapons not tiny sticks classsize appropriate effects for the winmissile effects are also a big disappointment bring on proper hardpoints missile launcher turrets and appropriate effects
good idea altho it would nerf my insta undock bookmarks
interesting ideawould add a little more skill to station camping and being camped
very good ideeaeach ship size to have a special undock pointgood thinking mate
well thought out i like it
lolomg this is classicmothermoon op posted this in the linked threadhahaha make up your mind pedit ahh i see you want set multiple docking points not ranomized multiple docking points not that much difference but enoguh to warrent the extra thread i spose
supported
that is correct statement
why neone would train that pos i dunno i skipped it and went for the next one up doesnt take too long to train up
increase dronebay to 15m3 small cap increase perhaps increase its bonus slightly so it is actually better than a cruiser but not as good as a retriever
sounds good to me this ship has to have a specific role where it can be best in as opposed to a retriever the time to train for a retriever is so short its not worth bying a procurer for general mining
you mean sort of like how everyone who flies nano ships dont really have an unfair advantage because all the other people can also fly nanos or how suicide gankers dont really have an unfair advantage because everyone can suicide gank or how people who used to farm broken complexes didnt really have an unfair advantage because everyone could farm those complexesyeah great argument there
so your argument is that mission running isnt unbalanced because its balanced with missionrunningokaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
nano  ccp calls this a broken mechanicinsurance for suicide gank  ccp calls this a broken mechanicbroken complex  kind of obvious from your descriptionso what is your point
that hisec mission running is also a broken mechanic at least as in need of fixing as the above
i disagree but you are entitled to your opinion if ccp feels that hisec missions are a broken game mechanic they will and should of course fix them
and in order to get ccp to say that high sec missions are a broken game mechanic it takes a lot of whining on the forums were just doing what is traditionally done to get changes in the game
so if the player base whined hard enough for something like adding a form of concord to losec ccp should listen as wellis this what you mean
no i dont mean ccp should listen i am saying that its apparent that they do listenstart your own whining about concord in low sec this thread is about nerfing lvl 4s
not interested in whining for nerfs tbhim not really convinced that ccp actually listens when listening means changes they may disagree with regardless of player whiningif ccp thinks l4 hisec missions are broken they will change them if they dont they probably wontyou guys act as if ccp doesnt play their own game
were making sure the items stays on the agenda itll get the changes live faster and it is amusing to see all the high sec huggers get their panties in a twist about their isk prints being removedwell sometimes you have to wonder if they really do some decisions are so out of touch with the reality of the game its almost funny
you assume a bit muchwhen the actual changes are in fact contrary to your wishes can i have your stufffunny i always thought that ccps decisions created the reality of the game
only if you agree to the same thing if ccp nerfs high sec missions you give me your stuffguess that went over your head no sweat
if ccp nerfs hisec missions they must have viewed them as broken so no you cannot have my stuff as far as going over my head no but yours most likely
generally supported in principle if not in the details the problem with putting some class of mission in 00 space is that it gives sovereign alliances an unfair advantage in pve imho anyway i guess it would work if you put a sufficient number of l4s in the portion of 00 that does not allow player sovereignty i definitely support moving more high level missions to low sec though
thats kinda cowardly considering you asked for my stuff if no change happened guess you were only trying to get a zinger in there to bad it back fired this is just no u with more words try again collegeboy
thought you might ragequit if ccp didnt give in to your demands oh wellno u was not really my intention but if it makes it easier for you so be itcollegeboy one can only dream
all kidding aside i would like to ask one serious questionexactly how much iskhr should a mission runner be able to make in hisec
well yes they are going to be out of touchone of the classic problems with devs playing their own game is they loose the 60000ft perspective they know how they play pvp and where they play bob and tend to lack perspective on other areas of the gamethat being said from an economic perspective pvp is a lossy activity it needs to be offset with low risk isk generation or the game collapses the only way they can afford to cut the isk printers is to make pvp less costly or more profitable otherwise power will become even more centralized in the big alliances with their access to extremely profitable null sec resources and the smallsolo players will stop bothering to play
10 milh if very lucky normally i think 69 would be right
i usually make about 5 or 6 tops if i get good missions this sounds like a raise 
about the same as high sec mining with a hulk the problem is the miners income is determined to a great deal by the market which is player controled and thus falls in the realm of pvp because of this a nerfing of rewards of missions in high sec wont be enough in and of itself some kind of competition will have to be introduced such as the suggested sliding agent quality
regular casual miner or macro miner
macro mission runners could make what macro miners make and casual mission runners could make what casual miners make ok with you
these omfg eve will lose subs and die crap is just wrong1 people who do nothing but mission all day and play purely for the missions the minority will not be affected because they dont really spend isk on anything so a decrease in income wont matter who knows ti might encourage them to explore other aspects of the game as well 2 people who use missions to fund other things will be affected but they wont ragequit over itat least no more than a few did pirates all quit eve when wtz was introduced are all the nanousers going to quit after the nerf how about the stacking nerf many years ago did the people who relied on gankageddons quitimproving game balance and moving the game closer to its stated design goal will never kill the game you know what will kill the game trying to be a wowclone in space because lets face it eves pve sucks eve will simply not succeed if it tries to become more like wow because wow has the whole carebear pve thing down if someone seriously wants that type of game they will go to wow because wow does it bettereve offers a risky difficult pvp game and improving that would only make eve grow
you must be the worst mission runner in eve then and probably end up on 23 millhr
i support this discussionperhaps rare faction spawns along the lines of true sanshasshadow serps etc in fw complexes with tags that can be exchanged in fw lp stores for certain offers might help the missioning partsome sort of corporationmember veto on miltia members would be good to reduce greifingmake all fw wrecks looted by neutrals be punishable by navy npc spawns just a few ideas for discussion
not sure what ccp should do but they should do something to make fw more attractivewere losing fw players at an alarming rate
incorrectthe higher your rank the less standings you are granted for clearing a complex not only do you recieve less standing gain as a reward you are still trying to shift your standing closer to ten which becomes increasingly difficultonce people reach a certain rank they realize that doing missions or sitting plexes fending off hostiles earns them nothing at all they realize that fw is utterly pointless as anything other than a free neverexpiring war
its the truth
core usability such as this can hardly be considered a minor issue shakes head sadlythe eve ui has been cr4ppy for too long jesus christ all efforts should be going toward bringing it out of the 1970s and into the presentre the cited technical issues why this particular change cant happen wtf the servers cannot currently cope with large fleet battles anyway so what begucking difference is the potential additional lag caused by this feature going to make
ccp database guy has later clarified that this idea is not going to be implemented bcos if database issues there was indeed dev post approx half a year before that from what it was possible to get impression that this thing is under consideration and even implemented soonhad short argument about the issue in features forum in approx 2 months ago where reasons why its not going to be implemented are posted in longer form in nutshell as reloading ammo is database intencive activity ccp is afraid that implementing this feature would change player habits and make them switch ammo more often thus increasing database load ofc i fully support this idea but not holding my breath about getting it implementededit doh relevant quote is already in this thread on page 3 from ccp explorer
fully customisable and scriptable interface please screw macro concernsblizzard dont penalise their players by shoving a black mask over their interfaces head and stuffing a red ball in its mouth why should the eve interface be gimped so hard it is the poorest game interface i have ever had the misfortune to be forced to use id be embarrassed if i were its designerthe majority of users should never be punished so that a tiny minority can be thwarted  other means of dealing with the macro issue should be found
meh
come there is every reason to add this to the index and yet i havent seen it up there if you feel it shouldnt be up there post a comment here as to why
fixing mining missions was a part of an issueraised by ankh was escalated during our last meeting
yes and dont pepper nonmining agents with mining missions if i dont want to mine why am i getting mining missions from a manufdistrib agentand when i refuse 90 of the time the very next mission is the one i just refusedlong ago they said that refusing a mission would remove that mission from your immediate que for at least 4 hours so you are not likely to get it immediately after refusing itimo when a mission is refused it should be shuffled to the bottom of the stack nothing is worse than getting the same exact mission after refusing it
add some other rocks to those missions too couple of 00 ore rocks in each mission so that when you take it you get a few megacyte bars or something at least
i actually rather enjoyed mining missions when they first came out and still contained regular ore in addition to the mission specific stuff some of the l3 missions required first going in with a cruiser clearing out drones which dropped t2 salvage of all things then coming back in a mining ship to sweep upthe big problem i had with them was if you want all kill missions there are plenty of agents to choose from if you want all mining missions the best you can do are mining agents limited to a small number of corporations and they only seemed to give mining missions half the time so the accessability of mining missions was terrible and were for some pretty useless corps ie ones that only have a refining of 30 in their stations anyway so standing isnt helpfulso beyond putting back in the regular ore i would like to see some 100 mining agents and spread them out among more corporations at minimal the research corps should have some 100 mining agents esp since industrialists who might actually have a use for these missions grind research corps to get datacores for doing thier building and inventing
i dont do mining missions and i fly a hulk they are that bad i have a mackinaw and saw the ice mission last night wanted 20 units of ice that is still thirty minutes of ice harvesting minimum for me and all the mining missions i have run in the past were for equal or less than the courier missions i run at least on courier missions i can stack them together to run them quickly for storyline missions please remove the materials for war storyline mininghauling all that ore gives almost no faction i got it 4 times in a row i think it was terrible
i can support thiscause they truly do suck
mining missions sucks  courier missions suck worse these should both be fixed
fully support the salvage drones
nosalvaging isnt supposed to be an extra form of loot salvaging is already easy if you have a ship meant for it we dont need any mechanisms for easy salvageright now you either need to sacrifice combat capability for the increased profits or bring a specialized salvage ship as it should be
make them heavy drones and you would have to sacrifice combat capability to use them 25m3 and 25 bandwidth
supportafterall your argument you need to sacrifice a highslot for tractorsalvager doesnt hold since salvager drones would be the same i need to sacrifice that extra dps they do for salvagerpulling dronessalvager drone specsbased on berserker speed ftw25m3half speed when pulling in a wreck 
drones need some love ever since their nerf last year so give us variety like this
i love this ideaas mentioned though these drones should consume significant dronebay space and bandwidth and they should be slower than the equivalent modules that is these drones should not make the existing tractor beam and salvager modules obsolete
more drone variety is always good make them like mining drones always having to bring the stuff back to youliang
1 salvage is another form of loot thats why you get better stuff from l4 wrecks than you do l1 but you are right that its easy enough if you fit salvagetractor instead of guns2 from the point above we see that sacrifice combat capability has thus far meant guns  salvage gear but what would adding drones do except lead to the same thingwhos said yet how large a salvage drone would have to be why not make a single variant thats medium or even heavy sized then small frigates wont be using them very often which is fine and even larger cruisers will have to make room for them room that could be given to scouts insteadthat way you could fit regular guns for combat and carry 12 salvage drones for cleanup after youd be causing just as much damage as you would with 2x salvagers 2x tractors and 5x hammer ii only now youre using your own guns and ammo and letting the drones clean up for you instead of letting the drones kill and you clean up after them
except a lot of ships have more drone bay than drone bandwidth especially gallente ships they could easily be able to have enough drones to maximize damage and salvage on the go1 no its not salvaging is supposed to take effort l4 wrecks dont give more salvage than l1 wrecks battleship wrecks give better salvage than frigate wrecks though looting is supposed to be kind of a nobrainer at least in ratting and such although if speedrunning missions for lpsstanding not quite so killing the rats gives you the loot theres a reason you need special modules for it its an option for people who want to spend additional time and effort2 again many ships have larger drone bays than they do drone bandwidth3 your idea is flawed with a gun ship you sacrifice way more dps by getting tractorssalvagers than you do by sacrificing drones with drone ships theres enough drone bay to fit for max damage and have a full drone compliment out
support buttweak the guns to lay waste quickly to capitals battleships battlecruisers etc tweak the guns to do little to no damage on t1 cruisers assault frigates interceptors frigates stealth bombers etc maybe this would make for far more fun small ship pvp on the gates the asteroid belts that currently have no one in them because they die trying to get in low sec will start to fill up a bit as the reward is comparable to the risk this means more targets and you can still use your pimp gatecamp battleship to blow up people in belts this is good for everyone pirates and pvpers will be much happier to have more people coming in and having to use a bit more strategy than sit tank and overwhelm traders in their big fat industrials might have a chance might intermediate players will have an exciting place to rat or mission before getting the skills to step out onto the 00 playing field either way you can still die but you might last a minute or two which is much more satisfying than watching your ship disappear in a blaze of fire ending your 5 second journey into low sec
im a bit late in this topic but to you guys who support this i have a question to youwas the hp buff on all ships meant to let the ships last longer in fights or to let the ships pop as fast as they did before the hp buffif you answer that the hp buff was meant to let the ship live longer then why are you supporting this thing by saying increase the dps on the sentrys the ships wont last longer if they increase the dps on sentrysthats the reason for the hp buff to let ships live longerbut no not signed from me
no stupid idea
senries should be upgraded to be more inline with existing pos modulesthere should of course be guns and those guns should do a respectable amount of damage 150200 dps per gun all types but there also need to be ecm sentries cap neut sentries webbing sentries ect just no scrambling sentries let the pcsrats do that
quoted for best signatureps i dislike my ship getting blowed up when i dont want it do as much as the next guy but to me gate camps are fine the way they are now ive lost a good deal of money to pirates though most of those were by accident as i am fortunate enough to have a 2nd account from which i can scout from
shuttles cant be fit sure but why cant they be rigged theyre supposed to be cheap disposable transport but why not allow rigs to be used on shuttles to make them into better ubertransportmobiles id fly a triple t2 trimark shuttle through hed
i support this idea
and here i thought i was stoned oai veywhatever it is yer smokin can i have a hit or fifty
here have a kitten
why notif people really want to waste the isk
doking games are lame easiest solution would be to make redock timer a lot longer than minute say 5 mins
good work jadecsm dear god did i just say thatthe moros pilot a few posts above is exactly why this needs to be changed engaging huge gangs with zero risk to yourself when i was in low sec i had to blob in order to fight station huggers or else i 1v1 or 1v2 and the enemies just dock up so i had to bring 5 bs with me to kill the station hugger not to mention the remoterepping and other tactics fighting on a station is the most boring unfun and unexciting pvp i have ever been in id rather suicide on noob ships
qft
no docking for 15 min  moar blobsdo you want blobs
impressive changes that have been needed for a long time gaining an aggression timer for remote repping is not going to be pleseant but i think a solid change if you chose to stick around on a gate you gotta do your buisness or get off teh pot and leave i would have just suggested for stations if you aggress within dock range you get bumped 5k from teh station then the timers on hull types arent necessary
if this actually gets done i will play until the bitter end
at minimal an undocker should not pop on the grid before the grid has loaded for them
incrase the docking timer after the aggression and while the pilot has global cant dock until its down
supported
this excactly
fix system now
this has been talked about on several other threads but nothing seems to being done about it i had thought that fw would be the testing grounds for a new sov system i think i was mistaken i support this this ccp forget about all the eye candy and look at the issues
i have to agree that probing should take more player skill and less drop probe contackt
current scanning system isnt perfect but this idea is far worse you shouldnt be a rl math wizz to scan some internet space ships
why would it take a math wizz to draw three straight lines
good idea could use some tweakingif you can pin point them with a 360 scan that means that the directional scanner is useless if you can narrow it down using your scanner that makes using the on board ship scanner great for finding people not safe spotted too easy i think
i propose tier 3 learning skills to sell at 500 mil isk a piece or through cosmos completion would be neat to have the prerequisite of say perception tier 3 spatial awareness 5 learning 5 clarity 5 these tier 3 learning skills would have a rank of say 16 tier 3 learning skills would raise each attribute another 5 points
people hate these with a vengeance even eve devsid prefer to have more charisma based skills put in that actually does something other than you learning to learn better
these would be a mistake  more musthaves with high requisites are not good for the game and especially not for the newer players of the game
ccp has stated they regret ever adding learning skills to the game theyre not going to make more
not supported learning skills are enough of a time sink at the moment any more musthave skills especially ones that cost half a billion a shot and are crazily high in rank would not be a good thing for the gamewhat the game needs isnt a heightening of the skill tree but a broadening of the base especially in skills relating to charisma any new skills related to that should either not have a prerequisite outside the new skills or branch up from one of the existing basic charisma skills corp managementleadershipsocialtradehowever it is difficult to see what a charisma skill could affect that woulda be worth trainingb not unbalance the gameas most of the things it could affect are already in game under those 4 trees
the current way learning skills are used in the game do not add anything besides shortening timebut i was wondering why these skills arent part of the required skills for training other skillsfor training advanced skills to a certain level you would need the required levels for the base skillsthis basicly would make them quartaire requirementbut i dont think anyone would like this because training learning skills is boring and pointless
why to further the gap between the veterans and the noobs best thing would be to eliminate all learning skills give each character in game an equivalent of all learning and advanced learning skill at l5 and leave it at that there are too many things to learn in this game already i think the learning skills are out dated at this point
how about 6 7 rare implantstier 3 learning skills will unbalance the gameplay
and 7 implants wouldntthey would probalby just end up in the heads of hardcore mission runner and other safe activities anyway and will give yet another incentive for people to avoid pvp like the plague
what a ing horrible idea we need to do away with them not add more
uh no now if you changed the op to say removing learning skills hell id just take the hit in sp at this point as long as the attributes got raised to maxliang
not supported im afraid we need fewer learning skills not more
i support this solution
this solution sounds rather reasonablenow if this kind of mwd worked in deadspace nom nomand if the short range scram still disabled it nom nom nomier
its a bad idea with many many caveats eg gimping blasterboatsdrone boats and still doesnt fix the nanoingif you want a simple solution it would be that using mwdnanocarbsnake would get harsh stacking penaltiesthat is whats causing ludicrous speed and so that needs to be nerfed just like all the other stuff that got nerfed because off stacking advantages
support
simple  balancedtake notes ccp
warning big wall of tekst the abbadon is one of the few amarr ships that does not get the cap usage bonus on lasers this makes it use a large amount of cap to just deal damage alone in fact it uses so much cap on weaponry alone you need cap mods to keep your guns runningwith maxed out skills these guns use the following cap when using multifrequentie lmega pulse lasers  53 cap every seconddual heavy pulse lasers  43 cap every seconddual heavy beam lasers  51 cap every secondmega beam lasers  75 cap every secondtachyone beam lasers  79 cap every secondif you use 8 mega pulse laser iis with multifrequentie l youd have 4 minute 57 seconds of cap and without skills 3m 22youd need at least 4 cap recharger iis or 3x power relay iis to make you perma run your gunsbut that would waste all your medslots or 3 valuable lowslots wich you could use for damage mods or amor tankso your best bet would be using a cap booster a heavy cap booster with charge 400s lets you perma run your gunsnow the problem is that cap boosters take up cargospace knowing that the developers would have tought about this issue theyd give it a good cargobay to put all those charges inbut they didnt instead they gave the abbadon 525 m3 cargohold and thus the smallest cargohold of all battleshipsthis seems far from logical to mepossible solution give the abbadon a 675 m3 carghold as that would match with the cargohold of another cap booster user  the hyperion
so your complaint is having to use cap modules on an amarrian ship pardon me if im not exactly shocked by this the abaddon is a very good ship with a heavy weakness in cap and this is intentional i see no need to try to fix it  the ship is not broken
my complaint is that it needs lots of cargospace for boosters and that the cargohold sucks wich is a bad combinationi might have put a litle to much effort it trying to explain why 
the abaddons entire point is that it has good dps and tank for a short time
i understood your point i just happened to disagree with it
no this is stupid the ship is supposed to have a downside in high cap usage in return for amazing ehp and damage this suggestion is about mitigating that downside for no stated balance reason  the abaddon is great why boost it
i thinketh the cargo capacity is lower because amarrian ships do not require as much m3 for ammoplz though i if i stand corrected
every caldari pilot and almost every minmatar pilot assumed you were joking because of this statementunfortunately you are not
si
a more useful place for the extra colour codes would begreen  is reppingshield transportenergy etcsome sort of differentiation between squads could also be nice on top of the current fleet markeras for drones theres already enough monitoring by the drone window also with the amount of time it can take to get locks on drones giving them a targetting marker could make it ridiculously hard to actually pop them
we can add gangmates to a watchlist  why not drones as wellin a gang i can see a gangmate getting aggro because his name blinks even before hes taking damagefor drones i have to wait until they actually take damageand lose quite a few because heavies arent that fast
now this i can support
there are special classses in schools for your type
there seems to be a odd situation in standing gainslosses certainly on l12 missionsafter completing 16 odd missions a significant mission will result in faction gain of 03 to 125 this can be over up to 5 missions however a single insignificant l1 mission against said faction can result in a 08 faction loss these need to balanced in either boosting the significant mission gain or reducing the faction loss to be more inline with what is intendedin the whole galaxy moving one barrel of oil is not going to mean a heap of beans to anyone let alone mega corps
i failed my first level 4 mission and went from 72 standing back to 51 it hurts badly never let a mission time out
the amount you loose for failing a mission has always been severe in the extreme more than 10x the gain for succeeding in itand if you have high standings you suffer worse you can go from 999 back to 6 where if you only have 12 you fall back to perhaps 09 or somissions should detract only as much as they offer never more which is still hefty if you have high standing because the gap from 1 to 10 is huge compared to 978 to 10signed
at first i thought that this would be a horribly idea in effect it would serve to reward pirates and griefers for activities they already enjoy doing worse yet only those killing missionrunners would benefit since pirates would have no such bounty accumulated for hunters to collectbut then i reconsidered now i think this is a great idea to double to income of missionrunners per mr forumalts suggestion mission runners would just suicide noob ships to an alt a few times either after each mission or before logging for the night and would therefore scam money from pirate factions to match the amount they earned from concord bounties
ive been reading the book they made of eve  but correct me if im wrong  planets have people on them in the book  and corporation control people since the book has population on the planet it would only be fair that we had the same thing in the game this way we can invade planets take control of lands factories plantations cities and much more lets leave that for the devs since there are enough planets in eve anyway it should be something that everyone can do  although with the right skills the more skills the more land per planet you can control the more land you control the more profit with profit i dont mean like isk more in the form of resources like fuels steel components and alloys life stock etc  for this there must also be a market since players dont need stuff like this to start with lets get it to stations where npcs can buy it the further away the greater the risk the higher the value lets also include the race differential an amarr pilot would be stupid to invade an amarr planet but would prefer an minmatar planet then after invading the player can implement a government of hisher choicelets not call it colonization but invading to invade you need an invasion force meaning drop ships soldiers planetary bombardments etc  level of success depends on skills and planets a scanner for lvl of success would be nice here other matter warping trough solid mass is impossible since the mass would compress a starship into a tiny pack of metal might be an option to increase the cloak time after every jump allowing the pilot to plot a course to hisher destination  would also increase evading pvp  giving pvppilots a bit more searching to do while they kill people off p i know issues like this have come up in the past but since the book is here anyway and the game is always getting better i find it of interest that normal replies are added so the devteam can use it properly
on the books just not soon tm by any stretchthey want to introduce secondlife into eve first
so the farmers would be running wcs ges and aes all day while the casual gamers get stuck with the crappiest missions problem not solved just changed to benefit the farmers even more than it currently doesjust allow people to only run so many missions with a given agent regardless of high sec or low sec to stop the farming and you will resolve a lot of problems if someone wants to run 20 accounts so they can get 60 alts to run missions all day from an agent then isnt that to the benefit of ccp which would be us in the long run
umm what gives you that idea
the very system that makes you think its ok the npc market if your hot on your game you can catch buy up and fill all the best orders and move on while nearly worthless orders are all thats left the orders are there for all to see and has been proposed that the missions could possibly be there for all to see as well even if they are not why would a mission runner not just skip missions heshe doesnt like in hopes of getting better missions from the pool the people who cause the problem would in fact do just that because its all about farming to them and not just casually playing the gameyes randomly pulling missions will reduce the chances of a person getting a primo mission then you have the limit on the number of missions you can reject but if your farming you reject until you cant blitz the one your stuck with and keep hunting for better missions also how do you stop all the missions from simply being consumed well you add them into the game like the market that doesnt work either if all the missions are consumed during a given period then the farmers will know when the recharge happens and will be on the ball to blitz the top missions away from the casual players and still be just as big a problem as they were before so lets get this straight the only option that cant be abused under this idea would be to randomly give out an infinite number of missions right if we are randomly going to hand out an infinite supply of mission then what are you changing againthats how the system is now
as much as i dont like the concept of high security level 4 missions the isk must flow i dont think making the reward much higher outside of empire would justify the potential losses even if the bears worked in groups i doubt they could ever muster the numbers required to oust people trying to destroy their ships that or the point at which they do dominate their threats their profitability is reduced such that running missions in highsec alone would be the samebettermarginally worse
one of the problems ive seen in game for a budding industrialist is the complete lack of public research slots available within a reasonable timescale shortest wait for a slot ive seen was 16 days however simply increasing the number of public slots isnt the best solution as these slots would fill rapidly given the current demandas a possible method of easing this situation how about allowing characters with very high standing say 700 unmodified access to the npc corporations private labs for their research purposesin order to truely balance this out these labs should cost lp instead of isk to set up your jobs say 1000 lp setup  100 lp per hour base modifiable by skillsthat way theyre ridiculously expensive in comparison to public slots but you dont have the issue of having to wait for your research slot to open upso to sum uppublic npc slot one type of research only reasonably cheap however long wait to gain accessprivate npc slot pemecopyinginvention available on same slot very expensive however slot always available
posting only in support of my opedit the above slots should be restricted to one per character if you have a lot of research that you need doing then it should be more efficient to set up a research pos or hire a player research corp
there is already a mechanic that does something very much like this it is called deploying your own high sec research pos
true however this idea was meant to bridge the gap between working out of the public labs and setting up your own poslike i said above for someone whos only just starting out as an industrialist with a couple of bpos that they need to research then they currently have the option of waiting 34 weeks per blueprint by using the public labs hiring a research corp or setting up their own poswith this you use an npc private lab if all you have is one or two bpos you want small amounts of research performed on for example ammo bpos you hire a research corp when you want long term or bulk research done ie ship bposmultiple module bpos and set up your own pos only if your operation has grown to the point where you need to be doing your own research on site ie capital construction bposmultiple ship bpos as its cheaper quicker and more secure than relying on an external corporation for your research needs for that volume of research
sorry m8 still not selling me that is a really needed niche i think the current setup works fine the only thing that might be worth changing a bit is some form that allows pos research labs to be rented out via an ingame mechanic
good ideacurrently the research slots are all taken by offline alts you can have 2 on account and the jobs will be running regardless of their activitysome barrier to npc slot use must be introduced then we will see 75 of slots free upsomething like 3 standing with faction 3 with corporationsince pirate factions arent exploited that much the current price may stay
it would be nice to see that i have to admit however first theyd need to sort out the problem with starting remote jobs ie the bp needing to be in the corporation hanger of the pos owner instead of being able to run the job with input and output going to your personal hangeranything that would increase the availability of research slots would definately be a good thing my idea is just one possible way of doing this being able to rent pos lab space would be anotherits not so much providing barriers to the use of npc labs as providing options to those whove put in the work to build up their standings with specific corporations for example creodron  duvolle labs  boundless creation etc thus allowing them to leave the public lab system opening up the slots they would have been using for other people originally id thought of making it available with any corporation however it does make more sense that this should be restricted to the rd corpsit could even lead to the formation of research hubs throughout empire away from the current marketmission hubs thus encouraging people to spread out morein addition in return for the convenience of having a lab available at any time you have to pay through the nose for its use with lps thus providing an additional sink for removing resources from the gameid almost be tempted to specify that you use lps for the setup cost and rps for the hourly cost to give an alternative use for rps that isnt datacores however given that rps are with an agent in a specific field and not with a corporation this may prove to be more trouble than its worth to implement
i posted a similar idea here  basically allow players to add research and industry lines to their offices in npc stations and make them available for public sale if they want this would be expensive to set upi said 500000 lp for 10 lines but that was just a first approximation but have no other limits thereby removing the hard cap on public slot availability and making it instead be marketbased
not a bad idea have put a thumb of support against it in its own thread
maybe shorten the max run time to something like 5 days that would cut out a lot of the afk usage since it would be less useful for big things like ships but make life easier for the younger industralists who are often using low cost bpos with short times anyway
the problem with putting up a pos is1 massive isk investment at least for a young player2 has to be a corp asset so you either need to cut your toon out of corp life or start up an alt gah why are the solutions to so many problems in eve make an alt build up your alts standing yet more metagaming and start a shell corp around them to run the labpersonal poses would help with this problem maybe strutures that can be possitioned in places other then moons just like npcs can already do so we dont end up with all the moons being monopolized
no so missionrunning should be required for an industrialistwe already have a much better solution one that is based around player interaction research alliances exist to allow you to research to your hearts content with a very modest fee i would like to see it possible to open up research slots to the public but your idea isnt the way to go about it
any serious industrialist will have ground his standings up with the corporations he chooses to operate out of already as1 high standings help to offset the broker fees you pay when setting up buysell orders for your raw materialsfinished products2 high standings help to reduce the costs of setting up jobs in npc stations3 high standings if you gain your minerals via reprocessing modules thrown onto the market at below mineral cost can eliminate the amount you lose via the refinery taxall three of which will reduce your overheads and so allow you to gain more profit per itemhowever the issue here isnt my idea i proposed that as a potential way of resolving the issue which is the fact that the current system for public research is bursting at the seams due to the demand placed upon it as evidenced by the fact that the majority of public labs in empire have a waiting time of around 20 days for every me slotso to reiterate thumbs up in this thread means that you believe the current public lab system needs an overhaul to help cope with the growing playebase the details of which methods are used i leave up to ccp however providing ideas that they can brainstorm cant hurt i accept that my idea has flaws and there have been a couple of good suggestions posted higher in the thread as to alternative ideas
no  mission runners should be able to sell services to industrialists they dont open their own lines asis they use other peoplespc or npc so why not give them more ways of doing so that dont require waiting 36 weeks for slots to open as for research alliances thats a great solution if you have no friends personally im in corp with a pile of friends rl and ingame both and i dont want to be forced into leaving them just so i can get my research done in a reasonable period of time id be fine with the pos solution if the slots could be made public but since ccp has explicitly said that wont happen i want to see a marketbased solution to the shortage of public research slots and this seems like the best way
interesting should be looked into
small factions items should be scaled down a bitim not saying by any means that they should be cheap but pimping out your frigate at least in my mind shouldnt cost the same as a battleship cost per slot anywaytaking cal navy for exampletheres not much difference in the cost of standard launchers heavy launchers and cruise launcherst1 items scale t2 items scale why shouldnt faction
sounds reasonable though i dont know enough about the faction gear economydrop rates etc to know if it would actually work but ill give it support for now since im sure ccp will shoot it down if it cant work

please display the lab locations in the installations tab of the science  industry menui see a bunch of labs 3 jumps away but i have no idea where they are my corp leader informs me but he shouldnt have to if the pod interface is smart enough to know the lab is 3 jumps away it should be smart enough to say where exactly it isoriginal post
which screen is lacking in the information about system names ive never seen a job that doesnt display locations
thats fine if you already have a job but if youre looking for an installation theres a problem on the science and industry menu on the installations tab it will tell you how many jumps away each laboratory is and who the owner is but not where the lab is located if you go to the jobs tab and you have jobs listed you can rightclick any of the jobs and you will get a location context menu but there is no rightclick interface for the installations tabupdated original post

i suspect that having had multiple 00 proposals rejected already the csm isnt interested in discussing a proposal that isnt really really likely to pass the vote its kind of like banes cap ship stuff the topic is complicated and controversial and so the proposal has to consist of a lot of different pieces  so many pieces that most csm members and most players can find one or two pieces that they dislike enough to vote against the whole proposalthe csm process is basically 1 put proposal asis on agenda2 discuss it for 510 minutes in the meeting mostly poking holes3 everyone votes on the proposal asistheres not really anycompromise among the reps no dialog where they hash out their concerns ahead of timelike with bains stuff his topic was on the agenda for two weeks this last time before it hit the vote you can bet that most csm reps knew how they would vote after browsing the proposal thread a couple of days in but none of them replied to the thread saying im not going to vote for this in the meeting because of x is there any leeway on that piece of the proposalhonestly with as long as the issues sit on the agenda before the meeting to vote the csm reps could actually have the issues hashed out in the assembly hall well in advance of the meeting to vote they could go into that meeting and rocket through 20 issues in 30 minutes because the issue presentation and discussion and compromise would have been done in the assembly hall ahead of timebut thats not the way the csm works and with that level ofinflexibility i think it is a waste of time putting complicated controversial issues on the agenda majority support is just too unlikelyall that aside i think the reason that we didnt get much feedback on our thread in the assembly hall is that the proposal was too long of course the discussion we could have gotten by making it shorter would have been all chaff so its kind of loselose i kind of doubt that the proposal flatout sucked and no one had the heart to tell us on eveo everyone always has the heart to tell you that you suck
i very much agree  i think there was a high degree of burnout because the current process doesnt allow for compromise and revisions in order to make progress its more throw it against the wall and see if it sticks and that results in a lot of false starts

i mined with an arbitrator 2 mining laser iis mining laser upgrade 5 mining drones and a mining drone rig for quite a while and was content once i finally got access to mining barge i compared the stats of the procurer and the retriever for about 10 seconds and never gave the former a second thought sad sad sad me loves his retriever supported
indeed it went wrong and it is called drones and loot refining
procurer needs some buffssome i can think ofshould be able to hold 5 light drones scout or mining droneswould be nice if it had a bonus similar to the vexor for mining drones only that would solve its yield problem easily
yeah the procurer could also get a boost to mining amountbut not veldspar holy  we have enough veldspar miners in hisec as it is should get a bonus to hedgberdite and the other one found in 3 and lower
yeah the procuror needs some sort of bonusnot sure what  but something
well let me check my logno alts checklimited play time rl 9 to 5 etcetcetc  checkrun an average of one l4evening unless i get courier missions than more but lesscheckaverage time playedevening35 to 4 hours check yup i average about 5 to 6 million iskhour so maybe i am the worst mission runner in evedo you believe that one should have various alts on multiple accounts to run missions in this game if so what seperates you from a macro mineri also wanted to comment on the sliding scale agent idea must be the first time i ever heard players ask for what is essentially a geographical nerf lastly someone else pointed out the most obvious flawnerfing l4 missions would in the end result in a significant increase in the power of 00 alliances low sec will still suck
hmmm goons want to nerf the lvl 34 missions in high sec so they can farm noobs all day without moving from the gate00 pay is worse than lvl 4 well then goons you obviously fail move off the gate once in a while and stop suicide ganking noobs in high sec and explore a bit more you might find some nice cash making activitiesalternatively go run a few lvl 3 or 4 missions in low sec you get more isks for your risk oh wait that is what you want right so this thread fails the idea fails
either realise that more people than goons want this to happen or take that tinfoil drivel back to caod troll

complete bs and i stay on my original statement i play in general less hrsevening than you i got a normal t1 raven thats mostly t2 fitted i only have a single account and i can easily make 20 millhr id make more if i bothered to max my ravenskills andor get cnrfactionmodsthe only way you can justify your numbers is if you make up some silly statistic and count your complete playtime and not just the time spent on generating isk through missions then i can make an equally silly statement and claim i made something like 5 millhr ratting in 00 last month
ummyou are mistakeni use a raven with t2 equipment 1 in every 4 missions i get is a courier mission that as i said is fairly quick but pays much less than a million iskmissiona kill mission like damsel takes at least 2 hours from the time i accept the mission until the time i have completed salvaginga kill mission like wc takes me 3 to 4 hours in total to complete
you take a little nap in the middle then or
nah takes a hell of a long time to kill the frigates
only if you go with the assumption that you can make more than 15 million an hour running l4s which seems to be a key assumption in your argument perhaps you can do that i dont know i know i cant not even closepoint not madeoh yes clearly im a total moron because i disagree with you and refuse to accept your assertions at face valuelet me clarify something for you  this is the second sentence from your post above i dont see any qualifiers there you wrote it as an absolute you should not be surprised if someone responds to it the way you yourself phrased it now that someones refuting it you try and dodge it as well there are exceptions of course and then try and downplay them as uncommon etc all without any kind of evidence or qualifiernot the only exception by any means regardless its a largely irrelevant point i dont like playing squash either but that doesnt make my opinion any less valid if i speak out in support of those who do enjoy it indeed it probably makes it more significant as its not personal biasoh i assure you im not lying lucky if so its an extremely unusual sort of luck i have only my own experience to go on and that of folks that i trust and believe which does not include you in this case i see no overwhelming evidence of this unbelievable luckreally you dont consider what you wrote above an absolute statement lets check it shall we first statement includes the term accept the fact not the evidence or some other term fact your term not mine you then go on to state that its so obvious a fact that im amazed they cant accept it you then go on to disparage anyone who disagrees with you as doing so purely for profit motives a statement which clearly doesnt include largely non mission running meyou would be hard pressed to form a paragraph more absolute than the above max you have no qualifiers no outs of any kind its a fact which is obvious and leaves you amazed that others will not accept ityep nothing absolute about that at all not even a little bit kindly note the sarcasm literally dripping from the previous three sentencessorry no you have made assertions backed up by a bunch of numbers pulled out of the air and compared to no numbers at allyoull have to do far better than that
nope not everyone has the same level of skill or the expenditure in the really optimized rigged mission shipsworlds collide takes me closer to 5 hours to complete and usually i pretty much need to have a second player for the hard bit thats including loot and salvagethe first l4 i soloed was a blockade and it took 6 hours and about 2 minutes i know because i just barely missed getting the time bonus for it and that doesnt include the final looting and salvagingnot everyone can run missions as fast as some can they just arent as good
there is an extreme imbalance that seems to exist in game that has created some logistical nightmaresin 00 you have the great high end rocks of arkanor bistot and crokite theyre very valuable if youre in it for the iskif youre in it to produce though there is an extreme imbalance of the availabilityquality of the lower end ores that produce the ever needed trit isogen and mexallonfor example capital ship production can easily consume 100m tritanium to get those level of resources you would need to mine 35000000 units of concentrated veldsparthe average spawn in 00 space of veldspar rocks in a 4  6 belt system may at most yield about 2497500 units of veldspar across the three class of roidsi know there was discussion of changing the mechanics of belts in general which i dont know how i feelagree with it and there are mechanics that let you get ore from empire out to 00 or vice versa however since the rorqual cant be used in 04 you end up buying uncompressed minerals or uncompressed asteroids if you need 100m of tritanium thats about 1 billion of volume to move that level of tritanium out of empire and into 00 you would need to easily jump 10 freighter loads the logistical chain for that is a bit of a nightmare and economically unfeasiblethats where the compression of minerals into items came from by building them into something small shipping them reprocessing them yet that was nerfed near the trinity release the jump freighter was introduced as a supposed fix to this but it flat out doesnt hold enough to make it economical never mind the cost of the ship itselfi think what the challenge here is that while in 00 the rorqual when used as a compression platform can take 16000 m3 of arkonor and turn it into 800 m3 of compressed arkanor there is nothing in empire that can do this sure in 00 you can compress 16650 m3 of veld to 417 m3 of compressed veld but there isnt a veld shortage in empire and it is not economical to do so in 00 compared to the value that arkonor bistot and crokite have value to compress and move to empire trit has no value such as that and no way to reduce the mass for logistical purposesso i guess this is a request to release the orca that was mentioned so long agoi would think making something that could fit three mining links and small tractors yet hold a decent amount of ore and the ability to compress the low ends such as the minerals that dont require refinery efficiency to specialize in veld scordite pyroxes omber hemorphite jaspet kernite onlyi would envision it having a cargo hold of 20000 m3 half the rorquals base and only the special ability of being able to fit 3 mining links and industrial core along with two highs for small tractor beams i would think leaving the capital tractor  clone bay to the rorqual make it as about as maneuverable as an indy to give it half a chance to get away from pirates and a drone bay about half the size of the rorqual for some level of defense you could do two lows and 5 mid slotsso this wouldnt be a capital class ship requiring capital skills however it could require say tactial shield manipulation 4 shield operation 4 advanced starship 1 and mining barge 5 to fly the thing and then the bpos for the lows are supported by a new module but you cant compress anything that requires refinery efficiencythis way you would have empire loving folks able to put compressed ore up for sale and then nullsec loving folks the ability to move large amounts of unrefined ore to their respective manufacturing hubs
definitely supported the orca needs to be put back on the tablei see a handful of possible market side effects howeverbringing ore compression and other mining logistics to empire will make it easier for isk farmers and macro miners to mine which is bad empire ores and the minerals derived from them will go down in value as mining efficiency and capacity increase which is bad for the honest empire minerson the other hand making empire mining less lucrative will encourage more pilots to accept risk by migrating toward 00 which is overall desirable for game balance
your numbers are bad  100m trit is 1 million m3 not 1 billion thats a little over one freighter load aside from that id be interested in seeing something that could compress minerals in highsec for logistics purposes like a rorqual for that matter im not sure id be offended by the thought of rorquals being like jfs and bos and being able to use gates though id be careful with that idea
if i read correctly he was commenting on the volume of the veldspar containing 100million units of trit not the direct volume of the trit itself
supported very good ideanow wheres my 20 jking
why not do do something about the veld in 00 make it have like 5x10x the refine rate instead of the 5 and 10 bonus then it becomes practical to mine or at least less failure atm most of my trit in 00 comes from rat loot
the reason i didnt suggest a new roid is that i think it would open it up for abuse by macro miningthere are lots of truesec 01 to 03 systems out there if there arent any major battles going on its pretty easy to wander around and find spots where there are isk farming ratters that just sit there for days shooting 700m reward leaving all the wrecks i can see something like a 5x or 10x the trit roid being beaten to deathyes the orca can be abused the same way in empire however if someone wanted to put a concerted effort into stopping it you dont have to worry about making your way through a hostile power block to the uncharted regions of 00 that no sov exists to find them
yeah but what idiot carries around veldspar you dock up refine and move the trit well unless youre chribba but the op isnt
ok for completeness i am a fan of a complete revamp of asteroids in eve the sec status in a region where an asteroid first appears in will stay with normal ore say 10 for veldspar and 3 for arkonor above that by 5 and you are in a a 50 yeild zone so 50 ark is up to 2 below that by 5 and you are in a 50 increased yeild zone so down to 5 you have 150 yeild veld and down to 8 you have 150 arkonor at the end of each 5 band is another so from 5 to 0 veld is at say 2x below that you have a progression the numbers are entierly made up and subject to balancing but the point is that the empire in more developed areas have systematically mined down the best of each asteroid until only poorer asteroids exist now this would make low sec mining always more valuable than high sec mining because you can grab 15x veld instead of 1x veld if trit is the most profitable mineral to mine or switch to another there will be sweet spots people who pay attention will capitalize on around 5 and 0 sec status and a reward for holding deeper truesec for miners instead of just ratters the whole thing shouldnt be too difficult to program if the current system uses sec status to determine the ore in the belts anywaythis also makes sure that mining veld in 00 is a better source of tritanium than rats because that bothers me more than probably anything else i cant mine any significant qty of trit for my production needs in my hulk but a few hours gives me the zyd and mega for a bs
i appreciate your stance on completely revamping however i think thats a separate topicwhat im asking for is a logistics issue more than a what rock can i shoot or i want high value stuff in empirenot in empire thingwhat im pointing to is thisi need a ton literally of trit out in 00 based on how roids spawn its impossible to mine a ton without taking down 3  4 systemsin empire there is a large population of people that are happy to mine said ton as there is a higher ratio of veld rocks compared to 00333 veld rocks refined  1000 trit or 10m3 of storage spaceso i need 100000000 units of trit or 1000000 m3 of spacehowever if i could buy compressed ore in empire1 compressed veld cube  417 m3 of space in a holdrefined it equals 500000 units of trit taking up 5000 m3 of spaceto get 100000000 units of trit i would need 200 compressed veld cubes at 83400 m3 of space to transport
again your math is a problem if a compressed veld cube is 500k trit in 417 m3 then youll need 200 of them and 83400 m3 of space
you caught me before my edit went through 
if someone thinks capturing systems is pointless i can see your point there is no riskreward there another thing that is lacking in fw
one other thing that needs to be addressed in fwwhen you go in and snatch a complex away from enemies that have opened it you should recieve credit for capping it off and denying it to the enemy regardless if the system is contested or notunder the current system if you are in a system say caldari that is not contested and the gallente open a plex but you run them out you should recieve some points for denying them the opportunity to force the system into contested status

drafting a compromise proposal with multiple contributors and trying to market them to the primary beneficiaries all capsuleers go get on board the speakers corner threads and help us get a proposal that sticks
i think about something like a gatekeeperyou put it on a gate fuel it and only alliance members can jump through or blues or well what you set it forposses wont claim sovthe gatekeeper will claim sov all the way to the next gatekeepermeaning you can atack a alliance maybe from 3 sides put your own gatekeeper in place and this just brainstorming ofc just a idea how you also can thinkside effect is it will keep out isk farmers also and also that it is your space that no1 can enterand now you need to defend the borders of your mpire

although you sort of touched on it you never mentioned some of the majot problems with unused rigseg hybrid rigsany hybrid boat eg ferox eagle is insanely tight on pwg the fact that they make guns use more grid means they are never used sure these rigs do need a downside but the current drawback is just redicoulous make it eyeforaneye eg more hybrid dmg but less tracking more tracking lower falloff etc etcedit but supported on the general concept 
i actually dont agree on this  i think gun rigs are quite nicely balanced for drawbacks but suffer from problems with stacking id like to give them a bigger bonus to make them more popular to fit rather than change the pg drawback which is a very balanced mechanic plenty of boats have the grid to use gun rigs  you often see amarr bs zealots etc with locus rigs and boats like the mega and rokh can too the eagle and ferox have less grid because they received an extra turret recently but with not quite enough extra grid being tricky to hybrid rig them is presumably intended when those ships got boosted
final tweak on post 17nonspecific proposal for new hull with conditional demands coordinated gang action fleet boosting capabilities specific example providedmissing rolejumbles of snipers and aimless globs of hullseve combat is many times very disorganized with the only coordination being when globs of ships warp in and when theyre in a long train aligned towards gate xyz not only is the boring and visually unappealing but indicates a lack of effective means to apply fleet maneuvers to much affect short range and medium range bss that would be able to perform such maneuvers and benefit from them need more tools to overcome their tactical limitaionsthe river of flagship requestson another front a lot of people have been asking for a flagship hull to lead the charge admittedly a number of proposals seem to be written by people with no business as fcs who are more interested in a heavy assault bs but all of the designs suffer from the reality that an expensive ship serving an important role thats exposed to bs fire on a busy overview will be the first ship to be popped no matter if it can tank ten bss or twenty it will go down when there are hundredsheavy commandships are boringwhile the role of a flagship seems exciting at first mention designs proposed thus far are pitched as heavy command ships but command mods only offer a nonconditional buff to stats performing the role of a commander in such a ship thus resembles flipping a switch and going on with business as usual not to mention that we already have command ships and only three types of racial command mods so increasing command slots is unimaginative and without much of a unique rolea true flagship would be creating coordination from the typical disorganization of eve combat and to great effect if its a ship fit for an fc it should be doing some real leadinghow to fill itthe very definition of a fleet command battleship thus should focus on increasing the ability of its gang members to engage the enemy on favorable terms for battleships this means creating opportunities for short range bss and medium range bss to overcome their tactical weakness against cookiecutter sniper wings short range and medium range setups already have advantages but the new hull should work to fortify those advantages while also trying to eliminate some more pressing disadvantagesfor the short range bs getting bubbled being out of range or getting warped in on are the primary threats to the medium range bs the ability to exacerbate tracking advantages against pure sniper setups is the underused keyhole therefore i propose that a new ship class be fielded to fill the roles needed for medium range and short range bss to have more viability in fleet engagementsin the process of performing these duties its possible to limit the exposure to sniper bs fire and thus save such a hull from certain instapopping and a waste of another bs hull in an ineffective t2 role

two flavorsall hull classes come better in pairsstarfleet marshalldesigned for fleet settings where its ability to resist tacklers and tank the risidual dps is more of an issue less grid extra tanking slot and maybe swap the damage bonus for a bonus to ewar drones to help keep tacklers at baysquadron marshalldesigned for smaller engagements where its expected to make a meaningful dps contribution and still resist tacklers somewhat enough grid for fitting the special mods and some midsized large short range turrets or smallest large long range turrets reduce tanking slots by one compared to starfleet marshall and reduce overall hp a bitusagefit a 100mn ab and go fast with no sig increase and inherent exposure to firepower fit the smallets large turrets you can come up with and use the grid recovered from the small requirements of an ab and those turrets to allow a few heavy neuts to slide in this is primary protection from support your tracking should be ridiculous for large turrets meaning you always have the advantage when on the move the ships primary weakness is being tackled and it has tools to help cope with that tracking bonus on top of smaller turrets superior tracking and the obvious choice of neuts since it lacks grid for a full rack of anythingsolo pwnmobileits close to a solo pawn mobile in the same way that recons are but like recons lacks the capability to really gank ships and often just annoys a lonely ratter in a belt they are force multipliers it takes a second ship to make recons truly deadly fleet marshalls likewise are force coordinators they need something to coordinate to truly become effectivein closingthis is just a specific example of how i would do it ccp can come up with whatever they want but seeing jumbled up blobs of snipers or long trains aligned to the pos is disappointing any solution should provide enhanced tactical capabilities to gangs that look like they have a clue what theyre doing maybe well get some nice battles that look like the trailers
its a sound idea but for 1 thingthese big monster tanks with their t2 resists and huge buffers should not recieve any weapon rof or damage bonuses whatsoever and be heavily penalized for fitting damage modsit is a fleet core it provides bonuses above and beyond and stacking with those of lesser command ships in the same fleet perhaps even enhancing the ganglinks equipped on those ships as well as the specialized links it is runningthey drop into the middle of the enemy formation and suffer the brunt of their firepower while providing such a large margin of enhancement to their fleet that the enemy will find it necessary to primary the super tank first in hopes to bring the engaging fleet down to a more managable levelmuch like current command ships that offer massive tanks but relatively little outright gank
while its true that gallente would be at an advantage why is this different than any other drone advantage they already have sure you could fit a webber yourself or you could carry webber drones you could fit tracking disruptors or you could carry disruptor drones you could even fit miner lasers high slot example for ya or carry some miner dronesso show me where salvagers are such an detriment to gameplay1 salvaging doesnt really take effort and its not terribly elite when any business 10 step will give you the skillbook for free and yes for those who didnt know even if you started out industry or military you can go around to the others and get their free stuff too2 larger bays vs bandwidth  amarr larger bandwidth vs bay  gallente so now youre saying you envy the amarr as well as the gallente3 gunships do have to sacrifice dps if they fit something else because theyre gunships and they lose out on dps if they fit a proper tank too if you want max dps then you probably cant do much else besides fight and that includes keeping yourself alive if your target starts shooting back so maybe gunships arent your best examplesome ships would work better with the salvager drone option than others theres no argument there but thats no different than any other module out there interceptors make better use out of mwd than an exhumer ever will so whats the point my point is that everyone would benefit all around if salvager drones were available some more than others but everyone to some degree that hac gunship could fit his usual guns and carry a salvager for cleanup and that droner would still have to sacrifice space and bandwidth to carry salvagers when he could be carrying ogres instead
oh yeah sorry i forgot about marauders ill just go spend several hundred mill on the only specialised salvage ship in everight so i take it tracking disruptors sensor damps and most other ewar modules should be nerfed too cause theyre better against gun ships than drone ships also many gun ships have utility slots that could easily be used to fit a salvager without really losing any dps if salvager drones were made as medium drones all battleships could field them but smaller ships other than specialised drone ships would have difficulty fitting them that difficult enough for yousupported

id like to see the creation and implementation of mining accidents yes lets see that happen because ill tell you the fact that npc rats spawn in a belt is in no way a deterrent or even a mild irritation in fact its laughablesure i dont know how it could be done but it might improve the risk vs reward argument of those who say mining is playing eve offline

for the longest time ive wondered why there were no level 14 agents in 00 conquerable stations especially now given that one of the biggest moans is that the riskreward of level 4s in empire is not balanced consider thisalliance pays for a random quality level 1 agent  10 milmonthlevel 2 agent  20 milmonthlevel 3 agent  40 milmonthlevel 4 agent  60 milmonthlevel 5 agent  200 milmonthcould there be a better carrot to get the mission runners out of empire i dont think there could be not only that you have something that makes your outpost more desirable even if its in crap space and the cost per month i just pulled out of my ass i dont know what the cost of an agent should be
prices are a bit low indeed you have posted overall good idea it would no doubt make 00 more attractive place as currently main problem is that all the resources in most of 00 have maximum population density they can support you cant just jam 100 pilots into one station in there and expect them all to find something worthwhile to do in the vicinity
interesting concept though im not sure it makes sense fluffwise worth considering though
i like ithowever id rather tie it to standings a corp can have standings towards an npc corpi have no idea about how outposts work but what if the controlling entitycorpalliance needs to have a standing of x in order to attract agents of level y in division z to come therefor example if they have a standing of 6 they can chose agents of level 3 in divisions mining and manufacturingmore choices with higher standing of course numbers used are arbitrary
so youre paying someone to give you missions and to pay you for running themwheres the reward money coming from except from the fees youre paying him to begin with
where does the money come from for normal missions the caldari just like killing guristas and as long as you provide for their agents hookum creature comforts theyre willing to pay you to shoot them rats dont only need killing in highsec after all
basically its like headhunters who search for doctors here in the statesyou pay a guy who in turn searches for the doc who comes to your area and starts his own business based on your need youre paying the headhunter the initial fee but the services of the doctor and what he charges for them are completely separatein the case of the agent you pay the agent for the cost of bringing him there knowing that the agent will want stuff done pirates killed factions disrupted etc and will pay well to see his agenda accomplished
no missions are already a stupid mechanic no competition infinitely scalability etc we dont need to put eves focus even more onto them
damn why didnt i think of this
all the resources need to behave this wayasteroids moons ice fields complexes even agents
nothis thread is full of people many of whom i think will have had little or no lowsec experience aside from maybe being ganked in an ap hauler or some suchramp up the damage from the guns and it will only result in bigger camps which are harder to break resulting in less fights and more gankage of unsuspecting passers bythe guns prevent the use of small fast tacklers and nanoships on the gates that is good enough for me stick to the highsec pipes if you dont want heavy campsif you change this it will make things slightly harder for weaker pirate corps but the big ones will still flourish and profit off the traffic the weaker camps are no longer picking upop fails
sentries should be removedthey do not help those caught in a gate camp sentries makes no difference to themthe only time sentries makes a difference is when pirates meets anti pirates then they work as a excuse not to fightkeep sentries at high seclow sec boarder gates and stations remove the rest
i was all ready to expose this original idea only to find out that different people have suggested it over the years so ill give credit where it is due bottom of post and just stick to the facts capitals currently have an up front build cost after which they exist forever until destroyed there is a minimal peruse cost relative to the value of the ship the proposal is to incur a maintenance cost to reflect the fact that these ships require significant economic resources to have in inventory and deploy the nature of the maintenance cost is not specified in this proposal but some people have suggested different levels of states that can offset some costs such as mothballing resources and time are required to reactivate hopefully this will encourage more use of conventional fleets in lowsec and 00 warfare possible problem with the proposal is the higher cost of destroying enemy poses since more resources need to be available to maintain a capital fleetedit linkies updated referenceslinklinklinklinklinklinklinklink
i would love to see alliances spending a healthy portion of their rediculous amounts of isk trying to maintain the dozen or so titans they keep bringing to a fight
ozone stront and racial isotopes dont count as maintenance
stront  ozone  heavy water  isotopes all consumed in huge quantity every time a capital moves or fights and ofc you have the capital ammo  xl ammo  fighters both that are expensive as hell 
thanks for the replies as i mentioned the peruse cost is minimal compared to the acquisition cost it is not huge and actually trivial for any wellorganized alliance ice mining etc depending on your alliance fighter losses are replacedwhat you describe is the statu quo i know theres always resistance to change but honestly the current buildup of capitals cant go on indefinitely for this game to survive if you dont use it it can stay in hangar indefinitely this doesnt only apply to titans if you want capitals to be badass muthers and act as a credible offensive deterrent then you should have to maintain themright now they are a permanent defensive fixture with unlimited gas mileage
so what youre saying is because alliances work to maintain their capital stocks  you think ice mining is free or alliancebought fighters  then its too easy thats just nonsensical as for requiring maintenance to keep them in hangar id agree that its unrealistic but this is a game gameplay comes before fluff
actually i could see this for supercapitals since they never dock in stations thus dont have any of the station services to assist in upkeep not sure what sort of fee would be incurredisk trade goods ice fuelbut it could be a nice curb for the titan population explosionactually i lie it wont do a damned thing to the titanmothership population because the alliances that field titans wont have any issues paying to play as it were you might impact the smaller players who use supercaps but probably not and they wouldnt be the real targets for this anywayits a good idea might help a bit but ultimately it wont do more than be an annoyance at best for capital pilots
so you are making a proposal of change based on the assumption that alliances pay for the maintenance costs of capital ships so by hitting a minority that may be getting some of these costs covered you are willing to penalize the majority of the cap pilots that has to pay their maintenance costs alreadyburdening game play is not the way to go if you want to genuinely control the caps online issue there has to be a better way than making this akin to pos logistics which bites  in the first place
im not saying any of those things ive always been thankful to alliance industrials for providing fuel ammo and fighters and i know that producing them is as much a pita as maintaining poses all im saying is that the current capital situation cannot continue foreverperhaps the impact will be limited on the richer alliances but then again having a constant drain on your resources will impose a limit on just how many caps you can support and it opens opportunities for conventional warfare it certainly is better than the current outlook which will have alliances able to field dozens of titans eventually its just a matter of timeim saying no such thing im saying no one is paying maintenance on capitals or any ships whatsoever at this time and that they should for operational expenses which are not maintenance most alliances i or my alts have been in provided stront fuel ammo fighters etc for ops doesnt yours which minority are you referring toi entirely agree being a pita in a game is not good design id really like to hear about other suggestions to limit cap use or at least make it more funi see that people are getting hung up on poslike mechanics as maintenance which i really didnt have in mind when alliance industrials were talking about pos refueling it made my eyes bleed so i can imagine what actually refueling them must feel like arghi wanted to stay away from describing something because it can be nitpicked and the bigger issue lost but here goes how about nonrepairable damage being applied to shieldsarmorstructure or ship bonus reduction over time and you have to pay isk to get it back to 100 efficiency maybe lower cap costs and increased maintenance so that people will be less shy to use them and lose them in mixed capconventional fleets

it happened again this time i lost 120mil this sucks i caught the 3 key right next to enter also on this occassion i received no warning box despite the item being trading between 1323 mil it accepted my by of 135mil without question in reply to nande yanen who says im lazy for not checking why dont you read my post properly as i said previously i caught an extra key as pressing the enter key this has nothing to do with being lazy the price i had typed in was fine before that also in reply to nande who says this is nothing more than a fix for inattentiveness this cannot be right if the item is being sold on the market at a much lower price then that is what it should take out of your wallet can you imagine going into the supermaket and buying a small item with a big note and instead of them giving you change they just say thank you very much and shut the tillfurthermore i am not asking for a change in who gets the winning bid just the amount of money paid when there is a difference between buy order and sell order therefore you whole argument is pretty irrelevant to this threadnot happy
replace your keyboard jkbut still either way this can swing both directionsone party will say your not being careful about typing the other will say we should have more confirmations but they will call that annoyingbest of luck to yah either way
no need for more confirmations just make it buy fromsell to the preexisting orders rather than filling at the price you specify simple common sense and acceptable for everyone except the random lucky slob who gets 10x more than he asked for occasionally
no just be careful what you type in we traders dont need to be babiedthis is a broker system if you offer to by item x at 1mil isk but the going price is generally 200isk of course the selling broker is going to take you up on the offer
i support the role bonus for the lachesis and arazu also the low slot idea i look at the damp strength rigs as well they are only at 5 currently one more thing damps use a significant amount of cap for the payoff
damps work fine at fleet ranges boosting their strength would overpower them there
if you use evemon you should look at some of the nonpublic ie unavailable skills that could be available to you and i would like to see one of them introducedreintroduced into the gamewarp navigation  skill at navigating in warp 10 bonus to warp accuracy and 10 less max range from desired warp location per levelso if you train this skill appropriately you could reduce the amount of space between you and an object that youre warping to it could be a bookmark a jetcan a fleeted corpmate whatever i dont care what youre using it for but shouldnt this skill be trainable wouldnt a pilot be able to train up so that heshe could better control hisher shipyou might have others that youre interested in since there are more than a few of them however this is the one id like to see implemented
im supporting my post you should too
i think that would be a good idea myselfwarpping could use some minor improvements depending on the skills usedsuch as lower alignment times quicker accelerations to warp etcetcskills for training such things could take longer of course but the advantages would be rather nicesigned
the thing is im pretty sure warp deviation right now is as close to zero as the game engine will allow the warp navigation skill was created in an era when warp to zero didnt exist and the minimum distance for warping to something was 15 km this created a trade in insta bookmarks set 15 km past a gate that would allow you to wtz on the gate and warp navigation was i believe one of their intended fixes to the problem of instas destroying their servers ultimately they just broke down and added wtz thus making warp navigation useless and relegating it to the status of database trash i would like the skill if say it made your warping fasteracceldecel top speed or both but in its current form it would be utterly worthless and probably not even possible to implementwe already have four separate skills that lower alignment times and quicken acceleration  two generic two for specific ships see spaceship command evasive maneuvering advanced spaceship command and capital ships
no it already takes around a month to get reasonable learning skills around 3 to max them you want to add more to thatworse it will increase the gap between new and old players as new players will either have better things to train or will quit from boredom while those of us who have been here awhile will wind up training them to whichever level yields returns within the next year or soits painful enough building an alt and getting the learning skills up i cant imagine going through three tiers of learning skills as someone with only one account
this is where im coming from why would it be necessary to get tier 3 learning skills it would just be neat to have something out there say even more rare than 500 mil isk a pop i dont really care about seperating veterans from new players imo skill options should quadruple theres not enough out there there are people out there with 80 mil sps not flying caps and there are people out there flying caps with 30 mil sps i want more diversity i am not interested in fairness or even balance or even convenience this is eveliving in the ghetto or in third world countries is pain tier 3 learning skills is just some more icing to the cake
i understand your motivation but what you fail to realize is that people will see these as being necessary for taking a rank 3 to 512 days for me and then a few more days to get the tier 3 to 4 i get 55 to an attribute thats over a 20 increase and thats really not optional youd be giving me a job  raising 2 billion of disposable cash  and calling it a present and lets not even think of the reaction newbies will have to seeing a gigantic brick wall between them and the ability to even match the rate of skill increase the vets have let alone feel themselves to be catching up im not opposed to learning skills but the amount of investment needed for the current ones  24 weeks and 18 million  is reasonable and well within reach for everybody yours requiring closer to 3 months and 2 billion are not
lvl5 clarity returns of investement  3 years whats your point p
really where
he is correct i heard it at fanfest and there is a dev post somewhere where they say and i am paraphrasing that said something along the lines of eve has become rather complex since inception with additional things to learn and be better at and maybe the learning skills were not such a good idea in hindsight

and i suppose im the big evil carebear on the council or so they say i brought up mission improvements yesterday and lavista vista is working on a complex plan to improve industryif you have any ideas you would like to see addressed please speak upactually i do first on my list is the courier contract system needs a revamp when contracts have a fee of 12000 and a bond of 15 million that is just terrible game designmissons are dreadfully boring grind this system needs a huge overhaul also get away from the pew pewmining for nonpvper hasnt changed since release still the same rock patches and the same ore and the same 13 rats in high secand as for combat there is no middle ground its all or nothing why i know as a miner my skills will never be on par with pure pvpers so theres no way im going to waste my time being another target for themthats why there are two eves high sec and low sec and high sec is the red headed step child to the developers they hate ustheres not any big nonpvp corps because when they get too large they become a target and get wardeced every week and either they are forced to change to pvp or members leave the corp or the gamego read the star trek online forums many of the concerns there are from exeve people most od which are nonpvpers forced out of eve in fustrationi cant believe there wasting time on walking around whith all these systems broken for years
this has got to be a troll
could you kindly link this eve insider as in the minutes for each meeting whenever i try to find it i just come back to the same old forums i cant find details for meetings unless theyre being addressed on a subforumwe are we have been but we have seen very little concrete direction that our concerns have been anything but escalated very little has been addressed constructively and a lot of the ahm csms personal agendas have taken a considerable forefront to the concerns to the rest of the playerbase
you can tell by the posts that many of the responders are pvpersthere would be many more people playing eve if some of these areas were fixed and pvp was more player friendlyfor me eve is a lovehate thingi love that eve is in some ways more serious and mature than other mmos and that there are some things in eve you can do semi afk instead of being forced to micro manage all the time you can still do housework or wrangle kids or do homework ect and still acomplish things in gamebut pvp has a crippling effect on nonpvp players and activities you cant very well go out with a 40 million isk miner where some wardec can come along and blow it up same for hauling goods around the galaxy so what few nonpvpers are still toughing it out sit chating in hangers waiting for the war to end and hope that it wont be renewedid love to haul player goods around the galaxy but the courier system is very crude and no faith in the system exists like with other real postal systems you cant have a raw real postal system in a game there is no supporting systems like a justice system that punishes thiefs and pirates so you have to do the next best thing make a workable system to do that is prety easy take the transported goods out of the equaision transport tokens that represent goodsthis means that shippers are 100 sure of not loosing their goods and for you pvpers you could say that this system isnt available in low sec spaceas ive posted elsewhere there are two types of shipping boxed and bulkboxed a shipper buys a box 15101001000 and pays a fee based on size distance risk and special handlingbulk the shipper buys a shipping contract based on a m3 price like a 1m3 box this allows any number of shippers to participate in the delivery only limited by their cargo sizeif a hauler is unable to deliver the goods in a preset time there blone up or left the game ect the crates reappear back at the origin point for another hauling attempt untill the goods finally make it to the destonation
eve pvp is eve
i dont quite adhere to the eve is pvp philosophy but its a very real part of what makes the game more mature as you say what would eve look like if losing your ship meant you respawned in hangar with some damage to your modules t2 gear would be almost worthless and factiondeadspaceofficer gear would be nearly mandatory for everybody what would that do to industrial production  a fairly carebear endeavour but one that requires a shockingly bloodthirsty pvp model to attain depth in as for your 40 million isk miner i have to say youre not very good as a miner if youre not into a hulk yet  a proper mining ship costs circa 200 mil these days for the hull 2 cargo rigs and fit but aside from that even a highsec covetorwhich is what i assume youre flying can make back its cost in about four hours of mining if you have a hauler on hand or maybe six if you dont if youre any good at this game you should keep a cash cushion on hand to allow you to deal with losses also wardecs have a 24hour warning clock  you cannot possibly be blindsided by one and lose your ship as for courier work you really need to learn how to use collateral properly if your goods are worth 100 mil set the collateral at 150 mil and if you lose it buy another and take the difference as a fee for the inconvenience thats the beautiful thing about a robust market  replaceability
i think you brought up nerfs not improvments
also you havent taken into account that you dont need to hold ammo hypes megas hell even ravens all need significant space for ammo amarr ships dont need such things since ammo is small compartivly for teh ammoutn of shots you get for t2 and faction t1 is infinite
you are a also faction and t2 laser ammo does need spare in your cargo as it does run out i support this idea as the abaddon eats through cap boosters like no other ship
lol in other amarr bs people use the rig slots for resist bonuss or trimarks maybe even damage mods in the abaddon i suggest semi cells cccs which are a fav on the other two as well or the discharge one which really does wonders for cutting down the cap usage on guns
your abaddon needs 8 m3 for a full reload my hyperion needs 80m3 for a reload assuming each of us keeps two kinds of ammo on handi dont know about you but i do the abaddon has 4m3 more for cap boosters than the hyperion does you cannot complain about that also the abaddon eats cap boosters just like every other battleship  you stick on a heavy injector and eat them as fast as you can when you want to have everything running and maybe ease off a little when you get in close and turn off the mwd it wants them more than most but it doesnt use them any faster
well there are moduals called cargo expanders and cargo optimisation rigs which all exist already if your cargo hold isnt big enougth for you ship fitting is optional and abbadon is already one of the best battle ships in game so stop whinging
you have to be ting me
no one said you had to fit your ship in an intelligent mannerspecialized fits have little to no purpose but i suppose you could blow 90 million on cargo expander rigs so you could hold more cap charges in the meantime i will enjoy looting your cap charges and start making more cargo expander rigsthe op is still asking for one of the best bss in the game to be made even better and eliminate its only weakness which is pretty bold to say the least
im not in favour of a simple clean up mechanic make it more involving although a pos takedown is an arduous process its ironic how people are complaining about lazy pos owners not keeping them fueled so they want the game changing as theyre too lazy to destroy it through a wardecmake the pos drop loot ie composite minerals or seed a new skill which allows you to deploy marines who will capture the pos over x amount of timeas chribba said there is a potential to create a new mini profession which solves what appears to be aproblem for some people
interesting idea but in the spirit of risk v reward theres something lacking what do you think about something like this when a tower goes oflline you can instandly start your unanchoring but such an action takes 50unanchoring skill  5 minutes to complete and also sends the victim a corporate mail than someone is trying to break into their posif your succesfull you get away with a shiny new pos if theyre not sleeping youll get an angry pos owner dropping by
yes of course the unanchoring attempt should take time after all it takes a long time to unanchor normally so it wouldnt be more than right to have one attempt take at least the same amount of time as the normal unanchoringas for risk vs rewards you could easily be flagged towards the pos owners and with the unanchoring module needing to be active for the duration of the attempt  theres your risk or something along that line
i like the chribbas idea better than the ophave a module possible requiring a skill based on hacking v that can unanchor offlined foreign towers and structures having a safe period for the offlined tower say 30 days is a possibility but i do not think is neededthe hostile unachoring should take the same amount of time as a normal unachoring procedure and the module has to be active throughout the whole period if the unachoring attempt is disrupted it will fail and a new attempt can be made the corp that owns the tower will be informed automatically by mail that their tower is under threat and the perpetrator will be criminally flagged towards the corpedit same module or maybe the normal hacking module should be able to hack structures to give access to storage time required could be 15 minutes or so and again the owning corp will get informed by mail of hostility towards their assets
the goal of all of my suggestions has 1 theme reduce the concept of shooting stationary structures for endless amounts of time furthermore any change which requires people to police and maintain their space more effectively either through better stewardship or by superior pvp skill are the best changes an offlined tower is nothing but a boat anchor after anything important has been popped a mechanic for the scooping of the tower or any hostile anchor module should be put in place personally 30 days is way too long what i would like to see as a compromise would be 1 for any offlined tower any attempt to unanchor a tower from someone who does not have the roles to do so causes a notification mail to be sent to the owner only during a 3 day period from the time the tower went offline after 3 days no notification of unanchoring will be sent2 tower unanchoring skill tie it to hacking if you like or whatever and have a second module unanchoring less sp requirements to unanchor modules pos modsbubbles i am not to sure on exact details but a chanceskill based method would be a nice compromisethe 3 day stipulation is there because quite frankly the stewards of the pos have already received enough mails about resources being low that they should know whats going on it was a decision by ccp to not allow people the ability to unanchor others stuff if you tie the concept of pos installations to sov any change which promotes more active participation in holding sov instead of just putting up huge hp buffers which require extreme boredom are good changes and certainly not whining sov should be about combat capability logistics and maintence and politics right now hp rules all and boredom is its  nobody likes repping for hours and nobody likes shooting for hours as well these small changes help all corps and alliances
personally id be more amicable to a lose shield at the recharge rate the start of the offline mode so that if you found said failed pos itd be easier to kill as the longer its been offlined as the shield has been failing over timeif its also offlined the armorstructure starts taking damage as the shield cant stop blah blah blah insert rp stuff here from damaging it so eventually they just explode on their own say 30d of offline
basically the concept is that the asset is remains an asset and not a black hole of hp after a tower is left to go offline this would put more emphasis on careful maintanence of pos installationssov and not just oh well if someone wants to waste the ammo they can then ahve the moon there is really nothing stopping teh simple change i never understood restricitions on unanchoring other peoples stuff there needs to be limits of course but the status quo shouldnt be acceptable
im all for the pos being removed after such and such time has passedweve just unanchored ours and it is quite involving but honestly if people dont clean up after themselves they should either be salvageable lootable and easily destroyed like any other destroyable object in evesomething somehow must be donesigned emphatically

very bad idealooks like gankers want an even easier kill  dont want to work at it at all and propose no new mechanism to balance out the removal of local
you got to be one of the biggest n00bs in the world you ever heard of a info chan  you presence in 00 is monitored by the time you enter controled 00  or you thought yourself the holy spirit  unseen  unheard of and totaly innocent learn to hunt and then you will get plenty of kills 
after having tried to play through this mission last night i went to looking up mission guides for itfirst i checked evesurvivalorg as the usual suspect no real info on running it just damage figureswhich were huge okso i googled it and looked aroundthe best advice i can find from anywhere on how to solo this mission is dontas pve in eve is mainly a solo activity in fact it didnt even have options for group play until fairly recently i think a level 4 thats nearly impossible to solo is a bit out of lineid like ccp to take a look at this mission and possibly tone it down a bit to make it more inline with other level 4 missions especially considering the lack of bounties and the mediocre reward for this missionthis could be done by either slowing down the spawn rate a wave every 4min currently setting it to the normal trigger system making the gate easier to blow up so blitzing is possible or any number of other ways im sureplease take a look at this mission thanks
i support myselfwith both hands
please dont try cramming more info on to the overview  its got enough going on as is  and not to mention on occasion its just plain wrong
ive spoken to a few people and read many posts on it in other forums would it be possible for the csm to bring up the issue of the font to ccp it is really difficult to read and some characters require the use of say windows magnifier to be able to distinguish them from similar characters so selectable fonts please  or something similar  my eyes hurt 
i suspect that eve draws its font from a font file find it and modify it
blinky on to something using eve voice also has the advantage of using your account instead of registeringthe difficulty of such an external client would be what to do with your fleet setup and ctdeg having 3 ctd in an hour  or problems regarding alt scouts double boxing etc which are a disadvantage over tsvent already atm
bounties are absolutly useless everybody i know collects their own bounties with an alt meaning if you put a bounty on someone you are basically giving the guy who killed you iski have no real solution to the problem other than dropping the bounty system completly or maybe have a bounty hunter milita can only attack people with a 2 or 5 standing can only attack people with a bounty do not get a sec when attacking those people do not get attacked by station or gate guns when agressing negsec  bounty people
the bounty system does need fixing because as it stands now either someone has a bounty too small to be worth going after has a large bounty to show off probably one him stuck on himself or will collect the bounty on himselfeven removing the bounty office would be better than the current systemthough a while back i did think of another way to have a working bounty system  assign a value to almost every item in game especially the expensive stuff all ship rigs and implants should have values assigned the value could be static or calculated dynamically all that matters is that this value is below the cost to replace it  insured ships would be worth less than an uninsured ship of the same type simply because the target loses less if the insured ship blows up  pods are valued at about 75 of the cost to replace the medical clone  when someones ship is destroyed the people on the killmail get the higher of the bounty or the cost of all destroyed items split between them the bounty on their head is then reduced by this amount  when someone gets podded the people on the pod mail get the higher of the bounty value or the value assigned to the pod  implants split between them the bounty is then decreased by this amount  selecting someone would display the total amount of bounty remaining not the value you would get for the next killthis would mean that people would stop podding themselves for the bounty because they would lose isk every time and it would mean that if you stick a very high bounty on someone they wont just get killed once they will keep getting killed until they have lost quite a bit
in which youve got front row seats right next to each otherlet the guy get his point across without the smack
signedthis really sucked when i was first starting and trying to build up standings but failed a mission or two
not currently it doesnt loot belongs to the person who killed the ship but the wreck belongs to me however in lieu of me actually being there to pick it up ill let whoever is fastest pick it upso just be fast enough to salvage it before i do and you wont have to cry so much about it
i have a counteroffer for you you can go to a place where everybody is vulnerable to your guns and they dont even have to go near your stuff heck you dont even need to have stuff out in the openits called lowsec look into ituntil then ill be happily salvaging and looting your missions and waving to you while i do it
hahahaha you notice that too well suppose we can give it time and come up with another angle seems more like a marketing war than coming up with a good product
quick thoughtin the future i think we should shy away from discussing the reasoningphilosophy of changes and just dive into a very flexible document with specific examples thats probably the model for an op that will survive everyones hopes and disagreements for the changes well enough to spark discussioneven if it does generate more riffraff it will get the topic bouncing along well enough to collect supports and csms will be debating the op more than the crap that followsffs theres a thread right now getting endlessly bumped about all the reasons pos warfare sucks its unthinkable that we cant at least get the major points throughseems like the greatest resonance is in the switch to planetary sov battles and the satellite system for driving more interesting conflicts the battles will be harder probably for attackers and defenders but there will be fewer of them and the fights will happen even when one side thinks they lack manpower to go for a clean sweep compared to boring pos shooting that seems like a win for everyone
no offence guys but theres a thread one month older than this one about it linkage might want to take a peek in there too 
most everyone active in this thread has put a post in that thread and surely everyone is aware of it since its linked in multiple other threads getting juggled around theres also a massive sov thread pos and starbases the future thread going on in the ideas and features forumthose threads are massive and every other post is yet another radical idea its so daunting to weed through them that i usually only make it a page at a time and forget half of what i readi kind of enjoy the peace of this thread it seems to continue taking direction and enjoying the relative inactivity of the speakers corner almost as though serious proposals would naturally be better off if they started here

yeah change it before i train for amarr caps
im a minmatar pilot and my roleplaying genes keep telling me to stick to minmatar ships only for now thats fine cuz minmatar have some badass pvp noncap ships and i still have to train up some of the t2 variantshowever i am quite hesitant to start skilling up for capital ships because the minmatar capitals just sucksure people say they can be usefull if used properly and for the right goals but generally making 3 racial capitals that work with either dps or tank and then a 4th that works with insert random purpose here just doesnt sound right to menow personally i wouldnt mind that at all actually i like diversitybut the way it is right now all the random purpose experimental ships are matari leading me to believe ccp uses the minmatar as their sort of bastardly experimental race to just play around withi am not going to propose any changes or anything because honestly if ccp needs their players to tell them what to change on the ships theyre not doing their jobs right and dont have a clue of the game at alli will however say that ccp seriously needs to stop the funky ship layouts for minmatari dont mind projectile weapons i especially dont mind them not using capacitor hell i even dont mind having to train both armorshield tank and even projectilesmissile skills but training all that just to find out all matari ships from battleship and up suck yes the tempest and maelstrom need some freaking fixing too just doesnt make any sense at allso its either make the minmatar capitals more uniform with the other races or even out the random experimental purpose capitalships between the racesie minmatar get a random purpose carrier caldari gets a random purpose dread etci am honestly getting sick and tired of how little love ccp has for us matarii was relieved when nanophoons were invented and thought finally we found something were good atjust to find ccp nerfing the  edit whoops curse outta speedmods not soon thereafterand now i hear ccp is going to nerf speed even morewhy dont you twist the knife in my back around a tad more will yaminmatar are already the overall worst race to fly and you go and nerf speedships even moreread minmatarships since minmatar ships are basically the only ones that overall rely on speed cuz they sure as hell tank for nothingok sorry for the long incoherent post just venting my frustration and angerapologies to any people i might have offended playerbasewise or ccpdev wisewe just need a boost a big one thats all

i hope we will be able to take benefits from the transport skill
give it 150000m3 capacity 6 high slots with 4 tractor beam hardpointsmaybe some sort of salvage range bonus or something like that too something useful or perhaps give them a bonus to agility and i mean 10 so that they warp 2x faster than the large freighters150m3 and 1 million m3 hence the better agility
i would like the ship to have a ship maintenance bay large enough for cruiser and battlecruiserthis would ferrying rigged t2 ships much easier in empire and give the new hauler a unique role
maybe you should try and read what you quote before you go off on a rant ive highlighted the important part for you
i find it hard to believe that its even possible to be that slow i remember doing wc in my very first t1 fitted raven with really  skillpoints where i had to warp out a couple of times and i never got close to those times you state here missionrunning does not take any skill its mostly just optimising your dps after you have got your tank to a reasonable level at most you need to be aware of triggerships
no
drones i am a terrible caldari i have like 3m drone sp and 600k in missiles just launch drones and send them on the little ships while you torp or cruise the big ones normally the drones finish the little guys before i finish the bsalso this is getting a little bit apples and oranges if your took these same mission runners to 00 to rat they wouldnt be at the top end of the pay scale either so saying a suboptimal mission runner makes less than a hard core 00 ratter is a bit dumb my biggest problem is that normally 00 ratters have competition that prevents even close to peak numbers and missioners just turn down a courier mission and next is full of targets again use a kill agent courier and mining missions are not good on isk
the raven is considered by most ive spoken to anyway to be the primo mission running ship in the game  so its not surprising that your experience was betteri was running it in a mostly t1 fitted dominix much lower dps virtually impossible to hit frigs with the guns unless they are very far away etcgranted there are probably better fits for the ship  but thats what i had and it did work due to the length of time i actually took my salvage ship into the mission space several times to clean up sections of rats i killed before coming back into the combat i got quite a lot of flak in real life as i had guests show up and i didnt want to leave the game have it respawn overnight and have to do it all over again the next day  meaning i was late for the stuff id planned with my guestsi never figured itd take that long either
maybe you should try and write something in a less insulting and inflammatory way because your caveat was so buried in the rest of your diatribe that i entire missed it even when reading it carefullywhich makes it a pretty lame caveat and its not a proven fact that even on average its true you claim it but neither of us has the facts to actually calculate on averagetry to divert things all you like your facts are still nothing but opinions and probably coloured by what youd like to believe to be true
i believe that the last estimate was that 80 of players live in hisecit also appears to be true that they do not want to live in lowsec or 00 so trying to force them there by changing the game mechanics ie level iv mission locations will probably loose ccp paying customersfor the folk who like to repeat that eve is a pvp game  well it was but it is very clear that 80 of paying customers prefer hisec so lets add more content and regions to hisec  they are the billpayers more revienu means more development all regions
completely clearing wc and blockade are the 2 longest missions i know of their is also an l4 version of duo of death with 2 nice bs and a few towers
so the guy with the post full of inflammatory comments and who also fails to read what he is responding to properly now comes and accuses me of being inflammatory get a grip your desperate defense of high sec missions is based on attacking the posters of the opposing opinion rather than their arguments kindly stfu
supporting this cause words
keep the tech lab its saving ccp from having to field a lot of questions by making third party resource findable but ill also add my name to list that wishes the search was better its being low volume but high quality is so much better then the way most of the forums are that wed have to wade thru if we lost it
my thoughts for tiering sovereignty i started with the goals of1 tier of objectives for pvpers and industrialists to accomplish2 reduce the pos fuel maintenance grinding3 make 00 space less empty on a day to day basis4 make 00 more dynamic and reduce the ability for mega alliances to get rich just because they have the biggest blob but arent necessarily out there patrolling their space or even logging when there isnt a big opso here is my proposala make sov claims based on planet control remove need for moon coveragea this will reduce the number of pos by at least 66 probably more and therefore require a lot less in the way of pos maintenanceb this should free up the moon mining business for midlow materials to allow industrialists to handlec sieges will still be required but not be as agonizing slow to sweep through a systemb make small pos the only moon anchorable posa reduced shields and armaments will allow reasonable sized bs gang to interrupt moon mining operationsc introduce economic structures es that produce and consume trade goods or possibly the only way to complete moon mining reactionsa make a requirement that every planet pos have a es but that es is not on grid with posb es operates like a posc es has low shields so that a 10 man hac gang can disable in 20 minutes es has no defenses but will warp scramble anyone on grid that aggresses not based on standings the es it until help arrives eg alliance members or roaming defense gangs or shields are disabledd once shields are disabled production stops and production related requirements stop being consumed but other consumables continue to be required shields are automatically restored after 1 houre es involved trade goods cant be jumped no carriers jf jump bridges titan jumps etc this will reintroduce transports and industrials to 00f es have market system for producedrequired trade goods only alliances can have goods automatically moved to sell orders at specified prices after production completesg es have a max 2 week storage capability for both produced and required goods running out of required goods outs the associated planet pos into reinforced mode and removes it from system sov so 237 blockade could be used to take out a cyno jamming pos but that would be highly unlikely likewise produced goods would need to be removedsold at least every two weeks or further production is wastedh alliances can flag es for alliance only or use corpalliance standings to anywhere up to making it a true free port this allows affiliated both the controlling alliance and industrial corps to provideprofit from logisticsso not an overhaul of sov ie no need to remove cyno jammers but rather introducing a way for groups of all sizes to affect 00 and provide jobs for those crafty industrialists that find satisfaction running 00 for great profits
not trying to burst your bubble but youd need to rethink this onethe idea of detecting the warp signature is possible the destination could not be pin pointed as a ships warp drive is only limited by the capacity of its capacitor so you could detect it moving in a certain direction and its general position its moving faster than light so your scan results couldnt be accurate but youd not be able to pinpoint or guesstimate its final position unless you assumed that its moving in the direction of the station or somethingan interceptor could use a mod in the similar and detect when the bubble has dispersed and get a closer end destination but that would depend on if ccp thinks warp bubbles are scientifically detectablegood idea otherwise
to put it in 3 words  it will fail 
this is a fascinating and original idea i like using a speed tank rather than straight armorshield or resistances to give this ship survivability in fleet battles and the ships presence on the battlefield makes fleet battles more sophisticated friendly speed bonuses are an interesting idea especially with the upcoming nanonerf this warrants additional thought and discussionbalancing will be very challenging though it should be neither prohibitively expensive because it will get primaried in fleet battles nor easy to destroy since presumably it is a commanders ship nor overpoweredwhat about a bonus that grants the ship greater resistances the larger the number of ships receiving proximity speed bonuses under its pilots command to increase its survivability in progressively larger battles not to the degree that it could become unstoppable but enough to encourage an enemy to take out some of its underlings first to weaken it maybe not a good idea but throwing it out there
signedlots of interesting ideas fighting at the gatestation is boring it would be nice to see some manuevering and other options
cant see any other thread    any corp declaring war on a factional warfare player corporation should at the least be set upon by the faction it has in fact also declared war onthis would eliminate player corps leaving factions
not signedno special treatment for fw corps
this ones only been going on for a week
it would also do what the devs said they didnt want to do namely let established player alliances dominate and determine the outcome of fwof course the devs intent means squat obviously because you have csm members blatently sidestepping itway i see it the devs are going to have to do one of two thingstheyll either have to cave and allow alliances into fw in which case fw will become 00 jr and the same power players will control it or theyll have to exempt player corps involved in fw from being war targets to anyone other than others engaged in fwthe first option would pretty much kill fw tbh it would quickly escalate into uberblob cap fights and no longer be an alternative to 00 warfare itd just be more of the same the second option would be unfortunate but maybe unavoidable if the devs wish their original vision for fw as an alternative to 00 warfare to stand people it seems just cant keep their hands out of the cookie jar

edit stop  before posting please be aware that there has been a gm response to the issue in the thread where it was originally brought to the attention of the public that gm response can be found here meanwhile my original post here readin short it would appear that ccp has arbitrarily moved the few capital ships which existed in high security space out into low security space the reason for this sudden and shocking change in long established policy for these few ships is unclear indeed it would currently seem to be completely absent of good reasonthis is a cause for discontent amongst players as not only were all these ships already bound by noncombat rules but of special note is that one of the biggest positive contributors to the eve online community chribba is unfairly impacted by this move  as of course are the others alsoplease sign in support of the reversal of the sudden capital ship relocation decision by ccp so that the csm has cause to raise this matter for us to those who are responsible

supporting this
ccp whats happened to you i seem to remember you guys being about the game before the money guess you just got too big its not anger its just disappointment when you think something is special and it turns out to be just the same as all the others you really have to question whats the point chribba is not just another player and you should know that hes a living legend in eve and if thats not worth anything to you then i guess the only thing that you value is our money way to go
signedremarkably thoughtless move on ccps part
posting because ccp seem to be getting stupider every week in regard to decisions
whos wnk idea was this thena cheezy grin and thumbs up from me
leave chribba alone you farking tools and recognise your mistakes against someone who has done far more for eve than many of your employeesbring back the veldnaught besides wth is a capital gonna do in highsec with the rules that were already in place tzarrim

incredibly unnecessary action and without any announcement or explanationway to go ccpmy old ceo has had a naglfar in emolgranlan and every once in a while on sunday afternoon we would take it out for a spin within minutes ammold rookie starter system 1 jump away was basically rookie free and all came capital watching it was nice it hurt nobody and got people excited for capsstop changing things for changes sake
real life analogy would be removing the statue of liberty from new york or pyramids from egypt the remaining capitals in highsec space were landmarks and now ccp has bulldozed them please bring back the veldnaught to amarr and the rest of the landmarks of highsec where they belong

i have now flagged this as an issue which the csm will be discussing at the next possible meetingbut by all means keep supporting this so ccp gets the message
i fully support to move all the high sec capitals back they should not be removed from high sec unless the owner has committed a hostile act with them
most definitely supportedbring back the veldnaughtits the least ccp can do for chribba after all he has done for them ab
this has my support
no

moving the veldnaught out of amarr was and is unacceptablethe same goes for the other hisec capitals theyre relics of a bygone era and as such are a part of player history a history which is made utterly worthless if the goalposts are continually moved for no valid reasonshould those capital ships be used for exploitative reasons then by all means have them destroyed but in that unlikely event specific action is the only way forward not kneejerk blanket decisionsin summary put the damn thing back where it was where it belongs where it should be

me shakes fist in the air i never got my screenshot damn you ccpchribba has sacrificed his own skin to promote your game and this is how hes paid back by removing the iconic veldnaught from highsec space what are you planning on removing next is the entire amarr race moving to lowsec howabout we relocate all stations to lowsec nextsupported 100 anyone who comes here and doesnt support it should get an immediate wardec

whatever happened to player driven content eh
return them all or not at least try talking to the player base about it first

signedthis should be expanded to cover all highsec capitals that were effected not just one
a truly stupid move on ccps part and potentially damaging to the communityhopefully ccp will reverse this chribba best of luck matezach
signed
they moved the veldnaught and other high sec capitalsoh come on thats poo poo so many issues to be worked on in this game and theyre writing scripts to move all the caps out of high sec fhs
i agree
signed
the various high sec capitals add to the unique appeal of the game they suggest that there are ways for a player to leave their mark on the universe  and if a demigod with the gdp of a medium sized country cant make a mark then whats the point
theres no reason whatsoever for this move expecially given the exponential value of these handful of ships  which were already effectively castratedstupid move and a very costly one for anyone who paid through the nose for their highsec cap which is just an expensive lawn ornament anywaypointless
signed
for shame ccpi sincerely hope whoever thought up this boneheaded move is new since there is no excuse for anyone whos been around for longer

who gave the psycho the nerfbat
say it aint so bring back the veldnaught
we demand our veldnaught back

make it so
signed in a big wayconsidering how much chribba has done for the game and not done with his veldnaught such as shooting stuff in highsec the decision to pointlessly deposit his vessel somewhere other than amarr is just plain idiotic especially if there is no explination as to whyno exceptions to the rule see above no one has done more for eve and i mean for eve not just himself and his small group of friends that number in the thousands btw as one of the most trusted icons in the entire eve universe but for the whole of the playerbasehas some change been done to the game engine that cannot be bent for one dreadok build chribba a unique ship one that has the 999 resistances of the polaris boats but has all the look of his veldnaught that can reside in amarr to impress the masses
signed in bloodchribba is the most loved person in eve and has done amazing amounts for the eve community this is an idiotic and petty attack on eves most beloved pilotchribba has my full support
nooooooooo i havent have time to go to amarr jet to see it and now it is gone you devs are eviledit as they where more or less useless as they where not allowed to do any combat why move them move all of them back or at least give the pilots the option to have them moved back

my first encounter with the veldnaught is what made me convert my twoweek trial period into a paid accountplease dont remove something that makes eve a unique and interesting place
its a bloody landmark and it should damn well be moved back where it is removing the veldnaught is removing a part of eve history removing a monumentall the other highsec capitals should get returned to highsec too since theyre forbidden from engaging in combat there is no reason to kick them out of highsecjust a horribly stupid move ccpplayer made one too not some npc fluff
the janks is upset that something that little pieces that make eve unique are being taken away
signed with alts too
hi ccpyes were your players remember usset it rightsigned
bring it backnow 
i bet they honestly thought theyd get away with this
considering how much he has done for eve they could let him keep his dread in amarr wouldnt be surprised if he decided that hey hosting all the useful eve sites that most players use daily just aint worth the trouble anymore wouldnt blame him either
srsly
icons like privately owned capital ships in high sec give the game a sense of developing history and should be treated as such put them back in their rightful placesrivqua

stupid decision
ccp time to take your meds again signed
signed
does anyone have a link to where ccp made an official statement about thisi for one agree that it is cool that certain dreads were in high sec i passed chribba once and we had a short exchange of pleasentries the others dreads i have not seen they should bring the select few back considering the mechanics that did not let them pew pewthe only way i could even start to think of supporting this decision was if ccp role played an econominc or social reason why concord and the two racial alliaces all argrred on to remove all reaming high sec dreadnoughts out of secure spacehope ccp reverses this decisionslade
signed for all highsec capitals
they hurt noone and where icons of eve bring em back
i support this i can see no benefit to the game as a whole or the playerbase for removing a handful of benign capitals left behind in high sec nothing that could justify this outrage to a player who enjoys far more respect than the company or the game itself doesnothing short of an apology for a collosal blunder made and an offer to reverse this move completely or else full 100 disclosure of precisely how this will improve the game massively will do to justify this move
give the pilotsthe choice if they want them moved back to empire or notbut on the point of the veldnaught it was truly a landmark it was an inspiration for us all it spread so much love
ccp you are doing some very stupid things lately and if you keep it up the game wont last move the veldnaught to high sec again
i just dont see what fecking harm it or any high sec dreadcarrier was doing already rules against using them why move them bs

at least a comment by ccp devs can complain about a sometimes hostile atmosphere on the forums all they want its partly down to them communication even less will not change this unless you want to wait till the last person quits eve
hmpfh not cool
sometimes you would expect that ccp thinks before they act move the veldnought back
signednice to see no dev response here sarcasm off
agreedthe veldnaught has become a legend unto intself and is one of the more interesting icons to tell and show new players to evethe removing of the few remaining capitals that were living in peace was not required they were not hurting anyonei do not remember seeing a thread started about someone saying they were negatively impacting their game playput them back
totally signed these ships were the best ways to get newer pilots excited about some day owning a cap ship seeing a gm in such a ship from time to time is just not the sameand for the record i have never seen a cap and ive been playing for a couple of years now  and thanks to this i will almost certainly never see one

terrible idea to move them in the first place this is definitely signed
1ccp stated that all lsaas in highsec and all highsec capital ships would be fine then did a 180 on this not once but twice and yet somehow managed to end up facing the wrong way
i support this issueparis wouldnt be the same if the eiffeltower was in the banlieus
uhh crappy move ccp way to really tick off the player base and one heck of a loyal player  community member
oh my fix it 
seriously this was pointless lots of missionrunning residents of highsecurity space got their only look at capitals this way they already couldnt engage in combat besides they wouldnt have wanted to anyway im guessing concord would have been capable of taking them out if requiredtheres no reason for this change in my opinion and think it terrible that the community had to be notified by one of the victims to even know about it

put the veldnaught and all the other hisec dreads back like the nonni moros they do far more good for the game in hisec than theyll ever do in lo or null in highec they provide the last vestage of awe as you fly past in your little cruiser  battleships just dont do that anymoreand no excuses about not showing favor to anyone of course you should favor some people especially when they go above and beyond the call of duty in service to the gameshame ccp on the short sighted move

i never thought id post in a csm thread but i have to support this oneive never seen a highsec cap although id love to nor have i seen any of the other wonders in eve that players have built titans just to give one example if its no longer gamemechanically possible for them to exist in highsec then fine but lets see a dev blog telling us whats changing in the game mechanics that make it so instead of having hoursdays of indigation by your player baseyes it happened to cribba and so this cause has a leader they can rally around to protest but it isnt any less of a slap in the face to anyone else that had a highsec cap and was living by the imposed and for the most part selfenforced rules to keep themits not a player sandbox anymore when the parents take away all the toys  get a grip ccp and either tell your playerbase why you had to do this or give us the toys back  we deserve at least that much respect

gm reply on post 888
thumbs up
bring back the veldnaught
this is the kind of bonehead move that really should get people fired for proposingauthorizing it
i once asked who chribba is and saw that he was good i saw resentment in others feeling he was getting special treatment i saw this was not true he got special treatment from players  thats what i sawand regarding all items of history they should be returned how many games can you look at that echo its past via user created landmarks not many how wonderous is it to look upon these things see they were done and then wonder what will be the future for yourself so if you see that the past is erased in eve will you be so inclined to make a future anyway some might not
signed i always wanted to go and see the veldnaught special things or oddities just make the universe more interesting ccp can change the rules or make judgement calls in situations like this and yet they choose to please a vocal minority who would likely never quit over this issue seriously you care about a mining ship that muchits more than possible to safely make more isk than a mining dread can with cheaper ships as for safety it would have just been that much cooler if someone actually did pull off an operation that successfully lead to his destruction this is a very disappointing decision
give us our historic icons back
give me a tractor drone and i could care less about a salvage drone but hey if they want to make both bonus
needs to be more interactive and you dont have to punish people with this you can have a little popup message that says youve noticed a little concentration of ore off to the lateral side of the asteroid do you want to narrow the focus your lasers to take advantage of increased yeild for a few cycles if you dont it just happily mines away at the standard rate if you do you get rewarded with an increased yeild amount per laser and maybe a bonus amount of another oremining lasers theres no reason these shouldnt have the capacity to be overloaded for cycle time or ore amount or bothnew ships yeah the hulk is great the rorqual makes an ok transport vessel but you cant mine in it in a game that has combat ship varieties that stretch from interceptor to titan the spread of mining ships is wellpathetic mining frigs mining cruisers  mining barges  exhumers  rorqual there should be at least another class of ship in between hulk and rorqual that is able to mine make it as skill intensive as you want but give it the ability to have at least 3 strips and a couple of turrets and have utility slots to be able to remote tank other vessels and a decent cargohold capacity edit syntax
mining is the most ed boring pathetic etc profession in the game i tried it for a bit but there is not a dam thing to do its eves dirty little secret of worst gameplay possiblethis is a game and with that in mind anything can be made fun
1 if youre a solo flyer mining can be boring however with any organization of a corp this can be entertaining in many ways while you wait for your miners to cycle2 its one skill book more than the covetor you can be in one in less than 50d if you specialize into t2 crystals maybe a few more days with exception of the high end non 00 ores345 i dont expierence these i just experience getting blown up however i wouldnt mine in empire as the iskhr just isnt worth it i prefer mining for 50  75m hr not 5mhr and have to deal with this can flippingthieve issue i actually dont know what it is6 i dont see how this is something that needs to be fixed since when in the history of the world is mining any mineral a solo operation yes you can do it alone and it takes longer more people sharing the work and you get done faster
id like to see this cant seem to slim my cache enough just got wasted while sitting on endless load upon exiting a station by some tard who thought i was willingly sitting around eyeballing him to death
but of course i see there is a cache purging option already but it also flushes all your bookmarks which makes it largely useless
actually agents are receiving funding from their dominant corporations because players are performing services on their behalfagents are assigned to various locations to take up residence and make friends they talk to the travelers that pass through gathering rumors and listening to tales told over a pintthen they wait for someone with a reputation for getting errands done and pass along the info people have been having a problem in this area go clean it up and well pay you for your troubleif agents took up residence in pos or outposts1 there wouldnt be random travelers passing through the only info would come from corpalliance personnel who frequent the station2 agents would start gathering info like everytime a wandering pilot happens to pass through this stargate they get ganked by the local hoodlums except you are the hoodlumin short theres nothing for an agent to make a mission out of except for trying to thwart your own activities
missions are the vast majority of the time aimed at killing pirate faction rats belt rats exist in 00 and so we can infer that pirate factions exist in 00 therefore theres people to kill in 00 that arent pcs and therefore missions make sense
when i thought of this topic it wasnt to put more focus on them it would be to eliminate level 4s altogether in highsec and make them lowsec00 onlybut to do that youd need a redistribution system and what better way to redistribute them than this imagine the moaning
give them the damned agents they will stop whining for a week
moving lvl4 and up agents to 00 or evenlowsec only would accomplish either one of the following1 everybody moves to 00 empire empties except for miner carebears2 everybody in empire becomes a miner carebear3 everybody that used to make their isk in empire doing missions to fund various 00lowsec operations becomes broke4 some kid shoots his brains out leaving a note eve online killed me whereupon his parents ofcourse sue ccp because the thought that they themselves couldnt raise their child properly just doesnt occur to them and they win the lawsuit because the kid and parents were from the usa and thus ccp is broke and eve online seizes to exsistnow tbh not one of those scenarios looks appealing to me except for the last one ofcourse where the boy dies but thats just me also i like the thought that if i ever decide to just leave 00 and become semiactive i can always have some fun and make some isk in empire on the odd times i actually am online by doing lvl4 missions
only because deep 00 has no training ground for new recruits jumping straight into double and triple bs rats is hard on a newb i would pay for a level 1 agent out in our space
noobs dont belong out in 00 space thats precisely what high sec is there for to show them the ropes to get them used to gameplay and combat and so forth any rookie who just sets course and heads for 00 is only looking for heartacheall these 00 pirates are looking for is a way to make a few isk while they wait to gank each other a way for a few of them to pass the time while the others probe down the mission runners and kill them and steal their wrecks
ive played both sides of this cardi think we need to do whatever would encourage more people to rat in low sec and mine in low sec targets or opportunities to make isk in low sec depending on your version of eve are being coming harder to come bymore often than not a outing of some relaxing pvp is disrupted by a blob of other people trying to get some relaxing pvpmostly blobbed because engauging something on a gate in anything less than a t2 ship or t2 fitted ship solo is suicide there are characters that rely upon the gateguns as half their dps in pvp see ami on any weekday night attack the thorax on the gate then watch the gank mega appearthe gate guns are becoming too much of a crutch for some and a hinderance for others ccp bring back benefits for carebears who brave low sec give them greater rewards and stop punishing the pvpers who attempt to educate the carebears on the ways of low sec living
well i personally would have to disagree with youright now as it is someone in a broadsword yes ive seen it done ive been blown up by it can just gatecamp a 04 system at 0m from the gate and shoot stuff upi do not believe ccp ever intended one person to just be able to pirate gatecamp a 04 system gate or atleast i really hope soi totally agree that lowsec guns need boosting
my god man what failure of a ship were you flying to die to a lone broadsword on a gateanything frigate sized can warp off before the broadsword gets a lockany battlecruiser with a reasonable fit can kill an agressed broadsword or tank long enough to jump through the gate hint free 350 dpsbattleships are in the same position as the battlecruiserwhich leaves cruiser hulls which can ewar burn away from tank or gank free 350 dps said broadsword depending on specific shipif you died in an unscouted haulermining ship then its your own fault for being silly a fool and his isk are soon partedsentry gun dps is fine
add in a warp to 200km and id support this
i still like the idea of forcing fleet structure for capitalsfor instance 1 removing the ship bonuses like 99 reduction to fitting doomsday weapons2 adding in their place the ability to borrow cpu from fleetmatesthen all the cpu theyd have for fitting would come from the shared resources of the fleet beneath them if you want a titan with a dd then you need a fleet gathered with at least 10000 cpu to spare if you want carriers to have drone control units thats 7500 cpu eachi realize this isnt so much a maintenance issue like the op suggests but it is a form of control to make sure that fleets arent relying solely on deploying a dozen titans to wipe out the oppositionehh
the biggest problem with current capital warfare as far as i can tell is the fact that supercapitals can fight without committing a titan has impact for 15 seconds an hour so you hide it for the other 5945 itd be like a carrier launching fighters in the persian gulf and jumping to lake michigan until it was time to recover them  of course combat looks degenerate under those conditions dreadnoughts are the ones that dont work this way and as such theyre actually quite wellbalanced they do one thing very very well  blow up large immobile targets  they do not obsolete battleships and they have to commit for 10 minutes if they want to do much of anything and do so in a fashion that means they can be popped with relative ease by an opposing fleet carriers and motherships are similar except that they have the ability to remote rep which makes them virtually invincible in large groups the obvious solution is a massive nerf to capital logistics modulesmake them 152x as big as battleship ones instead of the current 34x with a corresponding massive buff to the triage module make logistics much better if youre willing to commit to a fight where you can die and much worse if youre not titans are the most obvious problem and the solution has to be on the doomsday itself since the ship propers only problem is that it does nothing except mount a ddd or a jump bridge and 20 other modules to help out the one chosen yaays thread from a while back had some good ideas on this  mostly on the theme of making them effects over a period of time that dont just nuke things  but really any solution that makes ddds not instapop support fleets and that makes titans linger instead of fleeing would help greatlyyes i realize that was a bit of a tangent it is however the only reasonable solution i see to capital proliferationon the topic of your original proposal i dont think it can be made reasonable to all of the myriad ways capital ships are used you have fleet titans that get used daily and vanity dreadnoughts that sit in amarr with miner iis on any proposal for upkeep fees that would hit the former group would cripple the latter and any that would be reasonable to the latter would go nighunnoticed by the former i dont think you can make it work
after almost since day one i have been a part of the eve online universe it saddens me the first time i was not reimbursed after warping away and slowly dyeing for 4 minutes 12 au from invisible attackers and unable then to lock them back all u get is a sorry but our policy is to punish everyone since there is no logs on our sidei have tested games when very young worked later as developerlevel designer as well as animation rigging ect i have a reel good idea of what i did wrong when i loose a ship what is not my fault please check 0utbreak killboard for stats on losses and ull get the point i know i have lost approximately 320 hrs worth of ships to serverlag related problems that if id had a ccp member sitting next to me would understand with there own eyes im not lying and its wrong for 6 years or so uve just said sry but the problems are still there u dont fix them and u still punish the innocent since  there are many people who would take advantage  u admit here u punish the innocent u admit to me that the last place i was enjoying posses i find too lagy for inties fleet fights over 50 v 50 and century fire in faction warfare when flying inties with lag in a lev 4 mission area i shouldnt be ie move since even now this area fails to the 300 people the severs cant cope with every avenue i enjoy of the game has been broken by numbers now the way i used to get my isk back is also broken when u return to ur agent after 2 failed for annoying reason petitions and find u have the problem all over again there is no corner of the game that has not turned belly up for me that i enjoyi have supported u from day one but after this final loop of flying a well set up ship  loose to lag bugs  some u dint even want to know about since it was a new one and then try get money back and loose ships with 25 min delays on lev4s leaves me with nothing left to enjoy and no way of making isk with ought moving my hole armada of ships salvagers and mods i have 300 mill left to pay on the lent ship to do missions and aprox 2 kills left for toxins number one solo killer my accounts are cancelled and the month i have left should be amplemy advice to u is watch ur ankles i take this quite personally since i felt i have done nothing wrong other then try to play ur game and in the 5 years since my first petition u have not changed your policy and must understand that there will be many innocent people u take advantage of with ought reimbursing i wish u good luck on solving some of the bigger issues u have with this game that would allow reel time fun game play back and curse every time u avoided these to attract new players my reel advice to u is think a bit about the people u screw over with ur policy now instead of having an old time supporter always up for fighting in ninja fashion and helping promote ur game u have a very angry badger burrowing threw the ground heading for ur home land pull up ur socks and watch out for ur ankles i am omw to eat u allsubscriptions closed  no no no u cant have my stuffthanks for all the good times but remember the times u said im sry and did nothing when ur bones are being exposed

helloi just detected this thread eve online usability reportit is the best list of usability issues that i have seen so far in evebut what use has a buglist if ccp devs are not looking at itseveral of these issues are quite annoying and not that difficult to fixi play eve now for about 2 years and most of these issues have been there from day 1there is no improvement in this area and well we actually pay a monthly fee to get maintanance it is sad enough that such a list has to come from the player community and not from the qa devs paid for that jobso please bring this issue up and bring this buglist to their attention a comment from a dev in that thread would be a good startregardseve g
getting drowned out in less important issues
i need clarification here on a few thingsa what is the fastest time a ship can possibly be probed any single warp will make the fastest time with your method much slower than the fastest time with the current methodb how accurate will clicking be will you be able to click with a 0m accuracy which can be gained with the current probing systemconsidering warping times it will be impossible to get a fix on a target warping between safespots using your method because you would have to warp as well in order to get lines 2 and 3 also considering modern detection systems why wouldnt it be possible to get an accurate read on a position of an object with a single scan like we can in the modern era direction response time response time translates to distance due to fixed speed of the ping response strengthalthough i would love to be able to zoom my system map in more sometimes objects are within 1000000km or less of each other and that is very hard to distinguish in the solar system map
what im looking for however is a reduction in the warp distance from a specific object i wont lie to you  i want to drop on top of a jetcan within 1500m so that i can open it and scoop the lootas it is i usually appear within 2000m of the jetcan and need to approach it to steal from it its not bad in most ships but when youre trying to steal something in an industrial its close to impossible to do if the owner is paying attentionwhat im asking for is the ability to train the skill so that the distance from a warpable object can be reduced obviously the skill exists or once existed and for one reason or another its not being used
i think thats exactly what herschel meant too if it is possible id like to see this implemented as well i do a lot of jetcan mining and trying to get on top of my jetcan with an industrial especially when there are belt rats around is very annoying and a little dangerous i agree if possible you should be able to train to warp to within 1500mif not herschels idea of faster acceldecel when entering and exiting warp is also a great idea
wow imagine a world where a jetcan miner and a ninja salvagerlooter can agree on a topic its its beautifulme wipes away a tear
signed i like the ideawhen i am warping back to stuffships objectsi would like to be able to warp directly on top of it instead of overshooting if you have a ship with a faster warp speed it seemingly takes forever to get back to whatever it is that you just warped to tt

signeduntrashable station containers are so annoying
im sure this has been suggested before but with fixing the nano problem in mind why not create a web bubble just like a dictor bubble but 35 web instead multiple bubbles stack so now when youre fleet is getting nanod you tell your dictors to drop web bubbles so you can shoot the nanos
the reason nanoing works is that webs are shorterranged than scrams unless youre proposing 25km web bubbles this proposal will do very little also this wouldnt change empire pvp at allsince dictors cant bubble thereand it would have the unfortunate side effect of making piloting matter a lot in a game whose controls cannot handle it also the thing about catching nano ships is that you have to be faster than they are to get them webbed webbing yourself does not help with that at all even if the bubble was 99 nifty suggestion but i dont think its viable
any kind of aoe web effect used in conjunction with bubbles would be overpowered simple as that
indeed it would and it would harm interceptors and close range boats too
make them limit all speed to 500 ms or another arbitrary number
or effect based on signature radius
you would only be able to deploy one at a time wow look at that simple fix
because of the existing game mechanics which prevent multiple interdictors from operating in the same system at the same time right
as you can see in this thread all high sec capitals were removed from empire to lowseci think this is an unnessesary harsh policy shown by ccp the high sec caps were no threat to anybody as they were ruled under non combat regulations and there were only like 10 or so i demand that those high sec capitals including chribbas veldnought are to be restored to their old high sec locations
sry i did not see that there was allready another thread openplease do not reply to this one but take that one
personally i prefer to just give my support to both
supporting in the second thread
indeed its the only way sme people will ever see a dreadnaught heheapprove o
full support give this mak his veldnaught back
just in case ccp has gone stupid all of a sudden as they appear to be i will issue my support in this thread as well just to be sure
supported in both threads
so lame the veldnaught was one of those icons of eve
supported both threadsuse the nerfbat on the dev who did this not chribba seriously
all the more votes the bettergoonbomb the forums hey it worked once they took the forums down for a day demanding that the single most respected and trusted icon in eve be treated accordingly i mean hell when winterblink wrecked his car ccp sent him a care package what does chribba get for all that he does and spends on supporting eve a kick in the teeth
ccp you suck for doing thisundo it
stop before postingthere is an existing thread here for this issue please post in support of this issue there
supporting this in the vain hope ccp will stop killing everything unique in this game
edit meh i should read before i post this is not the sanctioned thread
dbl support 
adding to the duplicate thread in the hope that it gets locked so that i can deliver this message to ccp mitnalwe know you guys are reading the forums ccp navigator edited some posts in the main thread in gdwhy no official commentits really depressing
so dumb
second front opened on ccp
bring them back
signed let atleast chribba keep his
gm replied to the thread chribba started any of the hi sec caps that were moved may petition to have them returned so long as they play by the rules set down in that thread
this is quie pathetic understanding this has already been reversed but rly peoplestop ting up the forums with crusdaes for other people
ccp gave them back
i dont think the problem was them being used in an agressive way i keep hearing something to the tune of aggression by capital ships in high sec iswas punishable by removal of offending capital to lowsec whether this was done by a script or by direct gm intervention i do not know
well the fact of the matter is we have no idea why they ninja moved all the remaining high sec caps into low sec about the only game mechanic related reason and tbh the only real reason is that one day the cap ship owner could just say  it wardec some newb corp and go blow up a bunch of ships and then lol at ccp for letting them keep thier cpa ship in high sec as they cancel thier account so this is aimed at defanging the effected caps so they are truely useless at anything but mining ore in belts
i beleive onlining guns and such already got you concorded if them even having power gets you blown up i fail to see how they could be used aggresively anyway
apparently it was not all of them at least two people have chimed in to report their caps are still in high sec i have not heard of even a single other person reporting that their cap was movedso at the moment it looks like it was specific to the veldnaught
increase repshield transfer range to 100kmdiscuss
logistics are reasonably balanced as is i dont really think they need buffing atm
actually theyve already done that you just have to train up a ship designed for logistics
the aptly named logistics class of ships have a 714km range when using large remote reppers is that not enough
obviously not if im proposing for more rangelogistics reps up to 72km not 100
and why do you think logistics need this buff 
im guessing hes tired of being primaried and popped in a fight and he wants to hang back even more
if anything i would say a bigger drone bay or a bandwidth reduction to go with the drone bonus having 100 bonus on 23 light repper drones is still kinda sad 
pretty much seeing as how thats the logistics role
unlikely this will ever go through in light of what has happened to chribba  the other high sec cap ship pilots but ive been thinking about this for a while and now seems as good a time as any to post what i thought was that once someone has built an impressive standing with a particular faction that they should be trusted enough by that faction to be allowed capital ships in their space maybe even a graduated permission like 98 standing for small caps 100 for supercapsall those capital ships would be bound by a nonaggression policy violation resulting in concord pulling out their planet class ships that can pop a titan in a couple of hitsmaybe also limited to only being able to cross the lowhigh sec divide once per 24 hours to stop people from gathering in high sec jumping into lownil and then jumping back to protect themselves from retaliationjust would be nice to get some kind of recognition of reaching very high levels of standing with a faction other than a warm glow and also give those of us who are empire huggers something to aim for once we have a fleet of marauders in the hangar
just nocaps in highsec should be unique landmark things which not just any alt who has been grinding faction can get98 doesnt take that long and 100 is still possible although needs a lot more effort
check out cosmos missions also a titan in jita even if it took 100 standing would be the most abusive thing evar corp chat everyone undock and lootbe the most impressive km many of them every had
your idea is so senior
1 remove learning skills2 add 10 too all attributes 10 learning skillnow we got this plague off my game ive rank 1 learnings all at level5 and rank 3 at level4 and i dont give a damn if i loose that sp learning sux hardcore big time for new players
so youre 13 done and are willing to reap all the benefit for free how magnanimous of you
learning skills exist so as to increase the speed at which sps are gained therefore rather than call for yet more unpopular learning skills surely a simpler solution is to just ask ccp to increase the rate at which sps accrue accross the board
well sollution to removing would be simple add skillpoints that got removed to pool and you train 2x faster skills using sps from pool until all are taken from that pool 
i support the idea of making skills train faster across the board maybe make a 1020 increase in speeds but i dont think that we need any more learning skills thoughand those who say that charisma is not needed last i checked there is a load of social and trade skills as well as leadership if you dont need those skills dont take a character with high charisma if you do take that char end of discussion
i support this only because i have 3 chars with maxed out learning its a bad idea for that game and will never go liveccp has previously stated they will never add more learning skills although they also previously stated they wanted to remain a unique game which they are rapidly moving away from toward the mainstream of massive fail so who knows
how about removing the skills and instead boosting training speeda reduces the entry curve i remember spending my first month on them and has since then spent another oneb reduces the cost for skills for new playersc this makes the attribute choices more important making different characters less similarreplace the skill points spent by spreading them equally on every other skill that character has
well the fact remains that i still have spent 2months time getting those up newer players wont have to worry if i had had this benefit i wouldve had sp in other stuff instead
at a glance im seeingthis would also give more for small gangs to do instead of just shooting up station facilities also a good idea in general well done
someone from csm please ask ccp what rewards they plan for fw ranks
tactical repositioning  mwdfighting  abironically most speed users thinking an ab  death will actually be fairing much much better in combat as long as webs are nerfed and there was much rejoicing
i have to agree that the system is brutal it tries to mirror life and life is brutal and realyou can get hurt and you can be killed just by walking out your door here it is if you undock it is why we have to pay attention in rl and have to do so heresimple maxim to remember do not undock unless your ready to lose your ship and its kitif you never undock then you never have to worry about getting shot you will just stagnant same for real life take no chances and you will be nothing and accomplish nothing

while id like to think that the outcry from the forum concerning the unnannounced removal of all capital ships from high sec to low sec with no explanations given by anyone from ccp to date as to why the changes were implemented regarding the current assembly hall post about reinstating the veldnaught and other high sec capitals with 150 support posts in less than 6 hours after the change was discovered and climbing does lead to the conclusion that there must be a method of speeding up the wheels of bureaucracy within both the csm and with csmccp communication
is ridiculous it is not a csm issue
when you consider that in less than 8 hours this problem has attracted 300 support posts in the assembly hall not including those who supported but didnt check the support box not to mention a 400 post thread in gd you tend to come to the conclusion that this is an issue that the playerbase feels strongly about hence while you believe that its not a csm issue 300 others disagree and that number is still climbing rapidlypersonally im of the belief that this shouldnt need to be a csm issue as ccp could easily post their reasons for making this change out of the blue however the silence from ccp both prior to and after this change may necessitate it becoming one not because of this particular issue but because if we dont speak out when a change like this is dropped upon the game without explanation then whats to stop ccp dropping an unannounced change onto something you do care about
yes 300 support posts which could just be as low as 50 or so if people vote with alts and other characters on their accountlets assume every vote there is an individual player 300 people care thats nothing and objectively speaking their issue is a really a nonissue
absolutely correct its not a csm issueadditionally the csm does not need a csm only forum for discussion here on the eveo forum if you desire a csm only forum then create a website yourselves and populate it with the topics you see fit and discuss those topics you see fit in privateedit to remove anything that may be deemed controversial
nonsense the csm has authority to question and advise ccp on any and every issue related to eve this certainly qualifies
jc flies a falcon nerf

supported t2 ammo is inferior to faction ammo by a significant margin and often is inferior to its t1 equivalents my 02isk is that the cap and speed penalties should be removed from all faction ammo and t2 heavy missiles should have their range penalty removed as well these penalties are simply too severe i would never use rage missiles on any ship i pilot and the dps penalty for precisions make them useless more often than not
completely agree

agreeing 100 point for point bo bs are expensive as hell especially for roaming gangs they need optimal far more than they need dps especially since they cant warp cloakedfrom day 1 of thinking on the t2 scorp i wanted it to be rails  ecm at range it would even provide a thoughtprovoking tradeoff  both would require noticeable cap you can indefinitely sustain one or the other but not both unless you fit for it lose a mid with a cap booster lose an ecm str mod with a damage mod etc give it 5 turretsthe redeemer should have just 75 optimal and because of its 6 turrets it wont be dealing amazing dps but it can fit more mods for it than the widow making it more useful and with pulse  scorch can get some good ranges with a fairly nice passive tankfor the panther im clueless falloff is  and unless you turn it into a muninn knockoff lol it wont accomplish much after the nano nerf i might go as far as to say give it the missile bonuses because large projectiles are just crap butyeah i want to say move a mid to a low but i have little experience toying with the panthers setupsreplace the sins agility bonus seriously what with a drone range bonus a la ishtar however leave the sin with the shortest targeting range so you either fit to use heavies at range with a slight tank or you fit to use sentries at longer range with less tank i want to say move a mid to a low again but i have equally little experience with the sins setupsand if youre going to leave them with 20 less base hp give them better t2 resists for the love of god preferably in line with or better than the marauders but probably less than the cloaky recons 4020 sounds good to mealso spare room in drone baysalso also increase the fittings dont need more slots just more fittings to actually use them not including widow which has plenty of fittings for ecmwhatever
so less blackops and more haulingops reallyits got to be one thing or another try to make it all things to all people and itll end up either overpowered or uselessly broken statwise instead you could eithermake it an escort ship by removing the cloak bonuses giving dsts access to the bridges a fuel bay increased jump range and either a small fighter bay or logistics ship level remote reps but a maximum of only two targetsmake it a blackops ship by giving them all ew bonuses covert ops cloaks low dps the covert only jump bridge a fuel bay and increased jump rangemake it a rapidresponse ship boost the dps to standard bs levels drop the cloak give hacs and deny recons access to the bridges add a fuel bay and increase the jump rangetheir survivability will never be as high as a capital shiptheir flexibility will never be as high as a carrier shiptheir cost efficiency will never be as high as a t1 bstherefore they have to have something extraa minicarrier with cargologistics is unique and valuable on and off the battlefielda bs covops is to recons as the marauder is to hacsa rapidresponse ship is a poor excuse for a hotdropping or fleet carrier but allows you to get support ships in fast when and where they are neededthe theme is that t2 is the step up from t1 in either combat features or functionality t3 4 and 5 should probably be equal to but different to t2 providing greater variety for veterans therefore i see very little wrong with making t2 bs superior to t1 so long as it stops there and does not continue on up to t5 if this were the issue some make it out to be wed see eccm fitted overheating marauders in fleets all over the place if we ever do then the problem is more likely to be the economy than the shipswhat we dont need is a ship class that is pulled out for jumping haulers around and then shelved again if thats what we really want then we need haulers with jumpdrives

2 hours for damsel that should take you about 2530 mins maybe 45 if youre not very good
god this tired old argument80 of characters in hisec does not repeat not mean that 80 of players want to be hisec exclusivelyone possible interpretation is that many 00 players come to hisec to make isk for instance like i dowhich is you know kind of the point of this thread
nah about 2 hrsi already suggested that ccp should just double the hps damage and resistances of all npcs in the game making highspeed isk farming from missions much harder if not virtually impossiblenot much as in none support for it thus the ops request is simply metagriefing i do not in principle oppose metagriefing but at least be honest about it
i for one am absolutely content living in highsec i usually try to have fun when i play and lowsecnullsec just is not fun for me moving level 4 missions wont make me go there more it will simply make me stop running themyou cant just move the entire game into nullsec of course you guys want more action but what about eves versatility leave some room to the casual players to have some fun in highsec without getting blown to pieces every bloody minutejust my feelings
thats odd there is a persistent rumor going around saying that nullsec is way more profitable than highsec and that if you want to really earn some serious isk you have to go there you mean all that is just a big lie if you come to highsec to make isk what do you do in nullsecoh wait i get it you come to highsec to make isk and nullsec is for having fun blowing everything to shreds including yourself occasionally  so you have to go back to highsec to make isk in essence moving level 4 missions to nullsec would spare you the bother of a trip to highsec and hopefully bring forth more untrained cannon fodder for yousorry for the sarcasm i am just wondering what exactly do you propose to achieve by moving level 4 missions to nullsec i mean really would it not just be a convenience for players already well set up in nullsec by the way you guys have chosen to live in nullsec just as i have chosen to live in highsec get to grips with what that choice pertains to you cant have highsecs advantages moved to nullsec for you
as a 00 resident and a casual high sec player i have to give this a thumbs downpirates would have a field day more targets and an easy way to raise sec standing just run missions in lowsec i think there would be a large increase in pirate activity greatly increasing the risk i dont think we need to change the way ore is distributed right now having more valuable ore in lower security systems seems finei havent done much rp in eve so cannot really comment on the rp reasons
so you commute to losec because thats the best place to earn isk safely why dont you just get another account to run missions in hisec and keep your main in 00 like everybody else maybe life in 00 isnt for you if you cant be bothered to deal with the risks and prefer the carebear life in hisec
are you dumb
aww now the alt goes away and the real pirate comes out to playi dont run missions i have no vested interestyoure a pirate your vested interest is more targets in places you can gowhich one of us is unbiasedoh i dont shut up because of abuse by loud mouths trying to shout people down with obvious facts which are in fact entirely unsubstantiated opinions that also happen to support a hidden agendayou doperhaps your claims are true numbers but you cannot prove it and my experience says otherwise so you certainly cannot prove it to me without actual statistics that you probably dont have access tomissions do need some fixing and attention but moving them out to serve the interests of pirates whining for easy ganks isnt the way to go about itif you cannot debate civilly then please dont bother to attempt it at all youre only embarrassing yourself
discussed to death ccp need to give us a definitive answer so we can all get back to our elives
look you bozo i was discussing this civilly until you started getting your panties in a twist and throwing around accusations and assumptions ive been discussing this from a stand point of common sense something which you are obviously lacking in you are obviously heavily biased in this discussion as you have not been arguing properly at any point in the discussion instead you have been picking on small stuff trying to poke holes in arguments by discussing strawmen and irrelevant stuffim not a flippin low sec pirate look at my security status im a high sec dweller who happens to like shooting stuff i dont gate camp i dont do belt piracy anymore i dec idiots with too much cash and relieve them of it moving missions to low sec would not affect me in any positive way in the short run it would deprive me of my safe primary income however i recognize that drastic measures need to take place and i would not be opposed to moving missions to lowsec however i believe  as ive stated multiple times  that a much better option would be to just nerf high sec mission rewards drastically this would balance them enough so that you bears can keep your safe fun and at the same time balance out the economybefore you go blathering about me wanting this or that try to read some of my friggin posts and see where i stand on the issue stop attacking people and start attacking their arguments just frappin stopcant say shorter word for intercourse cause it got me banned last time
epithets get you no points and no respectobviously your definition of civilly and mine are entirely different im sorry youre all upset because i called you on your facts and asked you to back up your claims which you clearly cannot do or you would have by nowgetting all mad insulting and foul mouthed about it isnt earning you any points or convincing anyone of your position ive given you numerous opportunities to do that and youve not taken even a single one perhaps you really dont have an agenda that claim was made by others who apparently know you better than i and in this same thread  i simply accepted it because their arguments unlike yours made sense given your behaviour which has become quite rude and defensive im afraid im far more likely to believe them then youpresenting facts or at least detailed personal experiences which can be discussed in a mature way is the way to make a point not claiming that your position is obvious when at least to some it very clearly is noti am done wasting my time with you

i agree with the op there needs to be more reward and incentives for fw to be worth whilesome fw specific rewards would be pretty cool too
i dont see any reason why fw corps should be treated differently than independant corps what makes a corp enlisted in the militia  and therefore likely to be a pvp corp based in lowsec and surrounded by allies who could choose to come to their defense  less able to fend for themselves than a independant nonpvp corp that is completely on their owni wouldnt mind seeing some revision of the wardec system with changes designed to prevent outandout endless griefing but i cant see the logic in giving special treatment to fw corps
ok ill bite and give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you dont really understand the implications why would a corp especially one who belongs to existing player alliance want to sign up for fw when they can just wardec one of the major corps that is engaged in fw in case you have a hard time figuring it out doing the latter allows them to carry the fight into enemy highsec space without interference from that factions navy thus completely sidestepping the mechanics of fw while working to influence the outcome of itso short answer to your question is that they may need to do it to protect the integrity of fw even though yes the side effect of it would suck thats what happens when you have wiseguys in the game who lay awake at night trying to think of ways around things
i do not claim to know all of the people enlisted in fw or all of the corpsalliances who have wardecd those corpsthat said all of the alliances i do know of that have wardecd fw corps are roleplaying alliances example electus matari i for one would not be willing to disband my alliance that cost me a billion isk to create just to play fw so if i were in their position id wardec the corporations on the other side as wellalso not everybody who wardecs an fw corp gives a damn about fw  i for one wouldnt look to see if someone was in fw or not before i wardecd them if i have a reason to dec im gonna decpart of being in a corporation is the risk of wars wars inconvenience you even in highsec which is safer not safe  they havent completely nerfed risk out of the game yet a corp that willingly jumps into fw doesnt need to consider the possible risk of wardecs they shouldve considered it when they made or joined a player corp to begin with
you do not have to disband an alliance to participate in fw corps within the alliance can leave temporarily and participate individuals can leave temporarily and participate but they should do so under the same set of mechanics that everyone else participating in fw must abide by doing so makes perfect sense from a rp point of view why are you going to squabble out on the frontier when your core empire is under attack of course youre going to go enlist and help your empires fleetno not everyone who wardecs a fw corp is trying to participate in fw without joining it but some people are and they have said so on these forums unfortunately the devs have no way to tell them apartthe devs do not want existing alliances determining the outcome of fw that is why they excluded them if people cant abide by that and sidestep it the devs need to plug that hole somehow to protect the integrity of fw otherwise fw becomes pointless and dies if they dont just make fw corps immune from outside wardecs the less intrusive step would be to treat corps that wardec militia members just as if they were in the militia ie they would get attacked by the opposing navy in enemy highsec space and be war targets to everyone in that militia this would in effect be letting alliances into fw which the devs said they didnt want to do but it would at least be a step in the right directiondo you have a better solution
yep player corps faced with a wardec make a choice between a fight backb get helpc run away d surrender and stop asking for the eve wardec system to be broken in your favour because you have joined a pvp faction war and have gotten omg wardeccedwe dont need a solution because there isnt a problem
would the war mechanics be broken if my alliance could simply declare war on one corp of another alliance thus in return that alliance could not help out that one corpoh and lets not forget in fw you also get safe space and no npc navies wow
as you have been told about 1001 times in half as many threads fw militias are not alliances
come on i know you arent that dumbfleet battle between faction a 30 man fleet and faction b 30 man fleet here comes 10 ships from gr33f4lulz corporation who has sided with faction a and wardecced one of the 4 corporations in faction bs fleet so 6 of the ships in faction bs fleet are valid war targets for gr33f4lulz and the other 24 ships in the fleet cant even assist them without incurring a sec status hitfaction a wins gr33f4lulz well lulz and faction b says this is bull to hell with fwmind explaining to me how that isnt a bs abuse of the game mechanics that compromises the devs vision for fwyoure right there is no problem as long as you dont give a flying f at a rolling doughnut whether fw succeeds as a game mechanic or notfor someone who was elected to advocate for the good of the game you sure dont seem to be you know advocating for the good of the game
ok 50 man miltia fleet 1 poor sod in a war dec corp gets taken out while the rest of the fleet are helpless and cant help him that is wrong 
yea but the same mechanic would be wrong in one circumstance and not the other why is that fw militias are not alliances thats pretty much agreeable same as caldari is not gallente but yet they undergo the same mechanics i just dont understand why
its absolutely right if you are in the npc militia corp you have no right to fire without concord intervention on a player corp in empire outside the militia you are protected by the npc corp membership  price of that protection is impotence in the situation you describe if you consider that price is too high then join a player corp and do something about it
ok i understand that though player corps are directly war decing fw player corps to swing the tide of the war   it just seems to me that fw player corps are leaving because of this reason 
yep and thats entirely how its supposed to work both sides could hire mercenaries to strike at the other from the respective hisec as is happening and 3rd parties could involve themselves for whatever reasons they choose and of course since militias are not alliances any corporation or alliance could still have valid reason to target a corporation affiliated with a militia for personal reasons you cant alter that without breaking eve and making the militia a haven for wardec avoidance exploitthe answers to the fake problem discussed in the op are already on offer a fight backb get helpc run awayd surrender all the tools are already in place and militia affiliation should in nowise give additional protection against wardecs to individual corpsfw does have problems that weve already helped to point out but this isnt one of them
post constructively saint
ok jade i see what your getting at ive only been doing in 10 days or something lets see how it pans out
post constructively saint
nice to see somebody open to reasoned debate to be honest thanks for that as for the long term  i think fw will be fine but what needs to happen is the rollout of additional rewards for militia members corps and individuals that give them reason to be in the firing line for more than just medals some nice loyalty point stores special mods and ships and such basically a reason to fight if there is an incentive to stay in and handle adversity well see a better response to the challenge of the environment and more robust way of facing up to wardecs at the moment you have a weird situation where people can just skip to the npc militia for near complete protection and the corps do have problems against wardecs because a they dont want to fight b nobody will help them fight and c there isnt a fiscal motive for them remaining in the militia anyways this tends to lead to collapse and running away and dissolution in adversity and snowballs because the former members of defeated corps join other corps with a litany of defeatist carping and spread poor morale like a psychic plague i think the solution is make being a corp in the militia more profitable  make the missions and plexing more rewarding  make it something worth fighting to retain access too i think corp members in the militias should get more loyalty points than npc militia members since they are more vulnerable something like that give people a reason to fight and fight hard and the game benefits
ooo excuse me ill post constructivelythere is no reason for corporations to join the militias if doing so just puts them at a disadvantage in the part of the game that theyre trying to participate in why would they do so and be a valid war target for the entire opposing militia and be hindered in the opposing militias highsec space when they can simply wardec one corp in the opposing milita and be immune from boththis is clearly not the devs vision for fw their vision is being contravened by s few wiseguys in the game who think theyre brilliant and that everyone else including the devs arent what are the devs going to do about it
personal attacks are not permitted on the forums saint
just because you cannot see the reason doesnt mean there isnt one why are outbreak involved in the minmatar militia as a corp they dont seem to be having these problems why are dead parrots involved in the gallente miltiia as a corp they seem to be doing pretty well why are slackers involved in the amarrian militia as a corp  you get the idea corporations join militias for the benefits of being corporations corp hangerscorp assetswalletscorp channels and command and control and what they get for joining as a corp is access to the fw militia content medalsrewardswarroom etc and free wardecs vs the enemy militia and all associated corps their vulnerability is the ordinary vulnerability they have outside the militia association to empire wardecs it costs isk to wardec individual corps from outside the militia  that is the disadvantage of doing it that way eve is about choices and variety  there are many ways to prosecute a war and its your choice as to how you go about iti think you are overstating a personal issue that annoys you because you are from a corporation that probably cant handle the demands of faction warfare on the corp level its clearly not an issue for other corps outbreak parrots slackers and many many others so its wrong for you to state this false problem like a universal truth its also wrong for you to attempt to speak on behalf of other players motives  you dont understand them you have no neccessary insight so id ask you to avoid such speculations because they dont help the discussion or the general mood of constructive debate
if empire corps are looking for profit theyll keep running l4sthe reason corps join fw is to compete and win against other players not collect loyalty points as long as you have corps that can influence the outcome without subjecting themselves to the same ristrictions and risks as the milita corps there is no reason to join the militia it just gimps you its broken right or wrong
you are wrong mainly because you have no perspective or right to tell us why other corps join fw you dont know is the simple truth you know why your mains corp did i suspect but you simply cannot know why other players make that choice everyone does things for different reasons and generalizations like the one you use above doesnt help in slightest i sense you are frustrated most likely with the performance of your main characters corp in the fw setting which is probably why you choose to use an alt to continue this discussion to protect the mains identity and youre probably just passing on that frustration to this debate but its not really helping all thats evident is the frustration and not the logic or understanding of the situation
which rp alliance fights for the caldari which caldari corp did you mention above the only thing annoying me here is that youre playing me for stupid if you want to have a reasoned debate stop not relevant the stated intent of the devs was to exclude at least for now player alliances from determining the course of fw are you sidestepping that or notyou need to ask for a refund from whomever sold you that crystal ball i come from a corporation that doesnt give a damn about fw im advocating for the good of the game which you should be doing but are not
wtf uhhh yeah im sure they joined for the cool insignias you need to start making at least a little bit of sense here the entire proposition of fw was to fight for your faction it was never held out as a way to get rich and nobody in their right mind joined it with the idea of doing so except maybe a few ninja looters and piratesyoure doing that playing me for stupid thing again i dont appreciate it
i simply dont believe you im afraid i find your use of an alt speaks the direct opposite  my past experience of these forums teaches me that people use alts to troll and flame and stir trouble  never to advocate issues for the good of the game perhaps come back with your main and lets talk
i cant know you because you are hiding your identity behind a posting alt hence i cant judge your past commitment or posting record i cant know your ingame history i cant tell if you are serious or just trolling continually to derail threads you are pretty much the perfect illustration of why posting with alts is destroying debate on these forumsyou cant be insulted really because you dont have an identity here its just an act i wish youd post with a real character so people could judge you on past deeds and actions and your bias or lack therein could be seen as is its a bit pointless
im afraid your halfvast experience with the forums is leading you atray i have never posted with my main in 5 years i have always posted with various alts and i post on a wide range of subjects about the game just as passionately as im posting here go look at what i have to say about 00 sov for examplei dont post with my main because 13 year olds actual or intellectual have a difficult time distinguishing between talking about the game and playing the game i dont need to be n00bpwnzor11s in game enemy for life because he got butthurt over something i said on the forums
i have no idea why the militias cant get together and have a spokesman for the militia to present a clear proposalyou guys have been given great advice in the other threads to work together to defend each other has that happenedno why is a mystery everyone is so focused on what they perceive is broken rather than using the current mechanics to their own advantage i guess its easier to whine than actually figuring out how to make your situation bettereach militia has a website on that website you should be putting together a rep from each militia each rep should work with each rep in opposing militias from there you can make your voice heard rather than throwing  on the wall and seeing what sticksif you want the mechanics of an alliance you need to start acting like one because right now you are just acting like a bunch of corps and individuals that can come and go as you like with no worries or any large commitment kind of like a militia how about thathere we are and not one of the folks fighting for the fw has supported the op not one no thumb nothing that is because you have no communication with each other all we hearing is a bunch of individual alts flailing around with separate and individual point of views
ive posted with my main but if this was a true debate where discussions could only be left here and not carried into the game itself then id be more than happy if you are not taking my post or any alts post seriously then you really need to step out of your csm chair and figure things out for yourself theres absolutely no need for my main or anyone elses to have to post here to make you feel bettertruth is ive played over 5 years longer than you ive been through every patch every nerf ive done the pirate ive done the carebear ive done it all im trained in a wide variety of skills to do just about anything this game can offer ive been in several alliances ive been out in 00 ive ran pos ive fcd ive scouted ive done large fleets nano fleets pos warfare yada yada yada i may not be a popular name among eve but ive done probably far more than you have ever done period
and yet because you are posting with an alt why would anyone believe you your posting on this particular alt has been abrasive and rude youve been unwilling to see other peoples points and dogmatically stated the same old disproved theories with nothing but growing irritation to mark your participation in the topic you are pretty much soapboxing with nothing but your own voice and a couple of other alts to back you up are those yours as well who knows any which way its simply not very persuasive i think you have made a bad mistake to keep your identity hidden for five yours you should have been building a reputation that people could refer too when considering your points of view instead you currently dont have one id suggest you begin posting with your main now and begin the task of gaining the credibility you need to take the kind of positions you have been taking anyways its your choice end of the day
but again because you are hiding behind an alt identity why should anybody believe you i can put on a party mask and claim to be the king of siam but without the retinue and bank account sureties its just words see the problem you could be anyone  even the other alts in this thread so all your claims of experience and game knowledge are ultimately just beyond proof or recognition all ive see of you is this alt and all this alt has done is post illinformed opinions and boasted how good a troll you are that really doesnt convince people to take you seriously
arent you supposed to be representing the community rather than judging the community hell even i am an alt why dont you have a go at me
ill save that till your next election campaign but on topic if you feel that we should be taking alts seriously when they claim to have 5 years of experience in every aspect of the game and then post stuff showing they have no clear understanding of eve or the mechanics they are talking about then i disagree i reserve my right which is common to any other eve player to disregard their input as invalid and unhelpful  eve as single server game with persistent identity for characters gives us the ability to earn and stand on our reputations i dont respect people who are afraid of their reputations and choose to hide them behind alts and so yep i dont like or trust opinions hidden behind alt identities  sorry if this offends your sensibilities but there it is and yep  come next election i wont be voting for you for many reasons but up there amongst them is the fact that you are an alt and didnt have the guts to run with your main identity
i dont have to convince you who i am i dont have to appeal to you in any way you can believe me or not just like you could be a noob who bought a character online you could be samuel l jackson playing this game and id give two s to you i could expose my main and yet that still wouldnt prove anything to you cuz theres nothing i need to prove to you im sensing you personally feel lesser than me wishing i didnt actually go thru more than you in this game because then youd really have no valuetruth is youre just a vocal muppet leader ive done far more and have experienced far more than you ever have ive seen this game for everyone since day one ive dealt with the bad and admire the good but one thing i do know is where there is an obvious flaw that promotes abuse and gives advantages to those looking to exploit you my friend fall right into that categorynow if you want to get back on topic about fw id be more than happy to discuss it with you but if you still wish to continue to pop your chest thinking you know all then be my guest
i am with jade on this one if you do not like getting wardeced then y are you in factional warfare
run for election with your main then thats my advise lets see how you do  if you are so much better than me you should be able to win the chair position easily with regard to this thread its a defunct argument its gone round a couple of hundred times already with the same result no support anyways hope to see you on the ballot sheet in september i guess
you wouldnt know me if i was  and wouldnt that be the biggest ironic turnaround slap in the face best thing ever if you voted for me
i can assure you thats very unlikely 
im not asking anyone to believe me i have pointed out the salient points of the argument here most of which youve simply and conveniently chosen to ignore not only have you not disproven most of my arguments you havent even addressed them ill restate them for you so that you can have another opportunitythe devs explicity stated that they did not want existing player alliance participation in fw combat at this time you are sidestepping their intent by exploiting the game mechanics yes or noplayers who choose to participate in fw combat through wardecs rather than joining the militia enjoy two imbalanced advantages compared to corporations who join the militias and engage in fw as the devs intended they are immune from attack by most of the opposing faction and they can attack unhindered in enemy highsec space which was clearly not tne devs intent when they created fw mechanics yes or nocorps who choose to participate in fw through wardecs rather than as the devs intended can have a disporportionate influence on fw fleet fights because they are not valid war targets to part of the enemy fleet yes or noit is more advantageous for a corp or several corps who want to influence the direction of fw to war dec individual corps in the militias rather than taking on the militia and the faction navy yes or nogiven that there is every reason not to join the militia if you are a corporation and want to influence fw clearly not what the devs intendedmy assertion is that if you want to participate in fw you should be subject to the same mechanics as everyone else who is participating in fw you should not be able to expoit the game mechanics to your advantage and by doing so gain a disporportionate influence on the outcome you should not be exempt from the limitations and risks borne by corps that join the militia and participate as the devs intended do you agree with that or not i appreciate your feedback in my opinion if my points of view dont stand on their own they dont deserve any consideration and neither do yours fancy icon under your name notwithstandingfeel free to answer this post or not im just spelling out what i think for the benefit of those reading along im sure youll disagree which is fine
the disadvantages of being wardecced by a nonfw entity while you are in a fw faction can be countered by several existing mechanics 1 speak to other corps in your faction and counter wardec said group 2 have your faction mates blow them up in low sec the old fashioned way 3 hire mercs against them i dont see the caldari state or any other faction taking an interest in one groups political strife and making it its own not supported

i am j4m z and i support and condone this message
im a day late and a dollar short but for what its worth i wholeheartedly agreeand i sincerely hope ccp learns something about what is and is not acceptable when making changes to the game this smacks of the fng pulling a random decision out of his butt shield resist amp balancing anyone rather than the informed considered process i we hoped was in placemalachy

ooc i think this is pretty messed up i have not yet had a chance to view one of these beauties also from what i have read in my short time many thanks are due to the man behind chribba i salute you sir in aiding in my first real mmouic i do not find it just that concord has indiscriminately banned previously sanctioned nonmilitary based ships from high security space the issues of new capital ships was handled in a fine manner and certain ships where grand fathered out being allowed high sec for no reason at all concord has decided to lift the clause without going through the proper channels this shall not be toleratedovar doce

love it wheres my lvl5 agent to pwn in 00
in nullsec the role of agents ie providing npc content to shoot at for rewards are provided by a combination of belt rats and exploration sites including anomalies detectable via ship scanner those are easily lucrative enough without having missions besides missions are linked to the eve backstory and to the npc factions if there were agents in allianceowned space the payments they make would rightfully come from the alliances coffers which i think most people would consider pointless
this
let me address the role issue with a counterpoint look at npc controlled nullsec there are rats exploration sites and excellent npc agents and did i mention the officer spawn chancelucrative enough your point there is not validas far as backstory goes as i explained before the alliance owning the territory doesnt necessarily fund all of the endeavors of the agents the faction that the agent comes from has their own agenda look at the missions that are offerred by highsec agents now they offer encounters against every faction in the game
what about the guy who has friends in a big alliance and wants to play with them for example im pretty sure the goons are big on this  i remember seeing a newbie to do list that had step 1 set your clone for station step 2 selfdestruct your pod on it and im pretty sure it was theirs theyre a noobfriendly alliance heavily 00 based and there should be something for their new players to do besides pester their old players for charity its not like t1 frigates can tank or gank belt rats or do a complex that basically leaves them with light pvp duty and thats both intermittent and a terrible way to build capital and even if my specific example is wrong the situation is hardly inconceivable a cardinal sin committed by far too many games is preventing people from playing with their friends  people like doing it and you should make it easy for them making l1l2 agents possible in hard 00 seems like a good way of doing this thats not to say l3l4l5 agents are a bad idea but they need a different justification
1 whats keeping the alliance members from coming to high sec and working with their new recruit until hes able and ready to enter 00 space2 why doesnt the recruit take it upon themselves to get ready before setting out for lawless space like training salvaging for free from the business 10 step so they have a means of making isk then they have a purpose besides bullet magnet during fleet combat like cleanup afterwards3 eve is hard argh or so it goes whenever a carebear complains about something so why suddenly are we pandering to 00 pirates by providing them an honest days work while they pass the time between gate camps mission raiding and suicide ganks how about you want the organized regimented pay scale mission running then stay to the straight and narrow and play in high sec if you want to be your own man and live your own life away from the man then go play in 00 and quit yer btchin
1 so an old player should be forced to choose between his game friends and his newbie rl friends is what youre saying people have obligations  if youre the guy who does pos fueling or youre the main fc you cant just drop everything to go to highsec with your girlfriend 2 hey i just started this great new game i dont get to play it for a week but i have a characterno thats idiotic yes a newbie can mount a salvager in relatively short order or a warp disruptor or a handful of other useful modules but having an income source that requires somebody else donating what is often the most valuable portion of their income stream is no different than making them live off the more explicit kind of charity 3 pirates are people too and we already do provide them with something to do between gate camps  ratting missioning and ratting are so similar in effect that i cannot see why one would be acceptable and another would not also you need to refine your list of piratical activities somewhat  00 pirates dont do a whole lot of suicide ganking what with the lack of concord and all
i see you never used capital class ships
i too have lost ships to lag over the 2 years i have played for the first year and a half any ship i lost i would petition and i would have the ship back within a week regardless of weather it was lag or a disconnect now that the server is barely keeping up with the player load in a moderately busy system they are refusing to record the logs that are so desperately needed to return lag killed ships ccp has been doing nothing good over the last year their usefulness ended after trinity graphics are amazing now with the exception of the creation of the csm emperian age was a crap expansion that had no place in a game that cannot handle the server load they need to focus on upgradingreplacing their central server with one that has at least twice the processing powerdata storagewhatever it is short on they have made so many updates to the games core systems that im sure it is starting to look like spaghetti code if they cannot take the time to fix these core issues then i am afraid the game they worked so hard to develop is going to fall within the next 5 years recent features have been added to the game to proved mechanics similar to other mmos one of the things i enjoyed about eve is that it was different than most other games i have played the combat system made sense for the most part the graphics and physics worked well and most importantly i could play over a dialup connection the devs have been making changes that are not in the best interest of their players i think i speak for a good portion of the player base when i say stop fing around and listen to what we have to say the csm was a good idea if you can follow through and listen to what they bring forwardedit used a spell check am used to writing in firefox which has a built in check not netscape
ccp has never reimbursed for desyncs anyway the only thing you can do is try to do a quick relog if you do it fast enough your tank will stay active which may be impossible if the system is laggingquick relog start another eve client log off the second one properly right after cycling your tanking modules if you have any immediately log in hopefully get through the character select screen quickly and hope you are still alive considering you were dying for 4 minutes you had plenty of time to do this oh no you lost a ship in eve boo hoo pity you you can also try using a spell checker sorting through that mess you call words is worse than ccps petition system
i must respectfully disagree i have on numerous occasions received a replacement ship with the modules that were destroyed anything left in the wreck was unreturned however i would post the logs of these ships being returned but they were all over 8 months ago and were saved on an old computer
i dont mind loosing ships m8te i dont cry over it please go check our killboard and ull see im head of losses always go for outnumberd hard fights never cry even if its a loss to a t1 gooni as for spelling go be a teacher im dyslexic so withought a spell check option here its hard its not about a single ship its the fact over time i add up everything its a shed load of time they have done very litte to amend the pettion system when countless people loose ships unfairly not only that but my point is once u loose ur ship to a bug this was bug they dont have on record or so they tell me then u come back to make isk and now even that area is so laggy that u make  money as the servers cant handle that area warping out and loggin is an option but when u are scrambled as i was in the situation where i lost my last ship u cannot warp out im sure ud make a great misses doutfire though
you can easily use a spell checker in a browser like firefox or you can copy your text to an external application like textpadeve is unfair naturally so what you are saying is they should reimburse every loss related to lag in any way i would find this a waste of time for gms as there is already insurance and losing a ship is no big deal and people lose ships to lag all the time even though in a majority of the cases they would have lost their ship anyway even if there wasnt any lag and yes you can log out even if you cant warp away and log back in 10 seconds later and fix the desync you had that way
well i was seriously ed off and out of time at work in tea break making my first post so yee it will be scetchy at best  no i dont think ccp should remburse every ship loss esp if it is just lagg but they can work on the petion system they can work on making it work better around lag insurance right well once u get away from t1 stuff u get nothing back esp with rigs faction stuff for sure if my last loss was the same as normal in a mission like a t1 bs then id be way less ed but in the situation i was in the game left me only one option that option is not possible with lagg my petioner responder agreas with me on this his sugestion was to move system ok then so the game cant handle even this now if i die to lagg in 00 pvp i hardly grumble alough when u fly a gista faction web inty with pollys allot forward scoute hence also losses galore and one slip of the mouse  tiny bit of lag or even recently bug where i could not see my mods where ready to fire not flashing but agressed when i locked someone  infront of centries they dont have this bug at all aparently i do wince p my alt just lost 4 t1 stabbers in a row  no it doesnt hurt even if it was all to lag im talking 380 odd hours worth of my time lost to buglag and simply bad game design when they developers know fully well how they have desgined rulesmissions now im really tierd p so ill probelry have to answer ur next post morow but u treat me like a noob again ill have to dig out all the goonie kills the me v 17 of u fights
if you purposely put yourself into laggy situations knowing that it will lag then really you cant blame them can youcase in point missions you said you lost ships in level 4 missions get the  out of motsu
while i hardly think its world ending to lose ships to lagoh well just more time in eve to get a new onei do fervently hope the powers that be would please do more to upgrade the server yes give us awesome newness you did now how about some peace of mindlike not dying just cus i jumped into a mega lag system filled to the brim with reds who are exploiting that same laghehehe now dying cus they all primary mehey thats life and kinda kewl in a ed i shouldnt have done that waybut not because of lag
not in motsu but its nice to hear at least for my point there are other systems like this my point is not one loss many in each case there are things u can do to improve the situationill go over one of them lev 4s  know u must understand ccp know a large amount of people will be suffering this lagg in allot of lev4 missions every turning hour of eve they design the missions so u have to control ur drones in reel time if u cant it changes the way u have to aproach ur missions one simple change to the way that works and sudenly 6000 players dont have that issue i dont blame them there is lagg but i blame that they know there is bad lagg and do very little towards rembursemnt when the rulesleves are not desgined to combat it if they spent as much time as they do advertising and bringing in more people who make the situation worse to addressing some really simple things it would help loads the game no longer functions in almost every asspect  posses large fleet fights fw with centry fire on little ships with lagg and finally ur way of making ur isk to go do all the rest id like a cry o meter for the amount of people at any given time finding lagg in all of the above itll be on lev 10 out of 10 for a good portion of the players i dont know i was never a programmer if there is anyway when u die a screne shot could be sent as well as a logg this would most likly add more lagg though to ccp so they can see an untamperd image of what was going down its taken 5 years of crappy buggs and now finally my last way of keeping all the other lagbug related losses in check also destroyed to make me say no i dont think u deserve another euro to a game i have much admired the last loss when i was pettioning i knew with the policy they would not remburse but i did get the gm to addmit the game is now floored for lev4 when u add lagg  his sugestion was same as urs  dont try and play in that sytem and move to another soon it will be just dont play if all they do is add more people if i spent as much as i have put into this game be it time and euors into a reel life product ie a car and it was brokencould not function id get my money back i cant do that with ccp and imginary ships but i can say enough is enough and no i wont put up with it id much rather help them make the game better but when u tell them of a new bug they a dont remburse u since its not on there list and b dont even bother to follow it up to see if there is a new issue to deel with raghh raghh cuts down rat
sad day a great loss to evemyself i dont fly anyting i cant stomach losing unfairly
unfortunately that appears to be my downfall or im just getting too old not sure if ur taking the micky out of me for sad day a great loss p but i know i will miss my friends and all those who blew me up or i ate corpses of eddit unlucky pill there we go can retier in stlye i have to say i still rate this as the best game ive ever played sure there our many others that come close but they have done allot of things so very well it has come so far from my first 00 jump where m0o where doing the dirty and u dint even see what happened was still worth it to say ud jumped in  second time round some hour later i did manage to see myself die and that was the start of a hunger for killing things seeing for a few seconds my own frozen corpse and wishing there was some sauce about i went way over the top with getting angry earlier but it means allot to me for a game and if it wasnt for the numbers vs connection problem then would have 100 x better game everyone can see that i do think they misgudge what was in my view the drive behind the initail game its hard i see it first hand in other mediums when u do well and make a name and expand so fast something of the core team is saturated i really try not to complain about much as i like allot they have done perhaps if one of my fellow corpies can take over the solo kills ill get twitchy in the paws  or i could just be egging them on since well no more fw for me till account is closed where is that sabre my last honest piece of advice to u is  if an admiral in your alliance ses he board with politics and is going to start a really dedicated pirate corp and ses things like get him my prittes with a plan to back it up do not miss the chance i wish u all good hunting and if ur not hunting yet but want to listen to somthing that gets u in the mood just type preditor rap into goolge video and ull get the picture eddit for all of my ankle byting thrests ccp  sry it really wont happen i do thank u for the good times i wish all the best at find ninja ways of turning this game into what it so deserves to be ps sorry i ate the hamsters it was me

hey look its me supporting a ui thread seriously though this one looks much better than most  only xaens has approached this level of completeness that ive seen
they do have a whole team dedicated to overhaul the ui as far as i know so its not like ccp has forgottenthat said the current situation is not as we would like it to be so it would be good to get some more details on what ccp has planned for us in this aspect
very good list this needs to be top of csm pile
greetings im author one of of that list of usability issuesi planned to post topic here in assembly hall about it and found this theme that list is intended to be help tool for ui team of ccp  so that they can concentrate on improving ui and not searching for problemsin linked theme people are writing their support for list in form of signed messages  so if you want to estimate what support our idea have please proceed to that topic
a nice list this isccp look at they must
signed
long overduealso make the ui multithreaded so we dont freeze when opening the stupid market window
id say not multithreaded but asynchronous because literal multithreading is not possible in common game application due to perfomance and synchronization issues
pdf takes too long to load on a deployed military ship so im just going to support this out of the general idea that it calls for a look into improving the ui
putting all the whines and biased opinions aside fw is a new game mechanic and some issues have arose and need to be reexamined im posting as many that i can think of not all i agree with or deem an issue but i believe they need to be looked atplease support for the simple fact that all these issues in fw need to be looked at again under the microscope1 the effects of two wars with two separate rules of play a militia not being able to defend their own militia counterparts b safe space being given to those outside fw deccing militia corps c npc navies ignoring corps outside fw deccing militia corps2 neutrals nonfw players having battle impacts a lootings b reppingboosting chosen parties c helping in hisec d security losses when engaging neuts involved in fw3 spies4 lack of worthy rewards for time and efforts a defenseoffense plexing having little effect b no advantageous gains to persons or corps gaining victory points5 alliances and corps in alliances participating or staying out6 idea that continued abuse of fw mechanics will lead to its demise and ruin the impact of what fw initially set out to be7 no clear objectives no path to victory no end in sight for fw players looking to change the outcome when does anyone win8 npc navies need a boost9 npc in your faction attacking you if you enter an enemy mission ie gallente navy npc attacking you if you enter a caldari mission against gallente it dont happen in complex
no support fw is not a pvp instance and never should be it should definitely continue being open to influence from the rest of eve
influence yes influence with several clear advantages no you can add to the listnpc in your faction attacking you if you enter an enemy mission ie gallente navy npc attacking you if you enter a caldari mission against gallente it dont happen in complex
okay so you find nothing even remotely worthy to look at in the above list what if this thread gets 200 supports that fw simply needs to be looked at again thats the only real issue im proposing and yet you think its perfect already damn your personal opinion is what this thread is trying to avoid sorry you already see it that way but i think its your job to listen to what people have to say right
we discussed 4 separate issues pertaining to faction warfare and provided the fw development team with a whole lot of direct feedback from the players involved with fw a month or so ago your list is mainly involved with arguing against external influence on fw by promoting it as a pvp instance and as such no i dont find it at all useful or support worthy and i wont be supporting it and for the record ive listened to pretty much everything the proinstancing lobby have argued for and reached an informed position in disagreeing with you completelyfw is not perfect and we have proposed many and significant changes already but the things you are complaining about are not problemsnote the only thing in your post that has merit is and weve already said as much to the fw dev team in the direct consultation documents we submitted they know
please explain to me what you think pvp instance means im not against external forces involving in fw but i am against clear advantages of external forces using and abusing what they do because of the existence of fw
where the heck do you get that i was complaining about problems and quite frankly im appalled that you can sit here and assume you know what i think is right and wrong with fw i personally think you have your own idea and should keep that to yourself and explore the ideas of others thus promoting your jobon another note please link me to your public records of the councils discussions on fw issues all the issues that have been listed should be discussed if you havent then you are pushing for your own eve
the clue was in the op post if its not supposed to be an issue thread then fine ill ignore it but i suggest its best moved to somewhere else jita park maybe
all im proposing is that faction warfare has issues and all of them need to have a clear discussion and a clear response from what ccp sees and believes should be reviewed and focused on to eventually be fixed
lol jade yes youre not biased ok a closer examiantion of the op1 needs to be looked at does not make sense at all if you wardec one corp within the militia you should fight them all2 nonissue live with it3 same is an issue for almost every alliance out there4 should be looked if we want fw to have continuity pew pew for the sake of it wont last long objetives  real impact  probably rewards are needed5 not sure which the issue is6 should be discussed7 read 48 maybe should be discussed9 obviousso yes fw some of this stuff needs examination i support the op
if you havent figured it out yet the csm reps have two priorities when pushing to have things worked on1 their personal agendas concerning things that help them as an individual not a corp or alliance member get more for themselves out of eve2 the agendas for their groups playstyle at the expense of everyone elsesoh yeah10 listening to the concerns and issues of the eve userbase and bring those to the attention of ccp to have the situations examined for improvmentson that notefw has some fatal flaws and needs immediate attention most especially those damn nuub neutrals
while ccp should improve comunication overall i think a lot of the confussion comes from not knowing whats being done with the game and where are we headinga lot of this concerns could be easilly fixed writing more devblogs and answers in the forums but oficially updating the patch notes section including all the subsections in testing in development etc would also help a lotjust that
i endorse this post btw
agreed  more communication with the player base especially about game changes is good the lowsec capital thing didnt bug me so much as the fact that we found out about it after the fact
thats for darn surethe in testing and in development sections havent been touched in over a year which is idiotic
ccp really needs to learn how to communicate with its player base the dev blogs game news and pre patch notes are not enough we should be able to look at the following1  what are they are working on2  what is the progress on the current projects3  what is the estimated time of implementation
my number one issuewe dont know how bad anything else is until we know what else is on the horizon
doh
edit dont reply
something needs to change but i dont honestly feel this is the right solution i share all the ops frustrations about the lack of skill and the relative meaninglessness of the trainable skills probingscanning is the suck right now and could really use an overhaul
ok here is something in between current system and ops ideaan option to transfer directional scanner info angle and rangeeven shiptype to the probe so you tell the probe where to look ofc the less space the probe has to scan the faster you get a resultwith this system there would be only one type of probe directional probe or whateverie your target is 2au from a planet and you manage to guess the distance and got it at 15 degree angle then you run the probe and in less than 30 secs you have the resultsounds reasonable
i think this would really only work against a mission runner or explorer who has to stay in one spot for a while to do what theyre doing any smart combat target is going to warp around and completely defeat this systemprobe should work like a radar or sonar screen every ping going out would light up its area of effect for you and show you blips within it the strength of the blip should be effected by the sig radius of the object and whether its moving or notthe operator skill would come in trying to figure out whether what they were looking at was a ship a piece of space junk or an rock in space safe spots would no longer be safe youll stand out like a sore thumb better to hide near an encounter a bunch of abandoned drones an old inactive pos or something else in space that could confuse the guy who is looking for you
damps do not have the range that falcons do falcons would be the primary target for a damp based ship hence no role there any damp ship at fleet ranges which i am assuming is 125km  since you gave no amplification would be popped quickly since its ewar range is well within sniper range no role there either your statement lacks merit
this seems like the sort of idea that is best implemented with an overhaul of station containers not an explicit division system i agree in principle but i think this is the wrong means to your end
it would be a case of either or of coursei wouldnt mind which either as long as the station vaultswarehouses could be accessed remotely and contents manipulated as if they were in on a hangar floor
thats pretty much what i meant by an overhaul  make containers available in secure and insecure varieties bothsame sizes but insecure being cheaper and make them accessible remotely for contracting and the like its how they should work and itd eliminate the need for divisions
alright so when you buy something or when you have something lying aboutyou can either open the fitting screen and drag the item into the proper slotor you can click the item itself and simply say fit to active shiphowever why dont items come online if you use the second option why do i have to choose that option and then open the fitting screen to bring them onlinesome people say open the fitting screen and then select the option which is no better than dragndrop to begin withpoint being why have the option on the menu if its so freakin useless
huh wierd they always come online for me when i use the fit to active ship selection sometimes on really laggy days it takes some time but it still happens
if this is the case it needs to be fixed
actually if you open the fitting screen first then right click  fit to active ship it fits it and onlines it it is only if you do not have the fitting window open that it does not online it for you i dont know if this is a glitch or serves a purpose
thats actually exactly what hes complaining about
preciselyif i have to open the fitting screen and then select the item i may as well just drag and drop the item while im at itif i simply want to select an item from the hanger or maybe even several items ctrl click and fit to active ship why do i then have to open fitting and turn them all on
i do have this probelm as well though not all the time i will admitit can get irritating when your in a rush to join a fleet that is going to ditch you in 1 minute your like finally i can get out of here you undock and see none of your modules active
not the place for reporting glitches but still an annoying issue i think the problem is the database trying to keep up with all the players changing their ships at once it is bound to skip a line of code every now and then sometimes i even have to manually online mods i drag and drop
this actually remembers me of an idea that i used to have when there was that bookmarkinsta problemand well it was about exactly that would be fun if they read my idea and tested it hehehealtough probaly not but still it would be fun
this is just one of the old redundant skills from before wt0 ccp should remove to avoid unwanted behaviorits just plain wrong experimental codeconfiguration gets released in production
its far from redundant if you read the skill description its not restricted from use on items other than gates
yeah but neither is wtz
i agree with you but what i read from the skill is that it would allow you to decrease the distance from the object to which you are warpingas it is if you warp to zero on a gate youre immediately within range to warp out only really susceptible to smartbombs if you warp to zero on a jetcan youre not within range to open it and need to either approach or orbit at 500 to do sowhat im asking for is to allow the skill so that we can lessen the gap and improve the abilities of the skilled pilot
my assumption has always been that wtz put you as close to the object as the game engine would allow if its possible to get closer than the current 2500m then id think it should be put into wtz and not require a skill at all i agree warping to a can and then having to fly to it is annoying but this seems like a problem that should have a direct fix not a skill
this is just something i was thinking of i am not saying they should hurry up and rush out tech iii anything modular fittingsnow wouldnt it be nifty if you could have some modular bays on your ship you could change while in flight maybe i should explain this a little further i think it when they eventually come out with tech iii ships if they were equipped with what i call modular fittings rather than giving them more fitting slots or more resists what these fittings would do is allow you to load a fitting with two modules and switch them at certain times this could require that the module be off lined first or maybe just make it require the 95 cap and let you switch all modules at once at a 90 cap penalty lets take a tech 3 coercer for an example lets say 4 of the 8 high slots are modular along with one modular mid and two modular lows you could fit the 8 highs with lasers and the 4 unused modular slots with salvagers you could fit the modular mid with an ab and a mwd and the modular lows with heat sinks and overdrives so after you get done blowing up whatever it is you like to shoot you could let your cap build up and switch to salvage mode which would switch 4 of the lasers for salvagers switch the ab for the mwd and the heat sinks for the overdrives obviously there would be issues on this and a lot of balancing but it seems like a neat idea to me any thoughts would be welcome
im not convinced tech 3 is a good idea but if they do it this would certainly be an interesting way of going about it that said this is not a petition and as such it should not be in the assembly hall this belongs in features  ideas
sorry i thought this was the right place to post ideas if a mod would move this for me i would be grateful
assembly hall is for ideas you want the csm to bring up and ccp to implement thats a pretty open category but there are limits this thread seems like more of a wouldnt it be cool if they did x at some point in the future which is too nonspecific for this board imo your mileage may vary but thats my two cents ive reported your post so hopefully a gm will see it and move it shortly
moved to features  ideas
my thanks to both of you now that this is in the right forum does anyone have any thoughts or anything to add to this idea
as for the actual merits of the idea im just trying to think of how i would use it the most obvious starting point is ships with two fits i fit my hauler with a capacity fit and a speedagility fit and use my cargo hold and a station for modularity having the option to switch back and forth would be a convenience but nothing special similarly a lot of missions exist where youd love to be able to jump back and forth between railguns and blasters or switch out a hardener it would be a huge huge convenience to be able to do this and would probably speed up the killing phase of missioning at least 20 for most ships in pvp the options get even stranger  dumping your sensor boosters for tackling gear once youve got a lock dumping your damage mods for stabs if things go pearshapeddepending on how its implemented swapping out the damage fit for a logistics fit putting a salvager in slot 9 for once the fighting is over swapping your mwd for a ab if hit by a scram post nano nerf and so on in order for this to work i think you need two stipulations firstly a modular slot uses the higher fitting value of its installed items  if you have a cloak for 60 cpu and a gun for 4000 pg the modular slot will use 4000 pg and 60 cpu this is to prevent illegal fits from happening in midflight secondly any penalties for having a module activecloak stab mwd have to be applied even if theyre the alternate module in a modular slot of course you could still offline them but then youd have to both swap and online to get them to usability i really dont know what id do with these after a bit more consideration  itd depend a lot on the ships that flew them the costs for swapping and just how much of an evil genius i could make myself but im quite sure itd be fun to see what people did with this
ive posted a similar suggestion  sadly i should have searched but on these forums mehanyway read the thread see what you thinkpersonal hangar division thread
yes i would see this mod be possible on this ship class also as ccp quote black ops supposed to be valuable for their role logistics and tactical flexibility  not as straight combat 1v1 ships etc see them more as logistic then 1 vs 1 pvp this cov ops cloak would fit in perfectly
i would be willing to throw out every other idea if it could only use the covert ops cloakmeh
agreedsorry
supported for many reasons1 fw is supposed to be a stepping stone towards 00 operations for people fresh to pvp keeping the alliances out doesnt make sense given that this is the goal what you want is joint fleets with alliance members and nonalliance members so that the alliances can see first hand whether a pilot or corporation is skilled enough to join them player skill wise not skill points wise2 the stated rp reason for the empires keeping the alliances out of fw doesnt make sense either do you really think that for example the amaar empire would say no to a large group of veteran pilots cva who turn up and say we want to fight to help protect your interests simply because they happen to be in a 00 alliance from a purely rp perspective it would be like them turning round and saying that the ammatar mandate cant fight alongside them
this message is more to the csm than it is to the players but everyone should have a say in this soo   problem the csm forums is becoming cluttered with requests for ship modifications and the csm is stuck choosing which modifications to bring forward almost all the ships are represented here in some way shape or form either by name or class reccomendation a merge simmiler modification requests ie ship a pg increse request goes with ship b pg increase this will alow more ships to be brought before ccp and then allow ccp to determin the exact ships and by what amounts their attributes should be shiftedreccomendation bmerge modification requests by ship class or by ship role ie all cruiser requests or all t2 ew class requests this will alow more ships to be brought before ccp and then allow ccp to determin the exact ships and by what amounts their attributes should be shiftedreccomendation cslit the current assembly hall into sub topics ie ship reccomendations weapon recomendations pvp mining etc this will clean up the csm forums and allow players to argue their cases without geting hidden under other ideaswhile looking over the forums i have seen several good ideas get pushed away by constant arguing over ships and weapons all i am requesting is a condensing of one of the most popular topics on the forums i want to see the gameplay ideas stuff that really affects me if implimented not arguments over ships i cant fly let alone will probably never flyps if you dont like my idea or think it is stupid please feel free to let it fall by the wayside like so many others have done i will not bring this topic up again like the few who cant realize that they are the only ones who think about whatever they are posting
i have a similar thought only that i dont really think that the csm should take a heavy position on ship balancing due to well the heavy prevelance of whining
what the op describes is real but itUFFFDs up to the reasonable players to deal with people with bad habits in the game
but the word nanos seems to be history
i support your goal of making the game more fun for newcomers the game is boring at the beginning however newb only zones might not be the best method i think the problem is not that newbs cant compete eventually they can when they finally understand some of the complexities of eve it is just that there is not a whole lot of satisfaction when starting the game
i frankly agreeand it certainly seemed to speed up the process that the csm did something
re capitals from high secinteresting that you think this action by ccp affected many players on eve perspective is what is required in such circumstancesfor instance your outcry is actually400245000 x 100  016 of playersid say that a response by ccp within the day of the change shows that they both watch the forums and take note of player responses above that they can admit when errors have been made im not sure how you think the csm could have dealt with this situation the time between meetings and ccp  csm interaction is designed imo to stop just such over reactions taking up too much csm timetake carearithron
the thing is 245000 is the wrong number to be using what is the biggest number of unique respondents on any thread in the history of the eve forums lets say 5000 for the assembly hall its 2500 or sothe vote threads about the nano nerf if you pair them together 400 is 8 of the forums baseline and 16 of the assembly hall baseline and thats in the first few hours assuming the eve forum community is representative of the eve community as a whole that means that a huge proportion of the community thought this decision was a bad one as soon as they heard about it its like the old maxim in customer service  if you get one letter that means 40500 depending on who you ask people feel the same way but were too lazy to tell you look at the size of the thread proportional to the size of the forums  most of the user base wouldnt post if they made subscription fees 1000 a month and sent a man around to your house to kick you in the balls
and im glad that they did it does help restore faith in the fact that ccp are listening to what we have to say they may not agree with what we say but at least theyre listeningadmittedly the reaction on the forums did get very ott with the threads going from a calm can we have an official response as to why the changes were taking place to a bipartisan give him back the veldnaught or our eleventy million accounts will be quitting  tough cookies chribba in truth i didnt care whether the caps were moved back or not i supported this issue on the principle that i wanted an answer from ccp as to why they had been moved in the first placeand to put your figures into context it was 400 supports in 12 hours when gm grimmi posted the clarification currently 500 in 24 hours because people havent gotten the message that the issue is resolved though there are side issues which still niggle like rule 3 the only threads larger in the assembly hall were the two nano vote threads if my memory is right with 1500 supports in the antinerf thread in 32 daysif the issue hadnt been resolved when it was youd likely have seen a steady rise in the amount of support that the issue gained so by the 32 day mark youd be looking at approximately 12000 support votes if the rate of supporting posts stayed steady it likely wouldnt have youd be more likely to see a logartyhmic decrease in the number of new supports per dayhowever arguements concerning statistics aside as the old saying goes you can make statistics say whatever you want them to say hopefully this incident will lead to the positive step of more ccp interaction with the general playerbase if only to tell us that were on completely the wrong track with our speculationsand on that note hopefully we can get this thread back to its original purpose which was to figure out how to improve the functionality of the csm im of the belief that a certain amount of leeway must be allowable within the csm process otherwise the process just gets bogged down with red tape and arguements about procedures you on the other hand appear to believe that certain rules are unbendable example the 7 day rule i doubt that well ever agree on this particular point so perhaps its better if we both step back from it and look at other ways that the csm can be improved instead
stats can certainly be changed to support any viewmy point was that even if there were 400 unique users posting on that thread it still represented a very small part of the eve playerbase i take the point that not all players use the forums however i cant agree that just 5000 from 245000 use them by not posting in a forum because they dont caredont agree players are overlooked in circumstances such as the cap ship affairmy opinion of the guidelines and rules that the csm should act within are not for the sake of being anal nor to create redtape its really that a council which is continuous through time needs to act within some rules in order for there to be consistency for the playerbase and some sense of awareness of whenhowwhy the csm does what it does eg issue adoptionthe purpose of the 7day rule is simple issues need to be brought to the attention of the playerbase discussed although this currently is what maybe doesnt happen that much and then brought to the csm if supported by ignoring this fundamental rule which gives the playerbase an opportunity to express their views the door is opened for numerous issues to be brought to the table in a csm meeting without adequate discussion nor player input whos to say that one alliance wont get a majority onto the csm at some future pointim of the opinion that many of the guidelines setout in the csm documents were to ensure consistency fairness and a sense of control to the playerbase afterall the csm is their tool for getting issues brought to the attention of ccp currently issues which dont affect the majority of eve players in some cases a very small minority seem to get more attention than others tweaks and bugs take up their fair amount of time too issues are rarely discussed by some csm members on the forums or between csm members on channelsmailing lists etcrules ensure smooth operation of a council everyone knows where they stand change the rules to suit the situation and before long you get mistrust and a loss of credibilitywhich may be starting to sound familiartake carearithron
hear hearwait whatd you call me
i think the mechanics are fine as they are salvaging and looting are trivial activities and people that want to make these things their endgame are totally cool to do so they will condemn themselves to flying subpar ships and will probably never leave the few level 4 mission hubs eve has got i have no problem with thati cant help but smile when i see a guy from 20062007 in a t1 frig decloaking for the 25m worth of lootsalvage i leave on my level 4 grindsbut then again i usually dont lootsalvage myself as i dont think the gain is worth the effort when compared to bounties i can run another level 4 room in the same time it takes me to salvage one so if a ninja hotshot in a t1 frig wants to clean up the mess i leave behind be my guest
ill have to mention that to some of our hac pilots im sure theyre happy to hear about their sub par ships ninja salvagers to play against people while mission runners like to play with themselves ie npc drones do you seriously think that were only looking for your salvage you should read morekey word grindsask any see any ninja salvager how much hisher work is a grind and youll find the same response we live to salvage carebear tears from those mission runners who like to run off at the mouthand from those who think theyre so far above everybody else that they post on the forums about how it doesnt bother themdont act so high and mighty if youre running missions youre playing eve offline
yeahsigned when a t2 item is signifigantly worse than its base t1 counterpart much less the faction equivalents then something is terribly out of whackcurrently only ham rage can go further than its t1 counterpart all others go about half the range why in eve do javelinprecisions go only 12 as far as a t1 base version thats just stupidexplosion velocities need to be double the missiles flight velocity ie a 5kms missile should have a 10kms detonation this will enable the few missiles that can hit nanophags to actually scratch their paint if not much more than thatalsofof missiles and defenders are terribly flawed in so very many waysdefenders need to function across a fleet spread allowing for the use of dedicated missile screening ships and larger missiles need to be tougher requiring more defenders to destroy citedels cruise ectfof since they spread their fire around need to do 2550 more damage than their t1 counterparts move considerably faster and have very largeswift explosion radii they also need descrimination much as drones have now to focus on large cruisers bs larger medium dessies frigates fighters and small drones via a dropdown on the stack in cargo making that the default behavior for the entire stack until changed

if i understand correctly the reason it is not already in place is that someone given the roles to do so could really mess up your orders that being said i would hope anyone who has been given the power to make a buy or sell order on behalf of the corp is trusted in the first placetrust  no need for the current rulei would be fine with allowing my corp mates to change some of my orders and that would be something we would work out between ourselves
i love this idea as pointed out it will be a great thing for trading corporations and encourages working together as a groupsupported
i suppose that was probably the reason but anyone who has the power to make corp orders can screw you up badly already who doesnt want to buy tritanium at 100 per unit if you want security have an limit on how much money each player with roles can play withsettable permember by the ceo but dont impede usability for a fairly small benefit to security

and this is relevant to me howfor me to make that much iskhr i would need to spend a significant amount of time grinding a substantial sum of isk for a factionfit gankme ship in addition to running a second account to loot and salvage what is the point of that the game then starts sounding more like a jobfor that i already have rli run missions because sometimes i enjoy running them hell usually i dont even loot my missions some days i run l4s in a bs or l3s in a bc other days i run l1s and l2s in my frigates andor cruisers some days i take my mining ship and just float around in a belt for a whilethe money i make from these activities even allows me to get blownup from time to time imagine that
you dont need a faction fitted ship t2 fitted marauader will do just fine crystal sets also make missions much easier but do not make you any more lucrative to suicide gankersand youre not really countering my point which is the people that do grind l4s in highsec make far too much isk
people that grind anything make alot of isk your point is irrelevantdo you believe that moons should become depleted after a short period due to intensive exploitation
yes please would be great
tired old argument thats so cute i will try not to make the mistake of cluttering the issue with facts any morebut it must be clear even to you that because those 80 dont play the way you want is no reason to change their game enjoyment
way to miss the point bison those 80 might or might not be playing the game malcanis wants thats not the point the point is that none of us know how those 80 wants to play the game so they are a non factor and the argument is moot i dont suppose that would ever enter your thick rosecolored skull though
rosecolored skull good one max lolbut seriously i do not think that because we may not know how that 80 wants to play makes them a nonfactor or the argument moot i say this because it would appear that a vocal minority who post fervently in the forums would like to change how those other 80 want to play for no other benifit than their ownmaybe that begins to explain my point better 
i say that the reason those 80 are in high sec is because high sec pays too damn much isk with too little effort thats one way of using that statistic and its pretty friggin hard to disprove not to say impossible get the point
sure i think i get your point you dont like them playing the game the way they choose because you think its too easy personally i make much more isk being in 00 than i ever did in empire more risk sure  but more reward
sigh no you obviously dont get my point im going to leave it at that as you obviously have trouble understanding easy arguments
more flesh more thread maturitythe tankactive tanks dont exactly scale well barring nighthawks etc most ships cant do much more than active tank solo against another ship or two at their tier many ships cant even do that the move to cut off the damage curves of the largest damage dealers is probably the right one to get the required tank and ehp into sane limitsafter looking at a lot of damage curves against simulated versions of the ship basically dictors with a mwd and turning the speed down it looks like pure speed tanking wont quite be enough this might be the right class to implement the active stealth module ccp toyed around with in the past dropping the sig down to a bc size of 300m drastically changes damage curves vs sniper bss and rules out an alphapop for all but the best of situationsfor missile users the stellar ab performance wont be reducing damage very much so a sig radius decrease will hit antibs weaponry in a manner more in line with what turrets will experiencefurthermore since the fleet command links would require the ship to be staying in formation if it has to go too fast to reduce bs exposure its just going to leave its own formation behind sig radius decreases can get the desired values in line with whats needed for formation fightingwhere is the right level looking at an awesome marauder setup the tank really isnt stellar once you start thinking of focus fire even with a sigreduction possibility and factoring in for implants boosters gang boosters and command mods the solo tanking wont really be all that stellar against another gang however as combat scales up logistics used to support the ship can also scale up so the sweet spot need not be set in the jovian realmin all cases the ship isnt supposed to be invincible and the act of reducing incoming damage by 80 and possibly having logistics backup means the amount of hardware effectively tanked during that period will be astronomical for one shipformation command linksdoesnt take a great deal of imagination to come up with new links for each race that match that races particular combat style throwing out some new concepts for links that might also be able to find a niche setting where they come in handy would also contribute to each racial ships individuality wont comment on which race needs whatunited frontships coordinate formation to minimize frontal area and reduce damage taken uses fleet marshal heading and dotproduct with turretmissile terminal vector to come up with a damage increasedecrease running away is very bad only effective when flying into the enemybroadside fire controlincreases damagetrackingrof when target location is perpendicular to your ship all turrets on one side can track the target and youre parallel to the fleet marshal only effective when flying tangential to enemyinterception maneuversincrease to warp disruptorscram range in the direction the fleet is heading for chasing things down or getting points at range during onset of combat gotta fly towards themencircling attackattack from behind bonus to damage for shooting them in the ass d also known as the nambla maneuver entirely appropriate for the amarr navysure its possible to come up with many many more and then weed out the broken ones  a word on calculations all of these calcs can be represented with vector dotproducts operations that are fairly simple the values can be represented as an invisible stat of a ship all ships have instantaneous headings and if they have a fleet marshal may have modifiers that are derived from those vectorstwo flavorsfurther differentiate the starfleet and squadron hulls by the number of mods that can be fitted think of command ships
not supporting because you called rp rubbish
intended meaning was that my rough draft of the underlying story material was wholly inappropriate and that it would not suffice for those in the player base with more refined tastes in rpis that some good pr bs im practicing to run for president
i have been thinking of an interesting addition to our flight experience in eve the idea is that you can carry a fellow podpilot as a passengerwhybusiness opportunity bodyguard  i want a taxi ride perhaps through hostile territory and will pay an individual to deliver me safely perhaps for the duration of the journey the pilot also adopts my war decsbusiness opportunity copilot  i could pay for a passengers help on long haul flights the ap could be set as i tend to other matters  the passenger is paid for his services in operating the mwd at gate approaches to speed up the journeytraining support what better way to help players learn than for them to sit in the cockpit and see how a more experienced pilot operates  seeing tactics timing and use of modules etc i could join a large 00 fleet and see the capital ships in action first hand regardless of my current skill setfuture expansion this idea could eventually be expanded so that the passenger can become actively involved in the performance of the ship a bit like a pos gunner this could mean the ability to take control of drones  with the pilots permission or use tractor beam and salvager while the pilot deals with the mission npcs
genius
yea why not  sounds nice
i love the idea of training could be an excellent tool for every facet of eve
easiest thing for them to do will be to abandon fw and pretend like it doesnt exist and they will if ccp isnt going to support it no reason they should eithermy prediction though is that its going to backfire on the wiseguys if ccp doesnt fix it as soon as pirate corps and goon alts catch onto how easy it is to grief fw fleets with this little tactic the real fun will start and you may see the very same people who are supporting it now crying for their mommy
if they drop out then they were never really dedicated to the cause anyway if they cant organize themselves enough to combat a common foe thats their problem if you dont think pirates and other assorted bad people havent noticed then you are mistaken generally fw people are not worth their time t1 ships and fittings have a poor profit margin if you need ccp to help shield you by changing game mechanics because you cannot organize a defense perhaps hello kitty online is more your cup of tea
the irony is of course that its mostly goonalts currently complaining about being wardecced in caldari militia corps in all these threads but then i imagine you already knew that didnt you
getting tiresome yes im an alt toojust play the damn game people
speaking as someone who joined the fw as an individual and not as part of a player corpi can truly say i did it because it was cooluntil i saw the lengths of which people will go to exploit the mechanicsit cant be helpedeven amongst well respected corps i have flown with in the pasti saw all sorts of exploitationpurposefull exploits of lag outside war decking you name itbut i saw it from the perspective everyone seems to be overlookingthe individual playerbtw that character has been deletedso dont harp on me for not posting with it lol
wow the chair is making wide assumption now thats a big broad brush youre painting people with reason 34 as to why youre a horrible csm maybe youre just antigoon is that the real reason behind your tactics ahhh the voice for all of eve does have a personal agenda youre bringing in personal feelings about alliances corps players and alts to a board where you have failed to be open minded and represent all of evegolly
this is kind of a non issue because it embodies the very essence of eve its players that are side stepping what was intended when in truth it was intended all along eve is a game designed to give creative players the freedom to be creative why shouldnt a corp or alliance that believes in the cause of fw or wants to hurt another fw militia not be allowed to wardec whomever they want will destroying that 1 corp somehow harm the entire militia and make it ineffective unless the large majority of fw corps become wardecd by third party corps and alliances to the point that joining the fw as a corp just makes you a big target for a wardec based solely on that fact it remains a non issue this is eve no one is safe high sec is really just safer sec and low sec is all about who can tank the gate guns to gank youedit fixed safe sec to safer sec course it should be suicide gank sec but ya know p
well it seems to me that if you are realy interested excited passionate about fw and simply dont want to get caught up in the politicswar decs etc join as an individual directly into the militiaits that simple imho
looks like a good effort to make 00 more interesting
sounds somewhat reasonable with fast read thruim most excited about small gang harassment targets and was browsing for thread to support that would mention it it opens smaller gangs options to screw up their enemies isk making nicely structure resists can be used to balance it so that its relatively easy to repair those said structures moon mining labs but not as easy to shoot them down some overstreched alliances will prolly say its a nerf but i see it that the logistical stuff would most likely promote and require alliancescorps to look after their stuff better concentrate on one area maybe even opening some space for smaller entities to work fori dont really want to comment much on the sov mechanic change as long as it doesnt shorten siege times for systems it will probably be fine it should take several days to capture a system  having sov ping pong wouldnt be too fun for anyoneif brought up separately id fully support the small gang harrasment option even if the sov mechanic wouldnt change at once maybe put resistshp in line with like 10 bs shooting for 20min for moon miner etcedit ddd could exist in the future in my mind if it would be changed to suit current titan numbers say make it fire more often but half the dps fex every 15min 18th of current damage and shorten its range titan could still help you in fleet fights but not necessarily oneclickwin them they would be more vulnerable and the biggest problem would be if enemy brings 10 titans to the grid
err for those last few posts it has been fixed veldnaught is back where it belongs one question remains what about the other empire based caps
amarr  chribba and the veldnaught are one of the things in eve you have to see like the eve gate and all the other sites i conviced my friend tom to play the game for a few months by showing him the veldnaught and going thats a dreadnaught and that nice man chribba does a lot for the community tooseriously why take it awayedit oh its been fixed geekrage averted
does this mean all dreads can come back to highsectwo questions1 is this dread in the system amarr or in the amarr region2 what system is the eve gate in
bring back the silent giants they did no harm
arkonor and bistot in 00 is great it is like mining crack
is support this and suggest that collision detection be removed from drones since this would also reduce the problem of drone bumping which can result in drones preventing ships from aligning in combat its really stupid that drones could bump a battleship off course
there is no rational reason for a member of say the caldari navy to haul their buttocks to tcf space in order to pay tcf members to hunt down npc pirates who are operating in tcf space there is a reason for angel cartel to hire players to pursue cartel interests innear cartel space this is why there are no agents in tcf space but there are in cartel space the cartel pays for missions run on its behalf why shouldnt tcf pay for missions run on its behalf assuming such a thing were implementedagain if you want to do missions in nullsec they are already there and are known as exploration content the complexes you can find there are pretty much like missions but are generally much more rewarding and if you arent happy with that answer highsec or lowsec can meet your agent needsbesides how could you possibly claim with a straight face that 60m per month is a balanced amount to pay in exchange for a private l4 agent that only your alliance and its friends can use
lol righttau ceti want more missions hehehe
large sums of cash arent a rational reason or perhaps the idea of striking at the pirates where they live instead of just cutting them off whenever they invade tcf presumably does pay for missions run on its behalf  i assume they have cheapfree fleet combat ships and capital ships for members like most other alliancescomplexes are great if you can find them but doing so is incredibly inconvenient you want to work for a bigger profit you can if you dont then do missions and he did not claim that 60m a month is balanced he claimed he pulled it out of his ass
now see you just didnt think about this at all did youyou say in order to allow a newbie to play with his friend who is more experienced ccp should implement 00 agentsso what you are saying is that the newbie with no experience needs to be able to go to where the experienced player is to play with himill give you a minute to let it soak indonehow aboutnot changing the game and let the experienced player who knows the ropes just head up to empire to do some missions with his newbie frienddurrrrrrrrrrrredit as i read on i noticed people already responded to it and to that responsei would like to say that i actually have 3 rl friends that play eve aswell and ive never actually been in the same system as any of em mostly cuz theyre still in empire and im in deep 00 but that doesnt mean i cant convo them ingame and give them pointers etc and chat about eve in generaltbh i would get bored awefully fast doing lvl1 missions even if it was with a friend once youve done lvl4s and 00 it just isnt fun anymore no matter who you do it withthe same is true btw for dragging em out to 00 fresh from the shelves youll just scare them
had an idea it should be possible to give your outpost to npcs and then they would allow everyone to dock in there like normal npc station and would have agents in there
this as long as its your station you assign the missions and you pay the rewardsno inhouse isk tap for you
i like this idea provided agents are tied to allaince standings with various factions this would add and interesting interaction between alliance and npc empires
l1 and l2 missions would be great for training newbies which is why i supported this i was in 00 my first week of playing eve and i greatly enjoyed it the only problem is learning to rat and such was difficult yes for newbies you can take them around and pop the bs rats in the belt and such to let them finish off the small fry but if they ever want to do something when you arent on they are stuck a lot of times we do take newbies back to empire for a bit for training but if there were a way to spawn some small poor rats reliably for training it would be very helpful keep in mind that many complexes take scanning which is another thing many newbies cant do if you wanted to sprinkle some 1 or 2 static complexes in 00 it would solve the same issue
a newbie is not tied down anywhere they have no assets a vet on the other hand is tied down they have responsibilities rigged ships hangars the works thus the vet should stay still and the newbie should move and i didnt say that you had to be in the same system i said that some people would want to be a wellmade game lets people in large part do what they want you want to play with your friends  have a buddy nearby to bail you out the first time you do worlds collide say  then the game should let you without making anybody do backflips the newbie should not have to sit on his hands for a month and the vet should not have to abandon his corporation
well it was in a hauleri scouted the damn gate with an alt right before thoughyes you are right any decent combat ship would have survived hell i survived a 15man t2 04 gatecamp in a travel fitted drake by just turning on mwd and reapproaching gate while they were locking me and trying to get through my shield got me down to about 30 before i could jump outmy biggest concern though isnt that a broadsword or similar ship could kill a hauler on a 04 gate the biggest concern i have is that sometimes haulers need to go into 04 for stuff like agent missions etcnow if only battleships etc were able to solo camp 04 gates a hauler could probably make it out which would make it more fair in my opinionpersonally i used to do missions in gelfiven borders 2 04 systems untill new ships and probing patches came up and pirates started camping those 2 04 systems excessively and probing out missioners in those systemsi spent about an hour looking for a good lvl4 agent in empire that wont send you to 04 or below systems and found one good agent with 05 or above systems in all directions for 4 jumps just one missioning in empire just isnt fun anymore because of the constant fear of piratesprobers
bunch of people who dont know what they are talking abouthave you seen the setups we need to tank sentrys if anyone comes in a pvp fit we die luckily hardly anyone ever fights back
yea lets nerf em all 
then you scouted badly and its still your own fault for getting killedyou admit that and decently fit combat ship would have survived the engagement yet still think that you should be able to waltz on through in a none combat ship with near impunityreally sentry dps is right on the mark in my opinion it discourages solo gate camping whilst still being viable and it gives certain tactical advantages to an attacking side less drones no frigate hulls limited use of cruiser hulls lack of shield buffer on armour tankers lower cap from tanking less cap charges less gank the list goes on
ill support this even tho its been 3 years since ive been ganked at a gate
you can fit rigs on shuttlestheyre called frigates  interceptors my little atron is faster than a shuttle can mw too is not much more expensive and carries ten times as much i could be silly and stick a rig on too i supposeit would be cool if they did add either a shuttles skill or a t2 shuttle just for kickshow about a shuttle with a jump drive shuttle itself makes up 12 of the ship all the rest is all engine i think that falls in line with what ever you are smoking
great way for people to waste isks
i think super caps should have to burn fuel like poss the provide posoutpost like services so they should burn some fuel this might also reduce the huge build up of titans i think cost should be around 2 billion per month to maintain mostly in isotopes and strontium
only if the titan can provide a pos bubble and jump bridge pos guns in with it
agreed bangs on tablewe the multitudinous horde who also vote for things like csms of high sec carebears are 80 of the population and we are forced to live in 20 of the spacethis is not equitable i can yell tooits getting kind of hard to care for our pelts due to the lack of space you know groominglow sec is by the admission of the people who currently live there underused and undervaluedsolutionremove low sec in its current form make space either empire no change npc 00 no change conquerable npc 00 and player 00 you keep what you can killthats right folks conquerable npc 00 which would be what is currently called low secmake the systems conquerable through faction warfare only putting up pos in such conquered systems can only be done by corps which are part of the owning faction militia if they leave the militia the pos goes offline at the next dt and such pos do not require charters systems that are conquered get gate guns from the owning faction over a period of timestations in such systems have no docking fee for people in the same factions milita neutrals using such stations get a fairly large docking bill isk sink opfors cannot dock in a conquered system but if the system becomes contested then they can again dock allow moon mining etc under the above conditions this gives fw corps incentive to both defend capture fight for and develop spaceif all neighbouring systems are either that faction empire or also conquered by that faction then that system is no longer frontline and concord moves in to police it at say 04 response times but actually spawning at incidents should the system become frontline again however concord withdraws from that systemas systems are captured more would become quasi high sec the appearance of concord even with the slowed response time means high sec carebears would move into the new space and utilise it providing external logistics to the fw corpsagents in the stations become militia agents while it is under the sway of a faction militia if it is contested then they remainrevert to what they currently are this means if you want to run missions in those conquered systems you have to be part of the militia militias get lp stores in their own conquered stations kills on opposing militia giving lpsrats would be as normal in contested militia space and would be of the pirate faction opposed to the owning militia in conquered militia space killing such rats in conquered space should give a positive to militia standings not sec status and lps for use in militia storesattacks on militia members should give a negative to standings with that militia and a bonus to its opposing milita standings possibly to the opposing factions pirates too too much negative and you become a target of that militia as sec status does for concord this to avoid issues with non militia corps deccing militia corps eventually the whole militia can shoot the deccing corpi believe this would give a point to militia warfare improve the utilisation of what is currently low sec and provide a lot more warfareindustry opportunitiesan island of high sec surrounded by warring militias and pirates both npc and player which is itself surrounded by pilot alliances who have gone beyond the eye of empire factionsdons flame proof suithey its an idea i thought it out while i was making the post discuss it rip it to shreds come up with other ideas naybe well get a gestalt idea to present to the csm
the title of this thread may be deemed    erm    offensive    due to certain historical    considerations   just a heads up   
nvm please delete this forum just ed up
not supported bcos of point 7 without that might even sign this
agreed agreed yes and no removing all loot means creating a dynamic in the game that is directly oppose to mission runners and no one else removing all basic tech 1 loot drops from any source would be preferable since you can loot farm in complexes far better than you can in missions agreed super agreed i dont really agree with this but only because i feel its unnecessary and will still be abused there are certain areas where a large number of lvl 4 agents are gathered together in close proximity so the population would move to these areas and spread out the quality difference and still drive down the total server performance not going to say no to this either just dont really careagreed with your view of how lvl 4s should be managed in high sec rather than removed all together agreedoh and thanks for qualifying your position rather than getting on the forum and trying to brow beat people into submission on a topic your clearly biased on if you know who i am talking about
everything malcanis has in this post even the stuff i snipped for brevity i completely support and totally agree withitll make the game more roleplay as well and if these changes were to come about id actually pull the dust cover off my mission bbnot because id make more isk  because it would be funoh  to clarify i think missions should be extremely variable within the expected range for a mission of that level in other words some might turn out to be a cakewalk and others literally impossible even for the best mission runner to try without friends of the same caliber meaning other frigatedd pilots for l1s or more bb or bb support vessels in l4sthis should not be known by the agent or the runner in advance yes  sometimes you should have to warp out going ow  i cant do this alone intelligence is always an inexact thing i used to be in usaf intel when i was in the service and misintel by the agent both up and down should play a big part in missions
yes it needs looked intoit takes a massive amount of mining to complete them and their payout is much less than simply selling the ore would have been they at least need to pay you base price of the minerals it would refine to also mining agents give a startling number of kill missions for a probable barge pilot
or how about thisdont use the enter key on the number pad that way you and your stubby fingers wont keep screwing up
up to now there was noone against bringing this buglist to ccps attention so who from csm will do it and when i propose next csm  ccp meetingregards eve g
you might like to go and review the lastest patch notes for the upcoming expansion bugs are fixed when reported by the look of it maybe the csm can now spend time on other issues instead of bug fix requests and tweaks etctake carearithron
while i dont agree that all of the suggested areas are actual problems i do agree that fw needs a look at and all of your issues merit real and impartial discussion
i disagree with this currently all corps within your faction are able to counter war dec if you cannot convince anyone to do so perhaps you need to work on your diplomacy having just left fw i have to say there were corps that were on my side i would just as soon shot at myself dont ask people to fight your conflicts for you fw is supposed to be an introduction to 00 pvp with training wheels asking the devs to change game mechanics because you cant coordinate a defense for yourself is rather silly there are other points in there i could support but i wont support this thread because of this one point
militia members cant wardec these corps not all people inside fw is in a corp also is more fun for all more targets
everything needs to be taken through the grinder again examined with a fine toothed comb support
while im sure many of these suggestion have be brought up now and then i thought it would be good to bring these ideas to the table and ask for additional suggestions where conceptually fleet mechanics can be optimised to keep blob warfare playable1gun groupingplayers should have the option of linking all the same gunlauncher types into one groupthis group would in effect merge all the guns in to 1 group button on the ui and for the purpose of the server calculation be worked out as 1 gun with a damage multiplier based on how many guns are in the groupthis i believe would reduce considerably the amount of information packets being set between the server and clients regarding gun activations reloading overheating etcthe additional benefit of this would be that grouped guns would all change there ammo at the same time so long as there are enough charges to fill the entire rack2remove collision detection between fleet shipsover a certain number of ships on gridin fleet the server switches over and discards calculation and modelling of the collision physics this would need to occur only between ships within the fleet itself and not interaction between hostile ships mainly because bumpage is a effective mechanic to prevent capssupcaps from getting to safety of they are caught outside shields or are trying to warp awayi also think at a certain point dronefighter blobs should also be disregarding for collision detection in order to free up resources for more important informationcalcs3group fighters and dronesim a bit unsure about this idea because while there would be massive benefit regarding reduction of all the information from a swarm of fights i can see a lot of issues with what happens when they take damage or a targetedi guess the server needs to be able to group fighter damage from a fighterdrone wing possibly group them into a formation in order to reduce positionalflight information and treat them separately when being targeted or damaged4watch list prioritisationonly ships with remote logistics should be prioritised for watch list updates any time the servers load starts getting heavy then watchlist updates slow or stop for those not prioritised in saying that i also feel that there should be ships automatically flagged as important which dont stop getting updated those being super caps i think its still important to know the status of friendly titansmoms especially if your trying to fight off the attackers5doomsday killmailsits been my experience that when a successful doomsday goes off the node is pretty much dead for the next 2030 minutes as all the kill mails get generatedkillmails need to be dealt with on a separate server from the node server perhaps all ships and there fittings need to be dumped onto a separate server all kills dumped there as well and left to develop all the kill mails away from the main action where post dd combat is trying to take place if need be lock all the wreaks until the server is able to update them with what survivedthe kill mails themselves dont need to be instantly available to the pilots and can be trickled back into the character sheets over a period of time

come on
a very excellent post was made hereheres the ideai personally think that its a very neat idea and it seems to address some of the biggest flaws in the current designmy suggestion is that we propose this to ccp as a way for which the csm document should recommend the next csm to do not to say they cant have a weekly meeting but a meeting in a chat is not quite as efficient as the proposed idea
obviously supported my reasons are in the op
gotta give a bit of support
more efficient  okbtw csm always create such a forum by themselves if they desire
we havent created one ourselves for transparency and continuity reasons
id personally be against making suggestions that the next csm has to adhere to just because this current csm has had some issues with meetingsdiscussions and suchlike it doesnt follow that the next csm willthe problems with a forum are1 csm members actually have to read and post replies ie care about the process2 how does such a process stop illfeeling and encourage cooperation and development within the csm 3 you are likely to see camps forming on issues especially if they are not thought through before being posted etc ie poor issues theres nothing wrong with different opinions mind youhowever issues that are vague or tooencompassing eg 00 sov fixing end up with pointless debate with neither side shifting since there is an illdefined problem or both sides cant agree what the problem actually is4 how is having a forum for 9 players to discuss issues etc any different than a forum for any player 245000 to post and discuss issues ie the assembly hall its still forum discussing giving no sense of togetherness or identity to a csm 5 the csm would be suddenly apart from the playerbase since thered be no need to post etc on assembly hall or jita park and this detachment could be harmful to the original aims of having a csm in the first place to me the problems with the current csm arent traceable to not having forums to discuss things in its due to some members of the csm failing to discuss things at allmeetings are essential imo csm canadidates all knew what would be required late nights for meetings discussion via forums with players putting together documents for submission etc the perk of the job afterall is an expenses paid trip to iceland using money ultimately derived from players via subscriptionsmerchandise etc this responsibility to the players to act on behalf of players shouldnt be something that is made easier because i dont like a 4 hr meeting every 2 weeks or the like the current system would work if the csm made it work had clear guidelines and expectations and stuck to them and everyone pulled their weight and contributed in all areas that such a position requires its all to easy to look for reasons to justify why one couldnt do something the much harder path is to front up and work with whats available to do what is required and what one was elected to dotake carearithronps for these reasons not supported
i raised this idea weeks agoif the next csm doesnt have time zone problems at least as bad as the current csm ill eat my hat you are not going to get nine europeans or nine americans there will be a mix of those two at best at worst youll get a russian an australian and a hawaiian just to make things really nasty with the exception of oz this was a good csm for time zones also given how much better the proposed meeting structure is than the status quo i dont think anybody on the new csm will have trouble living with it i expect a large proportion of the membership to be existing csmers since reelection is allowed so if this gets passed then youve probably got majority support right there 1 if they dont care no format will save the csm 2 given time to actually discuss things in depth you might get people understanding each other instead of caricaturing there are limits in all thingsjade and darius but i think itd help 3 youre describing the status quo 4 you dont see the difference between 9 people elected for having a vision and the ability to express it and 245000 people who mostly dont and wouldnt care to forums always get better as the number of stupid people and incomprehensible posts goes down and a forum for 9 elected people seems nearoptimal for that 5 it would be publicly readable and ideally on the eve forums thats better than can be said of the current chatlogs
i did recall that someone else had raised something like that some time ago i just couldnt find itwould you mind linking your post so that we can include it thanks
you dont see the difference between 9 people elected for having a vision and the ability to express it and 245000 people who mostly dont and wouldnt care tothis statement of course assumes that the people elected did have the vision and the ability to express it this would have of course made some of them attractive to alliances that supported themi would also question the express it part some of them do some dont do much at all in public but front at meetingstake carearithron
it was in my reply to the last csm meeting also that wasnt an attack or anything it was just an explanation of my support most of them were elected for being intelligent wellconsidered and expressing a vision darius is about the only one who seems like an exception  and thats not to say he didnt have a vision just that it wasnt why he got in and the thing about elections is you dont have to do bugger all after you get elected as long as you do enough before its sad that a couple seem to act that way though unavoidableive never seen a volunteer committee where 13 of the membership didnt float away i really dislike people who do that but theres not much i can do about them
im in total agreement with you regarding csm members having a vision etc however misguided some may think individual ones may be the problem with a forumbased meeting system is that the opportunity to do bugger all is more available in a way at least at an online meeting they may interject or participate in at least some issue discussions since they are present etcid be convinced of forummeetings if the voting occurred in an online meeting ie all discussion of issues would already be complete there is a risk that csm members could become disinterested in a totally forumbased csm in addition regular discussion or development meetings should go handinhand with the forum discussion this makes the csm interact with each other and gives them a feeling of purpose and togetherness another large problem facing the csm is the lack of participation in both voting and forum discussions jita park and assembly hall by the majority of the eve player base that is another thread though me thinkstake carearithron
have ccp increase your exit speed from the station by 5x in addition to a timerbig ships will take forever to turn around and head back inbesides anyone leaving one of those wierdly aligned stations that block jumps without a long slug away from the station to the nearby gates will be gratefulfw needs to see the addtion of factional outposts in enemy territory and the elimination of hostile factions being able to dock at friendly friendly faction stations
ccp says that station huggin carier killing your fleet cruiserbc docking when tank fails is fine right

never read much but i hate pos and sov warfare like you said in the op so thumbs up anyway
good idea

i propose that ccp put all moon minerals complexes highend asteroids and highend rats in low sec the lower the sec status the lower level of materials because that is were the easy industry is and the harder industry is closer to the border of an empires space or going out of their space to do industry this would help fix the balance for riskreward also change the size of 00 roids so that they pop from one or two cycles of a strip miner and limit how much ice spawns on roids in 00 saying that the guristasangelswhoever mines so much of it off size of roids increases as you move to higher sec status areasthe rp reason for materials moving is that with peace and other things not going on in 00 they have been farmed out this means that the newer materials spawn farther and farther from 00 the roids increasing in size would be caused by the empires not building a million titans to sit around doing nothing in
posting to support my own thread
sounds sensible supported
signed this is a great idea 00 space should have never been meant for carebears just a places for newbies to get their feet wet before venturing into lowsec
for some reason i have gut feeling its trolling thread im willing to support that
omfg they posted with all their alts you wanna friggin get the isk sellers rich what the  is that highsec high payload of rare minerals that s plain dumb why would anyone want to hold 00 space then just for kicks get a life imo and stop making trials to support your threads
this char is my own alt not the original posters ps i dont think trials can vote  as far as alts in general go every account has one voice want to put more veight into your opinion  well put your money where your mouth is and get more accounts would not be first time we would see argument in forums where someone is pwning the other until the winning side by accsident post counterargument against itself that was supposed to be posted by the losing side i always laugh hard about that 
when ecms were so powerful that they were recomended equipment on most ships ccp nerfed the strength of the ecm module then boosted the bonus of ecm specialty ships to compensate it makes a lot of sense to do the same thing for damp specialty ships to allow them to make use of the module while leaving the module less useful for nonspecialty ships
i support to looking at the bonuses for the kereslachesisarazu
i agree completely further more the constant use of the word lame in a derogatory context within eve is an insult to people with physical disabilitiesccp please ban all players who use the word lame to describe anything but a physically challenged individual heroically striving to make the most out of their lifethank you i look forward to your immediate attention to this matter
alot of these issues could be avoided if you just kept your personal details out of a game about internet spaceships if you must broadcast your personal life however be prepared for people who have different opinions personal harassment is covered pretty well under the eula im all for personalized word filters since anything else is an intrusion on free speech which is a grave and slippery slopeon another note youre going to encounter alot of incharacter bigotry crime and general nastiness thats the nature of eve just as its human nature in our world if you get offended by certain words and views easily you may want to find a different mmo
someone in everquest once tried to argue their right to free speech as an excuse for deliberately trying to offend others by bad language i believe the argument was along the lines ofthe game servers and indeed the forum servers are a privately owned environment the owners of that environment can enforce any damn rule they like whether it curtails free speech or not if you dont like that write your own game and run your own forums and enforce the rules you want to see enforced
no noob areaseve shouldnt be a game that holds your hand in any way
i am not convinced that the csm will have much of a lifespan beyond the current termive noticed that there is a far lower volume of posts being made in the assembly hall of late and the ones which are being made are often repeat issues or relatively minor points i dont know if this is just because we are still in holiday season or if people have put in their pet rants and are recovering for round 2 or what but this is directly in contrast to the vision that ccp seems to have had for the csm as noah ward chief programming supremo put it in his interview they were hoping for big picture ideas from the csm rather than niggling little issueshowever the csm in its current form is only ever going to generate these little issues edit  with the exception of the work of some members who are already doing precisely what im about to talk about  lavava voom and his trade  industry analysis for one and as time goes on and issues continue to be raised those issues are just going to get smaller already i rather pity ccp for the next set of submissions from the csm i dont know how many issues have been voted to be elevated to having a finger pointed at them with look at this please pinned on but since the iceland meeting it must be in excess of 100 by now for all its scope eve is still a finite game  so what will remain for the next set of csm delegates after all the best most passionately argued ideas have already been raised by the current incumbents if its just going to be issues like ship x needs an extra 10 cpu then csm cannot achieve what ccp wants it toim not sure how to fix that i wonder if ccp needs to designate specific areas that they want to see a long term proposal for the future arise from and people could stand for election to those specific positions on the csm for example they might want to see an improvement in the way missions are dealt with so one of the csm positions would have special responsibility for missions and at the end of the term would be expected to collate a grand plan for missions based on player input via forums and their own expertise for especially thorny issues like the perennial how to fix low sec or how to make pvp less about blobbing there might be two or even more positions assignedof course the csm has an additional responsibility in that they dont work for ccp  the players still need a channel to have their issues escalated there would be scope for that if ccp doesnt try to address everything at once maybe they could have say 5 of the 9 positions with special responsibility for particular issues and the other 4 be delegates without portfolioi dont know if the above would work but i do think that something needs to change to allow the next incarnation of the csm to work on what the boys and girls in reykjavik are expecting if ccp just see a stream of increasingly niggling little issues coming at them from csm mk 2 they will lose patience with the whole process and call it off  and that would be a bad thing
i think this is a good analysis actually but how should this be worked out should the csm become more of a 2way thing where once every quarter a new set of issues23 at max are raised to the community and based on all the feedback the csm is to come up with an extensive report of some sort which should be sent to ccp and discussed with the aim to improve the current mechanics based on this feedback i think that could be quite interesting and it would promote communication as well as working together on larger issues but again we have to consider that the csm is intended for a way for the community to raise concerns i already talked about how i hate ship balancing issues with a passion while its somewhat utopia to totally rule out these kinds of issues i think it might be beneficial to try and limit the frequency of these issuesthe csm should promote good discussion and give the less vocal players to get their opinions trough this is not done very well in the current way its being donei assume thats me i should totally change my name to that tbh awesome name
it should be a case of setting up the rules in such a way that the situation is covered under them as opposed to hitting a situation and changing the rules to suit however this is a minor issue compared to what i personally see as a huge stumbling block in the csm processthe meetings themselves how many times have we seen the chatlogs of a meeting where1 the elected 9 csm members are all presentand2 one or more of the elected csm members hasnt had to leave halfway through a meeting to deal with personal matters  disconnections  sleep etc thus forcing an overreliance on the presence of the alternative csm membersthis unfortunately is unavoidable in the current meeting format as it relies on being able to get 9 people from wildly different timezones on the same chat channel for an extended period of time usually multiple hours at a specific time this is difficult enough with the 9 core csms with timezones stretching from america to denmark however when you also add in the alternatives you extend that timezone round to australiaa possible alternative format would be an official csm discussion forum specifically for discussion and voting between the csm members on issues that have come through the assembly hall public discussion threadsthis would lead to the following benefits as its a forum format all 9 csm members dont need to be online simultaneously to discuss an issue as the discussion threads and votes are a matter of public record it eliminates the need to have seperately posted minutes this forces csm members to take a more active role in pre vote discussions as people are able to see for themselves just how active theyre being more issues can be addressed as youre not time restricted by how long people can stay online less reliance on alternative csm members instead the alternatives can be called up if something occurs to affect a core csms ability to post for an extended period of time ie holiday  forum ban though this should result in the removal of the csm and the alternative moved up to become a core csm member  illness etc less confusion when issues are being addressed as each person will be able to finish what theyre saying before people reply how many times has a csm thrown up a point  in the middle of what someone is saying only to retract it when their concern is addressed in the very next post as the ingame chat forces a break due to posting limits i know the forum has a posting limit also however it does allow you to write more than a paragraph before cutting you offanyway need to get back to work now so ill cut this off hereedit forgot that id posted this idea on the first page of this thread
i fully agree it would be the in my eyes ideal way of doing itwe should really ask for ccp to do thisedit go support here
after reading the various past posts referred to below i retract this statement and apologise for offence causedpost made here regarding an idea 3 minutes later youve read it considered the suggestion and then decided to post it as an issue on the assembly hall all this without waiting for others to discuss the idea or point out pitfalls etcif by some small chance the original poster of the idea isnt connected to you in any way imo that precisely this sort of random posting of issues without thorough thought is why the csm is in the state it is meetings taking hours members not talking to each other agendas with very little gamechanging issues that affect majority of players etc etca better way might have been to actually use this thread for its prime purpose to discuss and develop issues afterall you have posted an idea in the assembly hall which isnt the issue at allso hard to vote on etctake carearithron
no the csm already bounced around this very idea during iceland and it has been mentioned a few times on the forums that it would be a good idea so when i read the wellwritten post i took the chance and posted it on the assembly hall for further discussionwhat exactly are you trying to say that this person is an alt of mine or a friend of mine neither is true its a slippery slope to make such strong statements do assume everything you know is all there is to know or do you just make a lot of assumptionsexactly what the idea tries to solvewhat how would you know i agree and already addressed it several times in my postsits an idea for discussion you will notice that i rarely if ever raise an issue to a meeting unless its welldiscussed tell me where exactly did i also state that i dont want to discuss the idea in the thread itself thats a bit lame
this topic was brought up weeks agoby me at a minimum though im not sure if i was the first and he expressed support for it he just finally got annoyed enough to post a thread on the topic and really the issue of terrible meeting structure is one of the biggest problems with the csm at present members leaving quorums disappearing good issues being ignored because there isnt enough time to discuss them no debate of any substance  the list goes on forumbased meetings are the best and most important change to internal processes that the csm could make
well is the assembly hall where ideas are discussed or do you mean its an idea for csm discussion this forum thread would ideally be the place for such a discussion by other csm members to express their views etcwhich is really what is neededi would go along with forum meetings for issuesvoting if the chat meetings were held on a regular basis for discussion of specific issues before being posted on forum or vision type issue development and problem definition both systems would be required imo to be a really effective csmtake carearithron
to clear a few points upmembers not talking to each other well you said so yourself on scrapheaparithron wrotelv do you discuss all your ideas with a good crosssection of the csm before posting eg banedarius  serenity dierdra hardin note this is a good range of different playstylesspheres only and does not in anyway reflect ability to think lavista replied no i havent really some of the stuff i have discussed with ankhmainly the t1 loot stuff and the stock market parts with serenity but mainly i discuss with people from the communityactually its my opinion hence the imo i make assumptions based on the evidence available to me but my opinions derive from both my life experiences and my impressions of others coupled with my sense of wellbeing and state of mind at any given time taking into account any knowledge i may have which i may also ignore in opinion formationim going to stop any personal remarks now and apologise if i have caused offence i blame it all on the very recent arrival of a new family member depriving me of sleeplets get back to making the csm a valuable player asset for the future and develop the ideas being discussedtake carearithron
bumping this issue back up frontmaybe the csms just dont give a damn but itd be worthwhile to say something
what are the chances of ccp doing anything about this i have a nag still need to do a lil training before it is battle ready i was hoping not to have to train torps there was a poat ealier in the forums sayin the where going to reveiw it this month will ccp tell us we are waisting our time or will i have to check this post everyday for the rest of my life anyone know what kinda chance we have of getting this fixed or at least a time framethanks everyone
make a new capital ship call it a pos and have all the modules on it be the guns hangers labs etcfly it out to the spot park it anchor it fire up the station shield use it unanchor it fly to a new spot rinse repeator maybe this could be the titan redesign t2 version that is looming in the distant future
and just imagine how bad it would have been if had to do it on a mac
support
okay now i feel dumb for bumping this
i dont care if it is builtin or a 3rd party app who ever does this deserves a nice cup of hot sex
reduce blobs the game can not currently handle
my main character is a gallente who flies amarrian ships needless to say a nano nerf would help me out tremendously even so i am against iti enjoy the uphill challenge of countering nano tactics with my limited abilities so why mess with it i also like the thought of minmatar ships outrunning cruise missiles that means that a raven needs to rely on an interceptor to take down a nano fleet so it builds teamwork is teamwork suddenly a bad enough thing that ccp should discourage itfinally its fun to zoom around at top speed period this nano nerf is like the nation of india deciding to shave a few thousand feet off the top of mt everest its a waste of time energy and resources thats gonna change the way we look at the world  ppl off and bog down ccp when they could be focusing on other issues such as what new ships or skills to roll out in the next build
very annoyingsometimes cant see whether a module is active or not
so far so good 100 support keep them coming guys
you mean have a checking and savings acount in evebrilliant
damn i whuld love this
yeah that will be awesome 
hell ya
here here jolly nice idea i would quite like a savings fund that i can put money in and perhaps put a timer on so that i cant take it out for x number of days
i support the nerfmake missles as effective as gunsmake speed no longer be the end all be all factor that it is today
am for a nano nerf in general but not this overdone stuff i hear of in sisiplz make it a little more refined ccp
for the nano nerf
theyll need something else to do with all those dreds out in 00 anyhow after they move sov away from siege warfare which is already on the drawing boards why not mining keep the output under 23rds what a hulk can do and youre golden
ok good one fine
chribbaveldnaughtsiege modecapital mining lazzors yesalso it should make an awesome sound like a huge vacuum perhapsanyone else  no its about time chribba got some official recognition imo
posted by someone that has no grasp of the real problem by making high sec space baren wont drive many people to lowsec space it will drive them out of the gameits irrelevant if they put neked ladies dancing on the stations in low sec space the risk to nonpvpers is still unacceptablewhy dont they just make an all low sec universe that all you pvpers can go and make another player friendly universe for everyone else maby then the game could attract more than a token number of players
no whats out of control is the influx of non pvpers to a pvp game these people obviously dont like the game as its a pvp game so they do their best to change it the most common method is by holding ccp ransom with their accounts
before you guys start suggesting moving level 4 missions to losec what about just having level 4 missions limited to t1 hullsthe iskhr earnings that ive seen claiming 20m iskhr are from those folks that run with marauders fleeted with salvaginglogistics altshisec level 4 missions are essential income for lowsp characters certainly restrict the classes of ship that can enter hisec mission spacesyes i support the discussion no i do not agree with the original posters suggestion that level 4 missions should be moved to lowsecbesides op gives no basis for the suggested nerf apart from being in goonfleet whose stated purpose is to screw up the game for everyone else
i get 25mhr in a cnr thats a t1 hull
i dont believe you prove itit used to be that losec was much more lucrative than hisec and at that time it was much more populatedwhats your evidence
why did you join a pvp game if you dont like pvp
actually lowsec emptied a short while after revelations released risk increased dramatically due to two primary changesprobes killed lowsec combined with the wcs nerf it was no longer profitable to stay in lowsec to do missions because you would lose more isk in ships than the additional profits providedi remember the screams on the forums in dec and jan of that year and the whining of former corp mates when their mission ravens could only lock to 18 km
because the game itself is fun pvp or no pvp personally i avoid pvp except under specific situations making money to buy shineys is not one of those times that doesnt mean i wont gleefully shoot at an ore thief wander through lowsec when its been a bad day shoot at a mission thief after i verify he doesnt have friends in local etc at times take those things away and the game would be stale and boringbut i also didnt sign up for counterstrike in space which is what most pvpers think eve is supposed to be
do you think balancing level 4 missions would turn this game into counterstrike in space
no i think it would make combat less profitable and less likely to happenthat comment is more directed at all the residual whining about nerfing suicide ganking etc which is directly related to this topic according to most posts in support of it now that level 4 missioning is 100 safe because of suicide nerfs we need to balance level 4sisnt that the whine of the week
no it would reduce random gointolowsecwithexpensivebattleshipandblowsomerandomup pvp it would vastly increase combat among those living in lowsec because the space there would actually be valuable and worth fighting over
wish this risk vs reward whining would stop soonthose so called carebears you keep talking about actually help a great deal in keeping the cost of rigs and ships downif you remove that from high sec the price on ships will go up and the price on rigs will sky rocketnot signed at alllet the carebears stay in empire and build ships that i can blow up
constellation sov been here for awhile now and removing pos from sov not good idea but def needs tweeking and the use of plexes and such to maintain sov is no good since for the most part sov holding alliances focus on pvp more than those aspects of the game in addition to the afk miners and farmers that would then gain sov with bots doing all the work
forgot to mention the offlined place holding poss that clutter everything up  if its offline for more than 30 days it should be able to be stolen this would for the most part put an end to pos spamming entie regions of space and allowing the towers to go off line and still maintain control of systems and moonscans disappear make the hundreds of small poss just sitting in claimed space off line not a point of contentionthis in itself would make small gang warfare a viable threat to large space holding alliances forcing them to fuel and maintain them or suffer the threat of small gangs coming in unanchoringreanchoring them using them for a base of operations within the system not a cure for pos problem but maybe some in roads to the solution
make eve ships twoseaters this is right out of left field but im not actually sure its a bad idea id like to see what ccp does with this idea try crossposting this to fi  the devs reply to some threads there id be curious about what they said
would be a fantastic way to train pilots
yeah that is the simple answer but clearly not what the devs had in mind or they would have just let alliances in from the gitgo i think its a shame we have a csm member promoting sidestepping their intent but there you go well just have to see if they do anything about it or not
why should jade want the way its done changedafter all herhis entire alliance is wardeccing all corps that are joining the caldari militia pretty much at this point thus influencing the fw in favour the caldari militias enemiesi agree that something needs to be done how about this1 give the corps that join a fw militia a nonwardec status like npc corps get this way while your corp is involved as part of the fw militia you cant be wardecced by non fw militia corps and you are also not able to wardec any corp that isnt part of a fw militia 2 if your corp has open wardecs on them when they try to join they have to be settled prior to joining either by surrendering or what ever before the corp can join a fw militia3 if your corp leaves the fw milita any current wardecs are automatically cancelledthis would protect fw corps from massive alliances wardecing them just because they are annoyed they cant join the fw on mass as an alliance if the alliance wants to wardec fw corps then they have to split up join fw militias of thier choice and play on a level playing field just like everyone else
agreed
do it
i want the nanoed out speedmining ship of doom fly through the belts at 11k with a big scoop in the front ramming roid into your hold as you go dont need no stinking lasersblow through enemy bubble camps jake all their arkonor and laugh at them as you speed away all those nanopilots who are going to go through withdrawl soon can become industrial terrorists
want to make more money mine arkanor or bistot or even mercoxit now in 00 i dualbox hulks and i average 90120mil an hour they arent even skilled that well too
i dont recall saying caldari navy or any conventional factions need to be involved at all it could be restricted to pirate factions andor factions that have significant interests in 00 already as far as the 60mil per month i do believe i already made a disclaimer regarding that in the opnonspecifically not you becq if you need to smack my idea thats fine but if you need to smack tcf please take it to caod or stfu thanks 
   lag is the critical issue    this topic is meant to encourage discussion of server side lagplease include the following in your posts1situations where lag most frequently occurs2proposed solutions to lag in those situationssample post1solar systems completely lock up for all involved fleet members during fleet battles with 300 or more players fleet battles function as a chaotic form of turn based module activation2invest in server hardware as opposed to new content developmentthank you
ok i start with the most common and obvious situationlag in jita jumping into the system docking into the station undocking from the station can take up to 45min that was the longest time i waited before creating a stuck petition when doing this fridaysaturdaysunday at rushhour most time with a black screen without the possibility to cancel lag for any operation warp sell buy write mail whatever can be more then 2min during rushhour the lag increases significantly towards the downtime its most awful a few min before dt so there seems to be an aging problem bad garbadge collector memory leaks locked resources  other games have no regular dt and stay online for month without any aging problemin my opinion any blackscreen longer then a few seconds is unacceptableand a 2min lag can actually not be called lag anymore its more an asynchronous time difference between actions and their effectssolutions solve the problem not the symptoms reduce the amount of data that is transfered to the required minimum see observer pattern in any good programming pattern book split the users into logical groups to reduce the complexity of the problem devide and conquor a character jumping into jita should not concern me while i am docked in the station all that i need it the few bytes telling me that he is now in showing it in the local window dont beleive that this problem will disapper from itself by players beeing to annoyed and then use other trading hubs a trader has no real alternative and will more likely stop playing eve solve the aging issue use memory leak tools ectregardseve g
ship tanks are better sentry guns havent improvedimprove sentry guns  it may be one of the steps that gets more people to go into low sec
not to rain on anybodys parade but i dont see why anything needs to be changed adding extra complications to the already complicated process of cap ship constructionmaintenanceuse will only serve to benefit the stronger and larger corporations in this game much in the same way that corporate taxes kill off entrepreneurs while increasing profits for large multinational corporations in the real world if it aint broke dont fix it please
so bringing a dozen titans and who knows how many carriers is acceptableonce upon a time the titan was introduced as an awesome and incredible support craft it could do the doomsday oncehour and provide the whole fleet with buffs in the meantimethen people conquered enough space and made rediculous amounts of isk and started mass producing the damned things now theres no need to bring anything but a dozen titans just jump them in one at a time and dd the field until everything is deadif by any chance there are survivors then a few carriers can deploy about 500 fighters to mop upnow im sure that capitals online sounds like fun to some but i sure as hell dont want to participate in a nuclear holocaust with a bb gun in my handwhereas adding some sort of limitation to what is otherwise a completely out of control playstyle may seem unfair to the alliances who are wftbbqpwning the whole universe with their overwhelming tactics its only putting things back into balance a bitthis is a game and when everyone but the bully thinks its not fun anymore then its time to change the game
why stop at capitalsthe only cost that would be incurred upon a ship is maintenance cost of the crew wages food entertainment and all ships in eve require crewsso if your going to say i need pay ongoing maintenance for a cap ship above and beyond that of combatmovement depletables then i say you should also be required to pay ongoing cost for your lowly frigates cruiser or battleshipi suppose this would be a nice buff to amarr pilots as they can delete a sizable part of their maintenance costs by not paying wages to their crew
often enough when you have a load of drones in your drone bay you will group them just to get a bit of a structure and organisation in your drone bay but if you want to launch a couple of different class drones you will also get a not so easy manageable view in your drone in local space tabespecially carrier motherships which carry around a lot of drones and not only fighters and i havent met anyone yet who only put fighters in a carrier will make groups just to keep his 200 drones drone bay just a bit overviewable but when you launch say 1012 drones and say you got drones out of 3 groups you will get a pretty unmanageable overview especially when you need to click through dozens of groups just to find the right ones and personally i dont see why you would need drone groups in space for me the only usefulness is when they are stored in the dronebaymy suggestion therefore is is either to remove the groups when your drones enter local space or to add a setting under the drones setting where you can put this function on or offthis would make controlling drones in space just a bit more overviewable
i like this plan
1 missions need to be made more dynamic and unpredictablei dont agree boring missions mean people losing interest and finding something else to dohowever npcs that occasionally retarget and start firing on people entering mission space will encourage missionrunners to take ships into missions that are more suited to pvp play and thus encourage them to move to the more profitable level 5 missions in lowseca simple solution would be for npcs to target the most recent arrival within range this is still predictable enough for missionrunners to be able to grind their isk up to support their gtc and lowsecnullsec play while simultaneously reducing the risk to mission runners by giving them an advantage over piratesthe isk must flow for mission runner to go2 mission payout in lowsec and 00 needs improvementits not so much the payout that needs improvement as much as the risk that requires reduction a missionrunner engaged in a mission is extremely vulnerable to pirates first due to the fact that theyre in a missionrunning setup not a pvp setup and second the fact that theyre already engaged in combat with a fleetthe mere presence of a mission runner in a lowsec system will attract pirates its a given that pirates will intrudeperhaps if npcs were to retarget when other people enter mission space there might be some redress to the risk vs reward of lowsec missions of any level3 module loot has a negative impact on the economy by making t1 production obsolete and injecting too many minerals into the economyi agree remove unnamed t1 loot from npcs remove mineral loot from drones let them drop rig materials instead4 missions in factional warfare require improvementsi am not engaged in fw but from what ive heard agents will sometimes send solo pilots on missions 20 jumps into enemy territory that doesnt sound particularly appealing to me5 mining missions require improvementsmining is about iskhr if the mining mission doesnt pay out equivalent to what the miner could make in the same time by just mining why would they run the missionadd losec ores to hisec mining missions for example this provides an incentive for people to scout out mining mission deadspaces to mine those ores this would make mining itself more interestingin fact id go so far as to remove all ores apart from veldspar from hisec belts and put the other stuff exclusively into deadspaces that either belong to missions mining or combat or exploration sitesthe devs have already stated that they were looking at moving belts to nonsystem space anyway why not just take them away altogether and put ores into missionexploration deadspaces6 agents are static resulting in overloaded mission hubs desire to have agent quality made dynamictwo thumbs up for this suggestion agent quality should decrease as they hand out more and more missions agent quality should increase every downtime the decrease should be enough that they will degrade from day to day if they hand out more than 1100 missions a day thats enough to sustain 50 concurrent mission runners who can complete one mission an hour7 level 4 missions in their current form do not belong in highsecurity spacebulldust malcanis cant come up with any better reason than some equivalent of theyre cramping my style8 standing is being monopolized by missions no ways to get standing outside of mission running with the exception of fw standingperhaps empires could put bounties on the heads of people who are disliked by that faction this gives the missionrunnerhaters a means to address their too many level 4 mission runners in hisec concernsthe bounty could increase exponentially in value both isk and standings adjustment as the deviation from 0 becomes greater
in agreementi also agree with other posters that lowsec doesnt need an incredible boost and that highsec needs a significant nerf to combat mission rewardsi dont believe the best answer is to remove content l4s moved to lowsec from the folks that will never leave highsec id hate it if ccp removed all the mission runners from lowsec i believe a very good tool to accomplish both a buff of lowsec and a nerf of highsec missions can be found described and debated here autobalancing missionsnice to see that the csm rep talking about this and doing so with what appears to be an open mind is the one that i feared would have the most closed mind to addressing the current imbalance between highsec and lowsecsignedardproud lowsec dweller since my rookie days
have lost ship to the exact thing you explain but did get reimbursed mine may have been due to the fact that i was in the station still targeted and receiving damage 9 au away and just took a quick screeny b4 i went pop sorry to see you leave and really agree with you i still have 3 accts active but rarely do much more than skill change atm since lag is just ridiculous to the point even the old drive by snipe cant hardly be donescreen load times server lag and the like have slowly made the game more of an irritant than enjoyable
some time ago i petitioned and inserted bugreport that the modify order did not ask when i made an error one digit to few and gone was the thing ccp implemented that in the next patch so petitions and bugreports do help but i never got my money backi completly agree that it should not compare to the overall average but to the average buy or sell price and then warn you if the diff is too bigand that it takes the higher buy price is really stupidi mean if i offer less for a sell order i also dont pay less for it i pay the price asked or there is no deal should be the same for buy orderssignedeve gps i really like this picture with the peak in it at least you had some influence on the market
this i wish theyd just tell us what they were doing though its really annoying to try second guess whats coming next sure suprises are great blah but not when it cld mean justanother patchomg awesome patch or omfg this patch is so bad oh noes
its nice to see that such a huge amount of bugs has been fixedreally its good to see that something is happeningbut i havent seen even one fix from the usability report buglistso csm please stay with thishere two things from the dev block that make me wonderthe eve mail window can now be resized this will allow for an easier reading experience for very long mailslol long mails there are no long mails possible due to the damn character limitif they changed that this would be great but they havent mentioned it anywherethe character limit in notepad has been fixed to 3900 characters and on exceeding this limitgreat so now we have another text field with such an annoying character limitmaybe i should explain the ccp devs how to implement a dynamic string and how to save  load itevery programming student learns this in the first yeareve g
i just detected that ccp casqade has replied to the original thread see aboveso ccp now knows about it so the goal of this thread is fulfilled lets see what happens to these bugs in the future thx again to jeremey and all his russian friends to collect thisb dataregards eve g
youre doing that playing everyone for stupid thing again making those who wardec a militia corp subject to the same mechanics as anyone else engaged in fw is not creating an instance youre intentionally throwing up a redherring here jade by equating it to something that you know would have no support in evethe devs clearly and explicitly did not want fw dominated by existing alliances otherwise they would have just let them in from the git youre promoting sidestepping that to further your own ingame objectives and that given you position is a shame no two ways about it
well sure but were debating the principles of whats right and wrong here ccp could ban all pvp tomorrow because it encourages violence or some nonsense and their game would die i dont see any reason why we shouldnt have personalized word filters aside from the time and resources needed to put such a feature in because they can is hardly an argument
sticks and stones can break my bones but words will never hurt meif you are so thin skinned that you need a word filter you should probably terminate contact with your fellow human beings just in case someone somehow manages to utter a sound that terminally offends youimho demanding that certain words to be censored is the biggest bigotry of them all
no offence caused to me at least i know first hand how much lack of sleep can affect a person congratulations on the new arrival by the way i have to admit i was surprised myself when the idea appeared in the assembly hall as this isnt really an issue that directly affects a large portion of the playerbase but only a select few the csm it does indirectly affect a lot more people as it means that more of the csms business is available for scrutiny by the public meaning that any csm member who isnt pulling their weight will be seen by those who voted for them as ineffective and so not worthy for reelection if it gets really bad then in that particular case theres grounds for removal of the csm member with replacement by someone who is willing to put in the work however we must accept that a certain amount of the csms business must happen behind closed doors specifically due to the ndathe biggest hurdle that the csm will have to cross is that a large amount of the community believe that theyre just a pr stunt by ccp what needs to happen is the practical implementation of solutions to the issues presented by the csm for those solutions to be heralded as having been a direct result of csm involvement in the process with that the percention of csm as a pr stunt will fade as it becomes apparent that they are effective at dealing with matters that the community feels strongly about the voterbase need to believe that the csm can make a difference so as to encourage a larger turnout at the next election and so lend more legitimacy to the csm processa statistic that many of the detractors like to throw around is that only 11 of the playerbase cared enough about the csm to vote however there were many stories going on around the time of the election about problems with voting through the forum software getting kicked off multiple times while attempting to vote for example this process needs to be streamlined a lot more to make it easier to cast your vote perhaps by advertising the process at character login and providing a way of voting from the character selection screen without coming here and having to deal with the forums software problemsoh and just for the record im neither an alt nor an aquaintance of lavista vista my only tie to him was that he happened to be the csm i voted for as his ideas meshed a lot with my own at the time of the election
planetary interaction sub stations colonies asteroidicemoon colonyreasoni feel that the current state of things leaves much to be desired once an alliance carves out a piece of space for itself all that you can do with that space is either actively mine its belts or passively mine the moons meanwhile you have to haul bulky products from empire to fuel all the towers with this purposed idea it will add more infrastructure to an alliance serve to adequately manipulate its resources facilitate alliance selfsufficiency provide facets for pvp and also persuade more alliances to deploy stations and achieve constellation sov due to a colony requiring constellation sov leading hopefully to a more populated 00again i would like to stress that all of the below ideas can only be put into effect if the alliance obtains constellation sovspecificsthese structures can only be anchored in a system that is under constellation sov a colony consists of 2 main pieces one an orbiting module around the planet which serves as a hub and two a colony on the planet which harvests the resources you can then add asteroidicemoon colonies as deemed necessarythe orbiting hub aka sub stationthe orbiting hub will serve multiple purposes think of the hub as a sort of sub station you can anchor the sub station at any planet under the alliances constellation sov you can access resources to and from the colony at this hub you can access certain portions of the hub only if you have the roles required by the alliance you will interact with it much in the same way that you interact with a pos or perhaps one would be able to dock with it you deposit items into a resource hangar that is required for the colony to continue functioning you can also access resources that the colony produces out of another hangarinputted resources workers marines slaves tourists livestock food etc depending on planetoutputted resources enriched uranium robotics coolant mechanical parts oxygen assorted isotopes ore and ice fuel pellets if need be depending on planetyou will notice that most outputted resources are pos and capital ship fuel the benefit of this is that the required resources for a colony will be easier to import because they take up less room in a cargo hold then you take the outputted resources and fuel your towers and ships it will have to be balanced to the point so that a colony isnt vastly overpowered compared to the current form of fueling towers but enough to make it all worthwhile take the idea a stretch further and be able to upgrade a colony enough to where it is self sufficient eliminating the need to import fuel all together for example every week the colony is functioning it either decreases its fuel requirement or it actually starts producing fuel for itself aka marines slaves workersas long as constellation sov is maintained the orbiting hub will not be destroyable only the service module can be attacked much like a stations services see missions if constellation sov is lost the colony will be vacated it can then be attackeddestroyedsit there useless if it is destroyed all resources in the hubs hangars will be lost the planet colony is also destroyed and the planet will slowly revert to its pre terraformed or uninhabited state if constellation sov is regained by the alliance that deployed the colony and it had not been destroyed then it will become active againit would also be beneficial if the orbiting hub could take over the functions of a researchmanufacturing pos a player would be able to conduct researchcopyinginventionmanufactuing much in the same way you can with a pos nowcontinued
the planet colonyafter a colony is in place it will either terra form the planet to the point where it is more earth like or it will merely take advantage of the planet resources and use some sort of biodome for the colony each planet may very well have different resources ala moon mining an icy world may offer different resources than a volcanic oneanother way ambulation could happen is that only planets with regular outposts at them could have ambulation planet colonies with substations at them would merely serve to harvest the planet this would localize ambulation planets a little more and restrict their abundance to the number of systems with outposts in the constellationyou can visit the colony itself by first going to any of the stations in the sov 4 constellation and then ferrying to it after making your colony selection the ferry will basically be a jump from the station to the colony you will take nothing with you to the colony and your ship will still be in the station you were at after arriving on the planet it will take advantage of ambulation and give eve a more dynamic feel once on the planet you can walk around and interact i think it would be great if there were missions of some kind that take place solely on the planet but that is probably asking too much if constellation sov is lost at anytime and you are either logged out at or logged in at a planet colony then you will be evacuated to the station you were previously at without choice to hear about planetary bombardment read the post below thisccp stated that there will be features in ambulation but also that ambulation would only be present in a few stations in empire planetside interaction is really here to facilitate this feature to those in 00 who want it planet ambulation is not specifically needed for the rest of this planetary interaction model which i am proposingthe asteroidice colonyan asteroidice colony is an anchorable structure in space which can only be placed at a belt with a related planet colony if you have a colony at planet 5 then you can place asteroidice colonies at all of the planet v belts the asteroidice colonies will be placed at a belt and harvest any of the oresice in the belt a small flotilla of drones will be the harvesting mechanism the drones will randomly mine from any asteroidice in the belt a new ice mining drone will need to be implemented these drones will be invulnerable to npc rats but vulnerable to enemy attack if that happens then the alliance must replace the drones for harvesting to continue the oreice from the asteroidice colony will need to be manually hauled before if reaches maximum capacity and stops harvesting there will be a resource requirement for asteroidice colonies such as workers miners etc the resources required for an asteroidice colony will be added to the resource requirement of the orbiting hub that the asteroidice colony is delegated tooan asteroidice colony can be attacked at any timeif constellation sov is in effect the asteroidice colony can only be put out of operation by an attacking force which can then take off with some of the gathered resources this will halt any harvesting you can reactivate the asteroidice colony once you rep it back up or if it passively regains its shields this will give any hostile gang something to do if it cant find anyone to shoot in the area and force the alliance to defend its infrastructureif constellation sov is lost the asteroidice colony will be vacated it can then be destroyed or sit there useless if constellation sov is regained by the alliance that deployed the asteroidice colony then it will become active
the moon colonythis feature will have the ability to replace moon mining poss it will be an anchorable structure in space if an alliance has the ability to start a colony on the planet that the moon is orbiting then they have the option of tearing d
neat idea
sounds interesting i can see some problems though specifically at the moment the items that you mentioned that go into the colony  are at current hard to find i know that some people fly around with them in their cargohold just for kicks exotic dancers especially but this suggestion would require new methods of obtaining them apart from that good idea
in 1 of the first eon magazines there was a article about such thingwill later look into it tho no news ever since
nobody has anything to add
this is a great idea obviously the resources for the colony would need to be easier to obtain than they are now i could also see this tying into a lot of other great ideas on this forum
so was there a meeting this month or what i just got minny bs v done and it rocks for flying a phoon or maelstrom but should i train large proj turrett v or not

i agree with the op

taking down and setting up posses is the most tedious boring and annoying thing in the whole of eve itUFFFDs also known to cause decrease of mental capacity over timemuch support for this topic
let me expand on the idea someone mention before me that most space game has a colony ship how about we have a colony ship too that costs around 20m in mineral to build and required a tower diff tower size give diff amount slot to prefit on the ship like large tower will give 10 slot med 6 and small 3the ship has a reserved fuel bay for 1day to supply the pos and a fuel bay to hold fuel for jumping this ship is light so it has quite long jump range when lauched the ship will automaticly anchor the tower and continue to anchoronline the mod on prefit slot
burden of proofs on you to show that this change cannot be decoupled from pos spam twds already tried and failed now its your turn

i dont know what i like more tarminics idea or yamamotosspeedy space medic frigates are needed big dumb battleships with logistic abilities are needed as well even though the competition at this level are pretty impressive  the carriersbut supply vessels would be even more interesting maybe some minijumpfreighters with some slots for a slight bit of tank or speed as well as some of those long range capital tractor beams to pull in the wrecks after the fight in case the minijumpfreighters team has won it of course 
im inclinded to disagree with this ideaas a logistics boat itll fail its role due to weak remotes and low hp instead id imagine a mini blockade runner more agile at that but sans turret and perhaps slightly less cargo would be a more effective t2 use of the hull
decent idea especially with the fw limitations you mentionedor perhaps lets just implement a logistics module or 4energy transfer supplementer shield transfer supplementer remote armor repair supplementer  mid slot item 100 transferrepair amount 100 transferrepair range per logistics level only one transfer supplimenter of any type can be active per ship does not itself do anything remotely but makes remote logistics more efficientremote hull repair supplementer  low slot 30 reduction in remote hull repair cycle time level in addition to other bonusesthis will enable anyone to provide logistics without requiring the introduction of an entirely new ship type current logistic ships are able to run multiple modules simultaneously
wow its perfect this is a major one to get on the table
excellent idea
logistics bs requiring bs 5logistics 5 but with 150km rep range and a tank kthx
i believe it gives too much power to the defenders as a few people have statedi also believe it will restrict travel further and make roving pvp much more difficult small gangs and small corps will suffer while large ones will gain due to more uncertainty it would be safer to take just a little larger blob etc etc we need to move away from that not further towards itwhile i appreciate that there are a ton of great ideas posted and this initially seemed like one of them many people seem to forget that a very large portion of the player base are not hardcore eve ninjaswhile this idea would work for a small percentage of people living and working in noseclowsec it would further restrict those people who just like to dabble in pvp to make pvp more than the opportunity to get hammered you would need a gang with even more specialists than the current system this invalidates pvp for thousands of players in very small corps it also has a negative impact on newer players whos only intel is local finally this idea would probably meet with the most whining ever there would be far less targets as everyone would stay in systems they have good intel in until their probing guy came on and thus hardly ever meeting up with the enemya big no from me
i like it as long as small corps arent ed which i think you covered i do certainly like it
heres an idea  killmarksa killmark would be an item that you get when you get final blow on your target a bounty system would be created so that you can use the killmark as proof that you killed the targetpoints how it would workyou dont get killmarks unless you have accepted a kill contractaccepting the kill contract gives you like a passcard used in complexes that will be red in colour when you kill your target the item changes colour to green then you can complete the contract and collect the rewardkill contracts would maybe 7 days after accepted but if you fail to complete it the killmark like a pass card thingy like you need to open gates in complexes examples  zbikokis hacker card  rs officers passcard disappearsmultiple people can accept one contract but only 1 person will be able to complete it ie only 1 person gets the rewardyou would only be able to accept say 2 kill contracts at a timekill contracts can be accepted from anywhere and completed from anywhere enables outlaws to try it alsothe target can also shoot the bounty hunterkillmarks would not be jetisonable a killmark would be present in your cargohold all the time while the contract is accepted the killmark cannot be moved from cargohold but will automatically be present in any ship you fly whether you eject and board a new one or dock and change ship the one you are currently flying keeps the killmarkofcourse this could be done by the addition of a new tab in the character sheet killmarks would then show up in that new tab rather than as an actual item in your cargofor merc corps only directorceo can accept a kill contract on a corporationalliance the person setting up the contract can specify a minimum number of kills or duration of the war the fee for setting up the contract would cost the war bill for the specified duration and be paid automatically on acceptance of the contract if insufficient kills are obtained the corp wallet of the merc corp must pay the war fee and charges to the issuer will be refundedwhat you people think
i agree seperate wallets would make my own personal bookkeeping much more simplesigned
good idea
tie this idea in with the personal hangar divisions as well and thats one streamlined individuali mean who packs up their house in the same box or doesnt label individual boxes eh ehyes ccp and csm divisional wallets and personal hangar space asap
most definitely
as a diehard drone user i most definitely signwould said drone implants be hardwiring implants slots 610 or could we also see drone implant sets similar to snakecrystalhalo implants slots 1 to 6 including an omega implant either way would be nice i would like to see these or variants of available 135 drone andor fighter hp 135 drone andor fighter damage 135 cpu on drone modules 135 drone andor fighter velocity 135 drone andor fighter tracking 135 logistic drone effectiveness 135 ewar drone effectivenesshaving some fighter ones thrown in would be quite nice for carrier pilots especially the tracking one and yes t2factionnamed drone modules are long overdue how theyd be balanced would be out of my hands also some proper faction drones would be nice and not the augmented ones but things like the navy drones andor pirate drones gallenteserpentis would have improved hobshammersogres for examplehey a long list but might as well throw these ideas into the pot lets hope we see some of these soon  and maybe the winter expansion hint hint
dont forget drone optimal range and falloff for sentries
i very much support this idea i would love anything that boosts my little helpers one thing that puzzles me though in ccp wranglers opening statement he sas that there are so few skills for drone users well i have 16 drones skills and 72 mil sp which far out weighs any other skill set that i have but for which there are a whole host of implants availabledid i miss read this
dont forget the pirate set like the nomad or snake but dropped by rogue drone ships or expeditions that combine to increase all around drone effectiveness by 20 in all areas not just hit points and damageyeah but we shall seemy bet is jan
this is good drones are good
nvm
nerf them
i think im going to have to support though i havnt seen this just yet it sounds like a major problem i just started to play again starting to wonder if i should have waited a bit longer sounds like they need to make some kindof compromise though

i may have missed if it was mentioned already but has the difference between npc and conquerable 00 been notednpc systems provide many of the same benefits as conquerable 00 space including highend moons explorations and ratting however they also eliminate many of the drawbacks alliances cannot be effectively kicked out of living in npc 00 there are no station services to disable no sovereignty to threaten and hinder station access i see potential here to extend factional warfare into 00 where only corps and alliances with standing to a faction can use all the facilities in their space in order to remain there they must also defend the space or risk losing access to it
i endorse this product
00 is broken empire is in pretty much every way better than 00 this needs to be fixed
i believe it is possible to rebalance the riskreward ratio of lowsec and nosec without aggravating wide swaths of the member base and without destroying the established economy this would go a long way toward intriguing empire people and making the more dangerous areas more interesting for players npc 00 is probably too good or perhaps there is too much of it for what the game needs without some sort of population pressure pirate space is better than most of conquerable space with less hassle its a boring setup and it limits the scope of eves endgame all it needs is ccps support and the attention of their staff
this has lots of potential id be interested to see what ppl could do with itthink a skill of some sort should be attached

i know what you are saying and i think i agree with avoiding what you want to avoid however under the current rules fw corps are already being treated differently from normal corps  eg they cant be in an alliance whilst in the militia but the militia doesnt function like an alliance for wardecs so given that fw corps are already treated in a special way im not sure saying they shouldnt be for further proposed changes holds much water
one of my wing men proposed this solution to the nanonerf disclaimer i love my nano toysmicro warp drives are in theory supposed to be drives that produce miniature warps that propel a ship thus the name micro warp what if the simple solution to the supposed nano problem was that warp scramblers and disruptors reduced the effectiveness of those micro warp drivessay a micro warp has stabilizationcalibration points two for easy math and discussion ws points on a mwd 500 speed bonus for easy math reduces that drives effectiveness in this case one point on the offending nano ship drops the net speed boost by 50 mwd now operating at 250 when the drive is out of points the warp scrambles shut the drive off or each ws point applied to a nano ship that ships speed boost drops its speed by 50 the micro warp drive starts at 100 speed bonus 500 to base speed then as it loses efficiency due to the ws points interfering with its operation it becomes 50 effective speed bonus 250 base speed then 25 effective 125 speed bonus etc this effect would be in line with existing modules like stacking webs or sensor damps on normal ships this would increase the value of the pure interceptors like the raptor because of their ws range bonuses this is a proactive approach to the nano issues evolving combat it would preserve the hard work people have done building their nano rockets while adding an element of danger to them where they no longer have the silver bullet slug drivers complain about i think this would enhance game play for everyone while not wasting the entire speed culture taark
nctaark does have a very good pointthough my math is at the level of a pre schoolerto figure out all that lol
nice idea taark may need some adjusting but i like
i agree with this proposed idea perhaps the numbers may need to be reworked to where it is well ballenced but the idea is sound this would also lead in for warp core stabs to come back into some use as well as they could add more points to aid the micro warp drives from loosing thier speed and or being shut downas to if u would want to use them in this fashion if they did is another story
we already have modules that slow down mwding ships at ranges comparable to scramblers theyre called webifiers and the idea of putting an antimwd effect on a 24km disruptor just takes all the thought out of pvp  anyone pvping at ranges where mwds are relevantie not sniping is already assumed to be under a disruptor youre making mwds a novelty item even worse than abs are now as for 8etas comment no stabs will not come back into use for pvpthank god you might be able to run a mwd and get an actual bonus for it but youll be unable to lock a star in less than three weeks thats not a solution either

not signed  not even a littlesentry guns already do their job  ie providing a consequence for lowsec piracy  quite well as many have pointed out it takes a bs commandship hictor or specialized bchac to tank the guns many have complained that these ships can instapop a badger etc my responseof course they can they should for petes sake your badger costs 1 mil for the hull and 20mil for mods if you go all out the minimum cost of a good solo gatecamp ship is about 80100mil i could get into comparitive skill points but suffice to say that gatecamp ships also require many more sp than industrials any system which made it such that these ships couldnt kill your 120mil badger would be horribly brokenif you want to travel through lowsec in relative safety hire a scout get a transport ship or rig your ship out such that it aligns too quickly for a big nasty bs or bc to chase you down in other words invest more sp and isk  thats what the pirates have to do shouldnt you have to do the same to beat themfinally i feel that it is worth mentioning that increasing sentry dps will only make gatecamps larger fewer yes but much larger solosmall team gatecamps arent too bad for travel  they are beatable you can conceivably get a ship through them or even put together a fleet to kill themchase them off large gatecamps are souldestroying monsters against which there is little defense and almost no possibility of attack lets not create a system which encourages more of themedit  realized that there were a few other bad ideas worth slamming  focusing fire  this is an inconceivably bad idea if sentry guns focus fire on one ship until dead or departed this makes it such that one pirate in a bs or commandship can tank the guns for an entire fleet in other words it would allow a pirate blob to be composed of any ship  gank bss interceptors recons nanoships etc  provided that one of their ships the first one to get flagged was a passive drake or other similar ship if you want to make a pirates life easier vote for focused fireattacking all ships at once  this is the only decent suggestion made in this thread and the only buff to sentries i would support making sentries attack all flashing ships in range would deter blobs while leaving solosmall gang gatecamps ie gatecamps you have a chance of escaping alone if sentries have to be changed this is the way to do it
sentrys limit the role of small ships without making it impossible to fight around them they are a deterrant and work to swing the balance of small scale fights no change required
i fully support the buffing of sentry guns and scaling their damage according to sec status of system i also agree that we want to encourage more low sec fighting however low sec gate camps do not encourage more carebearsnewbs to go to low secsome people really never think things through
disagree this is bears whining nothing more the beauty of eve is the danger everywhere lose that and its a wow in space
youve got to be kidding meme gives the thumbs down
fix the problem dont tax the ships that contribute to it
no i am not kidding you by your elaborate and detailed post are you indicating that the current unlimited growth of capitals is good for this game or notthe people that have posted here constructively mostly agree on two things something must be done to promote conventional fleets over capitals its not just about titans although they are a very tangible symptom whatever is done must not increase the drudgery of living in 00 pos  other logisticsive exposed a way that i believe would work some other people posted alternatives which could be workable
i think this idea looks good on paper but would be difficult for ccp to implement without screwing things up royally after all ccp is not known for making subtle changes they tend to take the hammer down approach and then see what actually survives the change they madealso the op seems to think that alliances are deploying too many capitals and not enough standard fleets i think this is true for the most part but i think he misses the root cause the cause goes all the way back to that all time favorite lagput yourself in the position of the alliances you can only bring so many ships to a fight before the system lags to hell are you going to bring a few of the most powerful ships you have available to face your foe or most of the less powerful ones to achieve the same goali think it is really as simple as that ccp just needs to get off their collective butts and get some decently scalable servers and coding in right now they only have hardware scalability and that is minimal at best ie they can only scale the servers during dt they have no hot scalability hardware or software at all or rather i should say the hardware ccp has is ok they need more of it but its ok the real problem they have in scalability is because of the software they have ms sql server is good if you know how to use it correctly the jury is still out on that particular point but python is abysmal and was never intended for applications of this large a scalenow many people will point out that ccp has tons of harware to run its game more than any other mmo on the planet of the same size this is true unfortunately all of those other mmos shard their games while ccp remains emphatically dogmatic in their insistence to not shard eve and when you take the geometric rate at which server load increases with the greater number of people trying to use it what ccp has in computer power is a drop in the bucket from what they actually need dont get me wrong i think a nonsharded eve is the only way to go i just think ccp is not prepared has no plans to be prepared and has never been realistic about how much computer power it actually takes to keep that many people running smoothly and lag free when they are spread all over the worlduntil ccp makes some real effort to bring the hardware and software side working together of eve into the 21st century you will always be limited in the total number of ships you can realistically bring to a fight as long as alliances and the players running them are limited to the numbers they can bring they will always strive to bring the biggest badest ships they can muster hence the number of capitals in game is only going to continue on its current patheven if the op got some stiff maintenance costs put in the game on capitals i dont really think it would change anything alliances would just pay it in a effort to fill the limited fleet slots they have because of eves lack of technical scalability with the largest ship classes they could mustermy two iskps yes yes i understand completely about pre and post server lag no one has to remind me of that point there is little to nothing ccp can do about preserver lag that is absolutely true but over half of the lag i encounter is post server lag and i have the trace rts to prove it therefore there is a lot more ccp could be doing to help the situation that they are not doing
which is why i still suggest that capital ships be changed a bit from how they are now1 get rid of their inherent 99 cpu reduction to fitting ubermodule bonuses2 replace with the ability to shunt extra cpu from their supporting fleetif you want to bring a huge group of titans and carriers then you need enough cpu to support them mounting ddd and fighters and all that
why not go the other direction to solve the problem  make capitals harder to destroyhave them work in a similar manner to starbase guns as they take more damage and move through structure resists increase dramatically making them harder to finish off at the same time ship systems start to go offline making the capital less effective in combatits capacitor regenerates much slower if at allweapons or drones systems go offlinerepair modules are inoperableuntil eventually it can no longer warp or jumpthe pilot has the option to eject and save his capsule leaving the hull for the enemy to salvage or to wait and hope for a regroup so that more friendly forces can arrive and restore him after a given period of time the additional hull resistances fade and the ship can be blown up and looted as normalsalvaged or recovered hulls can only be repaired using a mix of npc components and existing capital construction components once a hull reaches this state modules are randomly destroyed in the same way as they are now
this idea is not new it has been proposed multiple times id like to discuss the benefits and downsides of it and the effects it could have on eve 1 classificationfaction warfare missions are the hardest missions might change with the upcoming patch and the ones with the highest risk to be killed by other playersmultiple gatejumps missionbeacons they yield a little more lp compared to usual lowsec missions but since the lp can be only traded for items which can be bought in highsec lp stores the profitability of this missions doesnt reflect their risk and difficulty00 missions which are often less risky due large mission hubs possibility to operate in one system not using stargates at all but pay considerably more lp and have unique items in the lp stores which make the lp much more valuable eg pirate faction implants or ships2 proposalthe idea which people had since the beginning of fw is to introduce usefull  high demanded unique items in the militia lp stores similar to the unique items of the pirate lp stores this can be for example faction implants 6 or 7 attribute implats for something like 300k lp or other things such as faction capital ship bpcs etc 3 possible effectsa the danger and difficulty of the fw missions would be reflected in the rewards to keep them balanced with highsec and 00 missionsb people would join fw in order to do this missions and be confronted with pvp fw pilots would have a chance to make some isk with what they are doing rather than having a 2nd occupation in order to finance the fw pvp lossesc pirates and pvporiented militia members would have much more targets compared to now as this missions are hardly done at all at the moment4 benefits of fw mission system for the allocation of rare itemsthe fw missions are a unique and wellbalanced system the missions cant be farmed with oversized ships eg a nighthawk cant enter lvl 3 missions a crow cant farm lvl 1 there is a high chance of being attacked mission open for everyone due beacons by equal sized ships a battelship wont gank a cruiser in a level 3 mission the missions are not hidden deep in 00 like the pirate hubs or complexes where a few people secretly farm billions a dayits a perfect system that only has to be filled with a good reward in order to bring more people into it and to animate the fw areas with new live and fun while offering a balanced in terms of risk vs reward and fair allocation system for rare goods
id be jazzed if the lp stores would just offer t1 ships in militia livery colors would be unique enough they dont have to go overboard with itdream sheet itemif they had a rd style agents  points based on rankstanding that accumulate daily that can be traded in for t1 equipment  ships to throw into the meat grinder so that a poor foot soldier can afford the war
just tried to do an auction for the first time i had a bid in there was really no notice i got outbidwould be nice if when someone outbids you an evemail is generated to inform you that youve been outbid
i never been a pirate but an idea popped into my mind which i like to sharefirst players need to become a pirate and to do this they have to get a certain security status nothing new here what is is when players are a pirate they get points for killing other players ammount of points is determed by the size of the ship and the ammount of sp the other player has these points are like lp in highsec and pirates can exchange those points for new stuff and isk with every kill they make a bounty is raised which can be claimed by othershow to claim the bounty the pirate needs to be killed and podded the body needs to be hauled back to a bounty office found in empire no body is no bounty killing a fellow pirate does not give those points but will give a security gain a good way for a player to redeem himself
so open to alt abuse it is not even funny
no the value of the points just has to be much smaller than the value of the kill
well when a bounty is collected it should go back to 0 isk this way you cant farm bounties also you need the corps to collect the bounty this means the pirate needs to upgrade hisher clone to the current spalso you arent much of a pirate if you dont have a bounty on your head
thissometimes albeit not often its useful to have groups in space  it would become another minor irritation if groups in space vanished totally
i disagree with this argument the only reason it is a problem is if you are monitoring the health of your drones during combat from my experience with capital battles the only drones you really watch are the fighters as everything else is cheep to replacei can see a use for the option to turn the sorting on and off if you are in a gallente drone ship or in a carrier that is not using fighters in your current fight
while the debate rages over the whether to nerf or not nerf nanos perhaps the answer can be found to intrduce a new ship type say t2 bc to be effective against nano ships the ship should have bonuses to small turret damage range and tracking this class of vessel may be able to suppress a nano fit vessel to 50km yet given the small turrets be next to useless against conventional ships of the line
and inties are supposed to be the only real nano ships sure go and kill them for their purpose by using small turretsits the cruisers and up that are a problem
what the op said
locking and deleting
shameless plug for my 00 agent ideato be used in conjunction with any highsec agent nerf it also wouldnt be a bad idea to tie variable quality agents with fw areas if youre losing the quality goes down winning it goes up
im what you would call a vet as in veteran yes i tell the newer guys that yes you should train learning skills first get a cruiser and medium sized weapons and drones lvl 34 so u can use them then train learning skills to basic 4 advanced 3 and the learning skill it self to lvl 4 then get a bc and t2 tanking gear and send ur weapon skills to level 34 train ur advanced learning skills to lvl 4 when this is doneat this point your learning skills are trained to a satisfactory level now you can either get t2 weapons and improve your general skills electronics drones ewar etcthis means that you progress so you dont get bored you train faster which makes you happier with the progression of your characterits not the fastest way but its the best way for someone who is new to start playing ie  they dont quit due to boredom and they dont kick themselves later for leaving it too longive worked with alot of my friends and corpmates even used evemon to draw up skill plans to help them they are happily training along deviating from the plan if for example they need more cpu to online the last launcher on thier drake theyll take a few days out for another weapon upgradeselectronics levelthe system is fine dont fix somethin that aint broken
making some people immune to pvp wont have devastating effects on the market oh no
i have no interest whatsoever in your rl circumstances  nor anyone one elses who i meet in eve0 and see no reason to make special allowences for themharrassment is one thing but an objection to harsh language please
oh lord yes
hmm didnt mean to post 
i believe it gives too much power to the defenders as a few people have statedi also believe it will restrict travel further and make roving pvp much more difficult small gangs and small corps will suffer while large ones will gain due to more uncertainty it would be safer to take just a little larger blob etc etc we need to move away from that not further towards itwhile i appreciate that there are a ton of great ideas posted and this initially seemed like one of them many people seem to forget that a very large portion of the player base are not hardcore eve ninjaswhile this idea would work for a small percentage of people living and working in noseclowsec it would further restrict those people who just like to dabble in pvp to make pvp more than the opportunity to get hammered you would need a gang with even more specialists than the current system this invalidates pvp for thousands of players in very small corps it also has a negative impact on newer players whos only intel is local finally this idea would probably meet with the most whining ever there would be far less targets as everyone would stay in systems they have good intel in until their probing guy came on and thus hardly ever meeting up with the enemya big no from me
i like it as long as small corps arent ed which i think you covered i do certainly like it
respectfully im not sure i agree pvp already has some significant rewards in facwar  its a lot more exciting interesting and adrenalinepumping than how to dodge or demolish npcs within a specific ship constraintranks are given out for people who are willing to grind plexes and flip systems killboard stats and loot are given out for people who are willing to hunt the plexerstheres a balance therei respect that battleships arent getting the use in facwar they might elsewhere  since they can get into only 25 of the plexes  but im not sure thats a bad thing eitherive been playing for two years and ive never put as much serious time and thought into the finer points of fitting a catalyst as i have in the last month nor have i carefully compared the merits of the catalyst vs the coercer the thrasher and the cormorant as i have recently tightening the restrictions on what can enter a plex forces a lot more variety in ships entering the field and dare i say it even the faction frigs have a new lease on life less battleships in plexes means a lot more fleet variety  and pvprs having to think more creatively means more fun for everyonefacwar is an excellent system and there are things that might need examination like how defense of l4 plexes requires a naked atron heh but im not sure the rank rewards are amongst them plexers get rank pvprs get killboard glory and everyone has to fly something a little less common win 
the broken mechanics are not just about battleships however hard you try to cover that up with your agendawe are trying to fine tune the rewards that fw gives to all pilots involved currently there is no incentive for pvprs other than a killmail that is sad
edit because i was tired when i first wrote this and needed to clarifypart of the issue is that factional warfare is an end game option for players just like level 4 missions are the end game option for some players corporations taking part in fw are similar to corporations in pvp alliances without all the benefits of alliance mechanics or the possible industrial corporations utilizing the space using the space you are defending pilots taking part in fw are defending space on the behalf of an npc entity and thus can not highly suggest the npc entity provide them with iskships to defend themi would like to say that yes there should be rewards for engaging in pvp on behalf of a npc entity the pilots are putting themselves and their property at risk for the good of the npc entity and deserve some reward for doing so presumably in 00 the pvpers defending industrial operations get a reward of some kindi do not think the pvp rewards should be tied directly to the militia rank the militia corporations 24th tlf stpro  fdu have objectives they have laid out complexes and missions and completing these objectives earns you standing with them and the militia rank how many ships of your fellow pod pilots you killed is not a huge concern of theirs they want you to defend their space and attack their enemies as a reward for pvping i suggest a new decoration be developed that rewards pvpers as you progress it provides an additional reward  possibly faction standing or maybe it should be militia corp standing and thus rank the progression will be slower than capturing complexesace decoration ideaa decoration option for pvp  the acefor example lets take the classic idea of the ace each nation has its aces these individuals may not be the highest ranks but they are experienced combat pilots and are decorated for their contribution to the war effort when a pilot is listed as dealing the most damage on a kill he is receives a confirmed kill if the pilot participated in but was not the main damage dealer they get 25 confirmed kill this is only against opposing militiarookie  0 combat kills the pilot has yet to be tested by his peers in combatbloodied  1 combat kill this pilot has had a taste for combat but not much more than a skirmishveteran  3 combat kills this pilot has seen combat several times or been part of a major battleace  5 combat kills this pilot has made a name for himself opposing forces should be wary when he takes to the fieldmultiple ace  for each successive set of 5 kills a pilot receives a device that is added to his ace decoration
i agree with that system dex set them to a threat level and give them maybe lps and standings but not necessarily rank upgrades or at least slower rank upgradesthis would encourage the pvpers wanting rank to also set aside some time to find and flip coins capture plexes
the kill board is not tethered to anything in game i do not get isk for my kill board standings or get the option to buy new ships it is not a reward nor a realistic means of ranking anyone and the loot while fairly valuable at times is still not in any way tied to the way i am viewed by the militia i am a part of i think that devs need to give rewards within the game for faction pvp kills by rewards either isk per ship type or and this is the more realistic one points towards ranking up i agree with dex but the only thing that bothers me is that come patch time plexers will have a bunch of new faction ships to purchase while the pvpers who are taking part in the more difficult and unpredictable and many times more dangerous combat will not have the option to receive anything
i concur rewards need to be given out for kills in fw maybe lp based on size of ship or something
this is an important point but giving the entire fleet the reward isnt fair especially if everyone is spreading out pvp kill rewards and some sort of plex sharing would help
i do agree with that however i think that scouts remote repars and ewar should not be left out of the the loop as far as gaining lp
1 could we get a link to a dev postinterviewetc to this effect if there is any regarding those with already high militia standing receiving significant lpiskship rewards based on their work to that point2 those doing faction militia missions are currently the only ones gaining lp reward and thus access to those ships but even then it takes quiet a bit of effort and collecting the loottags from the npcs in missions and plexes to get ships from the lp storemy current guess is that the lp for capturing plexes if any is implemented will not be retrograde the advantage that the high ranking characters will have is access to l4 militia missions which no one is going to run because you seriously need 35 battleships plus various support 2 ceptors maybe a few sniping hacs some destroyers etc to make it feasible plenty of characters with 000 standing with the militia corps can get access to those missions because they have 600 faction standingall that being said it would still be beneficial for the game as a whole to include possible future corp or alliance decoration system if pod v pod combat pilots could be recognized in some way in gameat this point i am going to give my support to the discussion going on because i agree that recognition for pvp performance is needed and it will hopefully close the gap between pve and pvp in fw additional ideas have lpmilitia rewards that require a mixture of achievements like contribute to 100 vp be on 5 killmails against opposing faction and 10000 lp achieving any one requirement may not take much effort depending on your play style plex roamcamp mission but achieving all 3 means you are taking part in the overall war effortalso would be cool to see decorations for corporations who show outstanding performance when it comes to supporting their faction these might include campaign ribbons for performance in various regions corp achieves  kills and gets  vp in region defense decorations corp achieves  vp and  kills defending systems of the sovereignty they are loyal to offensive decorations corp gets  vp and  kills in opposing faction systems and any others that could be come up with out of the data collecteddecorations provide an opportunity to recognize the efforts a multitude of play styles and achievements in game i suspect many players will work their butts off to get those decorations

but your working off of chaos theory with the concept of balance and game development here are some of the laws no game designer whether its one or a thousand can see the results of every piece of code and every usage of that code this is the primary principle of hacking with any complex coding there will be unexpected events and sometimes they will have no discernible reason at all the moment a game designer goes over six months without releasing new content they lose gamers as the game is believed to be stagnant and dying not that its a fact but perception is reality any time you put thousands and tens of thousands and millions of players using a game or any code and program they will push it to the very limits designers can either allow these exploits and change their viewpoint around them as what has happened with jet can mining or they can change the basic rules of the game to fix the exploit you will never please everyone as each player feels his viewpoint is the right way every changecorrectionaddition you make will face more criticism from a group of people who are generally immature pushy and secure behind a wall of anonymity you dont make players happy you just try to give them a strong productwhat your asking for because of the reasons above it doesnt work the game is what you make it you dont make the game
balance is an ongoing process forevermore to make balance easier they need to reduce the game to two objects and monitor them closely as to prevent the red item from gaining favors over the blue item now tell me youd pay for thiswhat id support here is a thumbs down option
a successful game does both at the same time  introduces new features in blocks while dynamically balancing mechanics for fair play they are quite capable of doing both simultaneously please dont prohibit their creativity
balance play pong we all know the right side controller won every game anyhow even it was unbalanced i think its a conspiracy
balance and content are worked by different teams simply increasing the size of one team provides diminishing returns even negatively affecting progress
i dont necessarily support this but you guys need to clean up your argumentst2 cruise missileslauncher operation 5standard missiles 3heavy missiles 3cruise missiles 5cruise spec 1t2 large gun type rails are ranged equivalent to cruise missilesgunnery 5sharpshooter 5small hybrid 5small rail spec 4medium hybrid 5medium rail spec 4large hybrid 5large rail spec 1so t2 rails already have more skills and higher level requirements than missiles ok now lets add another missilegun typetorpedoestorpedoes 5torpedo spec 1large blasters torps are short rangemotion prediction 5small blaster spec 4med blaster spec 4large blaster spec 1gee rather complicated to add just a second hybrid type ok now lets add another gun tree entirelyt2 lasers beam and pulsesmall lasers 5medium lasers 5large lasers 5small beam spec 4small pulse spec 4med beam spec 4med pulse spec 4large beam spec 1large pulse spec 1its a tricky argument problem is you can only argue within one gun tree and missiles dont require support skills to get t2 not to mention some of you fail to remember that weapon upgrades and adv weapon upgrades applies to both missile launchers and guns even though its in the gun treei can see how this would be a valid solution maybe tacking on some support skills as additional missile requirements to get to t2 would be fair messing with their ranks would be stupid because they are already onpar and if t2 cruisetorp require standard and heavy missiles to train then they should probably have their t2 to 4 as a prereq like gunsedit btw this is without support skills this is just to obtain fit and field the discussed weapon types when you add in support skills you open a whole new can of worms in my book
if everyone wants to have missile training time increased then missiles should obviously be buffed to compensate for the longer training timeswhat most people fail to realize is what these skills grant tech ii gunnery skills grant you a dps bonus through damage tech ii missile skills grant you a rate of fire bonus that increases your dps by 18 at level 4 it isnt really that amazing is it a 2 rate of fire bonus vs a 3 dps bonus id rather have each of my missiles do more damage then have to waste more of them to try to achieve the dps turrets are able to dish outmissiles are not the omgwtf op weapon systems people give them credit to be theyre hardly passable in pvp sans some very special circumstances and theyre only used in pve due to being able to choose your damage type and yet caldari ships are still pigeonholed into using mainly kinetic or they have a wasted bonususing missiles in pve is as fun as pulling teeth they fly so slowly that it takes forever for them to get to their targets you often waste an entire volley of missiles because they dont impact and do damage before you start to fire again and all those missiles are lost missiles tend to not always reach their target in the first place their maximum range is a joke considering that it depends on how quickly they accelerate if they accelerate slowly then normal they wont reach their maximum distanceyes missiles do damage no matter the range but the weapon systems firing rate is slow can be very unreliable as the ranges increase and have to fly to their targets to do damageturrets rate of fire is much faster their damage is instant once you get into your optimal if you know about transversal velocity youll be able to do some great dpsoverall turret systems take more skill points because theyre more complex and more rewarding while missiles generally are pve and are stressful to use despite being mostly effectivealso ever notice that almost every faction uses defender missiles not every faction uses ecm vs turrets
ok heres my take on iti have two characters one is minmatar and cannot use missiles just rocketsone is caldari and can use bothwhile it may be easier to train one single type of missile up to t2 it is not easier to train both the short and long range versions to t2for instance even if i trained up torps 5 while you trained large hybridprojlaser you would only need to plug in the two spec skills to be able to use rails and blasters or artyautos beamspulses for me to use t2 cruise missiles i would have to train cruises to 5 as wellalso i would have to train heavies hams standards and rockets independently so the facts are that it takes missile users longer to skill up to be effective also missile support skills are longer to trainthe real reason for missiles to train the way they are is because they are rarely a primary weapon system take the typhoon for instanceare you telling me that typhoon pilots should have to train up through the projectile weapon tree then train for every single missile type on top of that just so they can use t2 weapons in all slots same for gallente recons and stealth bomberstry to think beyond your little world please and allow the rest of us to enjoy eve
i think all weapons systems should be exactly the same lets just reskin hybrid turrets to look like missile launchers reskin antimatter ammo to look like cruises and have the exact same skills now everyone is happy and identical
we can be cruel to devs sometimes it can be warranted one of the reasons for this is a lack of faith whether well founded or not that ccp are actually looking at the game from the same way we dowhat id like to see is some devs sent out into the wild and then returning with a series of dev blogs detailing their experiences and how they feel the game works this facilitates more relevant and accurate debate around the shaping of the gameim well aware that devs play eve but does the forum admins experience with pirating ever get to the dev in charge of balancing ears and are all the devs working in balancing actually motsu mission runners the hope is that we all might learn somethinghow community and csm assemble a short list of corps representing all walks of eve life csm approaches corps to determine willingness to participate if the corp is happy a character is rolled up and joins the corp as a regular player character and not as a recognizable dev character to the rest of eve that is as it would be rather naive to assume everyone in said corp wouldnt know whats going ondev spends one month flying with the corpia sign off on no wrongdoing during the period character gets biomassedcsm interviews dev on his experiences possibly in the shape of a live dev blog with player submitted questionsinterview posted as dev blog including all information such as corporation flown withwe get to see how ingame play influences change devs get to see how mechanics influence play possibly from a viewpoint they wouldnt be able to otherwise
from what ive gathered over the years devs tend to be more into the pirating the large 00 alliances and the large and small scale pvpi guess the bigger question is if they have the same idea for how eve should work as we do the answer is simple even the playerbase doesnt agree with how eve should evolve the developers probably all have varying opinions toothe real problem is the fact that players get very upset when they realize that the game they love so much isnt theirs to design and build devs work for a company and as much as they love the game their own words they also market it to a very broad audience and have lots of agendas and plans that dont make sense to the average playerwhen you realize that your buying a product not contracting a service it helps it does for me at least when you buy a product the product is made and you get what you get if you dont like it you either return it or throw it outbut when you contract a service like paying a construction company to build you a house you usually have some say in how the thing your purchasing will come out we get confused with mmos because the paybymonth gives us the feeling that we are contracting which is falseyour rights as the consumer is to either pay for the game each month or not so many forget that sure you can help them test out changes you can profer ideas but itll never be your game to make and shape nor any other players only the developers and the developers bossesthe idea you posted is sincere im sure but im also positive that the guys who code this game play it alot and apparently they cover the entire range of experiences from 00 to high sec the only real advice i can give is that if it doesnt turn out how you like it dont pay for something you dont enjoy
id love to see this in
if you saw what are demos in games such quake3 you should know what ninjaholic is talking aboutit would give a great potential to fan movie makingbut ccp can consider it as a threat cause players will be able to make better movies then ccp
this would give those who wontcant use video capture softhardware a chance to create their own videos also this also allows for replays of battles people can study and thus improve their battlefield tactics uponit would also make for easier distribution of an epic fail moment of an enemy of yours at least you dont have to compress a video of it and upload it to youtube which destroys the quality and viewing pleasure you can just send the record data in an evemail or a shared upload website rapidshare and everyone can watch it in full detail on their clients
if this was posted in features and ideas why is it being discussed as an idea in an issues forum good job on the crosspost gtfo
replays from the command central in ambulation where corporations can buy more video storage than the default setting for even more isk sink
and 2x higher optimal per ship class got clue
explosion velocityjust because the missile is fast enough to catch you doesnt mean it is actually going to hurt youexplosion radiusbig nasty missiles dont hurt small cute ships muchhonestly people think
ok i take typhoon with torps will use torps on your crusier will see how much volleys will kill you i suspect around 4
okaythen i get to use a turret based battleship and see if i kill you quickerhint i will
if missiles were impossible to outrun and didnt have those variables like explosion speed and explosion radius and would agree with you sadly for us missile people these variables do exist so i cant say i agree with this kind of nerf thereforeyoure matari a little fairy i think on the eveo boards actually once told me that 1 target painter per ship in a gang using lots of long ranged guns makes nanos go away sadly missile ship gangs dont get this benefit and its still partytime for nanos on them so while missiles dont get hit by weapon disruptors they also dont get as much benefit as guns from tps it evens out
dont see any issue here optimal range of heavies from 80 km gives the target way enough time to warp off before the first missile hits not even to speak about 240km cruise missiles time before it will hit a targetmy experiences with missile in pvp is that 99 of the time the target poped before my first missile did hit it because of the instant damage of the turrets
you can start using missiles and overpowered in the same sentence which you essentially did just not in these exact words only after the missile velocities get boosted at least 3x fold until then at 80km range we are looking at 101520 seconds flight time before a missile can actually hit anything in any fight other than a fleet engagement any target would just warp off unless he or she is asleep of courseand complaining about turret optimals is just wrong a rokh can potentially fire beyond grid and beyond targeting range captldr versionno support for this issue
guns are affected by the targets transversal velocity so if the enemy is flying from u away or to u u can fully hit with gunsin such cases if u have big linespeed your missiles dont hitrebalance  everything have advantages and disadvantages live with
erm missiles are supposed to be different to turrets why would we want to make everything the same
its funny that you think this is a problem the further a missile has to travel the less useful it is if you were complaining about their damage at a certain range you might have an argument but as things stand you just look silly more silly than some of your other posts even
where is being a  frowned upon you really need to look into your connection youve got glitches
op is a goon who in their right mind would believe anything that comes out of his mouthon the other hand there is tons of remove jade threads all the time if he is supposed to represent the eve community then why do so many people want him out of the csm
wow i see what you mean you really do post in a way that makes people take you seriously and may i say its what ive come to expect from the majority of goonswarmwindjammer
never underestimate the power of idiocy  internet anonymity whoever was elected who wasnt the tool of xyz faction was going to get flamed by xyz faction in something akin to autonomous reflexanyway this thread needs a lock it was jokeparody thats passed its sell by date and has no relevance to the csm
no no it has relevance in the pot calling the kettle black sensethey wouldnt be goonswarm if they werent trying to ruin someone elses fun
me golfclapsgreat attempt at a smear campaign i mean what the  does it matter what a candidate does in hisher personal times inout of the game what were going to go dig a whole lot deeper and go say the player likes to have his peanutbutterandjelly sandwich with the pbj on top of the bread like a sick sick is heshe not doing his job is heshe nothing but false hope and lack of actionjade has been neither as far as ive seen though i wouldnt have voted him as firstin that respect i wouldnt have voted for any goon to be on the csm either id rather had a bod member on the csm if given a choice
i seriously hope a ed yes no shoutingvoting contest on any forum be it csm or another is never going to be a serious factor when the devs try to improve the game easiest way to ruin a good game is to give players too much power in balancing since players tend to be selfcentered shortsighted and outright ignorant some changes need to be made no matter how vocally players oppose them
meh
how would you engineer such a mission to prevent me from warping my mining fleet to that asteroid belt and mining it dry before planting the beacon and completing the missionwould the mission reward be more valuable than the entire contents of that beltwould the agent have new code written in order to allow verifying that the belt does in fact still contain the spawned number of asteroids
well you could do that i guess an interesting variant in that case would be to make it a decent non isk payout given that its a storyline mission for example faction mining gearimplants then the agent could give the same mission out to other people with the stipulation that only the first active beacon would gain the mission rewards there may even be a trigger on the reward timer so that you only have a limited time to drop the beacon from when you locate the beltthus its in your own best interests to drop the beacon as soon as you find the belt as other people will be looking for the belt as well and might be able to steal the prize from you by dropping their beacon firstof course if it proves to be to complex to code the mission in such a way you could have a dead beacon at the belt which automatically reactivates when a ship warps to it it would be a struggle to find an in game reason for the beacon to already be there though perhaps an ancient beacon on standby with a proximity sensor from when the belt was initially found centuries ago before the collapse of the eve gate
i had another thought that would really help the dedicated explorer shipgive the ship the ability to select how far to make a jump up to a max of say 35 au this way we could get proper probe coverage on all planets make it to where it only works by jumping from a planet and also have it require an advanced skill call it controlled warp gives 1 au per level of jump per level of skill ship specific this would really add to the the explorer career path and the ship capabilities then if they added more things to do in and exploration sites would would be really having fun stories that lead us to other sites that require a key to even find them from a previous site anything to spice things up why do only unknowns have escalation triggers lets give more reason to be an explorer 
how does the old american saying go i may disagree with your opinions however i will fight to the death for your right to express them thats not it word for word but it is something similiarthis has been debated over and over and over what it comes down to is personal responsibility if you dont like the tv show turn it off you dont have to listen to something you dont want to there is an ignore feature for a reasonyes i find most bigotry distasteful but i would not in any point in time desire to control how people think or feel or even what i believe they should be allowed to say that brings the question who would even decide what would be allowed what if what i think should be allowed is not what you think or vice versa who is right you or iif your brother is gay so what how does that make him any different from me that requires me to treat him special you have a black girlfriend does that mean you are any more special than me why cant i have special treatmenti assume that even though some of my post is a bit sarcastic that you get the idea forcing people to think or speak how you want them to does nothing but turn you into the same kind of personpeople that many races religions genders and so on have been fighting against for centuries
i hate learning skills tbh i have v in all basic and iv in all advanced also 4s in most of the time yet those ivs bug me i want to waste the two months training them despite the fact that i know they will not repay the time spent inside two or three years argh also i think level v skills take too long but i dont think that can really be changed nowinstant 10 to all characters and refunded points spent on learning to spend on whatever we want would be a dream come true of course this will never happen a man can dream though a man can dream
thisi dont care which way it is but it should be consistent
latest dev blog augh my god nozh makes zulupark look goodthe current comments thread is at ninety seven pages after three days the against thread in assembly hall is at 30 pages represent the community opinionin most reasonable and knowledgeable peoples opinions the only needed nerfs are bringing polycarbons in line with the other rigs or the module equivalents and perhaps some minor weakening of pirate implants or skirmish links in any case even if more substantial changes are thought to be required by ccp this is totally the wrong way to do them make small changes then assess their impact changing so much at once is a total nightmare for balance and is asking for truly legendary bugsthe proposed changes in their current form willcompletely screw over minmatarheavily damage gallente blaster boats cant get or stay in rangemassively indirectly boost caldari missile boats as their missiles will hit almost everythingand finally leave amarr largely unaffected in their bugged locusrigged battleships destroying everything within sight the game will turn into who has the largest blob with ecm as the one remaining wildcardsub bs t2 ships will become largely uslessplease get on at anyone in ccp that you can to drastically scale back or scrap these changes we the real pvpers will love you forever you will be the jfk of eve d
the latest csm meeting on august 3 has this as no1 to meetdiscuss about go lookalso redundant post 5 mins of looking at page 2 and 3 for it would have sufficed heck its still on page 1
sorry madam please add reasons to your assertions of consequence you aint a prophet
alright i was venting a bit i have made several posts in the devblog discussion thread about why the changes are overdone
i dont believe what the devs decide to test on the test server should be open to the senates issue listespecially whenattention the modifications discussed below are all subject to change based on player input and testing experienceis the very first sentence in the devblog i think jade is just going to further embarrass himself when he brings up the subject with ccp and ccps response isattention the modifications discussed below are all subject to change based on player input and testing experience
good thing there is a 110page thread of players input categorically stating do not want then isnt there
no that thread isnt feedback cause most of those posts were posted before the changes went to sisi and against isnt useful feedbackccp will be looking at this thread for usable feedback as they shouldthe speed rebalance has many different things rolled into itship class speed adjustment which is mostly a universal frigate speedmassagility buff and some cruiser and above speed nerfgeneral speedmassagility module nerf to slow down max speeds universallymixing up tactics with the retinkering of webbers scramblers mwds and absif you think for a second that all of this will be scrapped well i think youd be mistakenif you think the csm is going to provide ccp with anything more useful than the info that is already being given by sisi testers then i think you are mistakenjade intends to use the thread he linked as evidence that 00 sov should be fixed before speed is addressed which from what ive seen very few people share that concernfor most eve players things like speed tanks and ddds are much more important than pos shot mechanics especially now with fw more and more players are getting into pvp and fw doesnt even involve the same type of sov but speed tanks and untrackable nanotanking are major concerns
if all that ccpcsm ever comes up with is ship balancing then im going to get bored with this game before next year rolls around tbh if you dont like a ship dont fly it i would love to see much larger ship selections and yes you will have a few that are horribly underpowered and a few that are overpowered but im sure someone will come up with a way to make the underpowered ship usefull underpowered and overpowered is just a matter of individual perception anyway i would love to see being able to choose between 5 hacs or 7 bs and more diversified ship classes maybe throw in some fun stuff like mine layers and interesting stuff like thati think fussing with balance is futile really balance should create itself period its damn near impossible to make all sides happy especially when there are always 4 or more sides to everything i think it was excellently put about the eft warrior part yes your dps number may be higher than my tank number but that doesnt mean that some other factor such as capacitor or even transversal wont play a role on how our fight goes eve never was never has ben a game of my numbers are better it truly is about strategy placement and who shoots first sometimes even shoots last constantly rebalancing ships makes it more of a number game and less of a tactic game if it becomes i can beat you because my numbers are better then im quitting because there are so many strategies to avoid this if hac x and hac y are perfectly balanced then tactics are pointless yes they will decide who wins but if hac x is less powerfull than hac y its a lot more fun to pvp in one of those because its more of a challengelike the ferox for instance everyone tells me a horrible ship but i saw one the other day that took on 2 deimos and clearly had them beat just because he tanked hard enough to stay alive just long enough take one of them out of the fight its this kind of pvp that most people crave myself included sorry for my longwinded repeating monolouge
this wouldnt be a problem if csm had sufficient forum tools and control to better organize thingsthis is generally why i suggested the whole tabled  prioritized  scheduled  addressed organization for sure there are bigger fish to fry than the ferox not having enough pg and if you had the organization that you should have you could table the issue give it a very low priority and deal with the bigger issues firstmaking a council for different facets of the game wouldnt be anymore productive than having many csm teams having many more meetings
what do you suggestedit as in what kind of modules creative names maybe you have a really good idea but your op is too vague to get any response
im thinking along the lines of something like defender missiles but a mid slot item tracking disruptors affect all guns correct so maybe something that will affect 50 dunnojust a number of missiles fired at you and for the drones something that knocks their targeting lock off but is not affected by ships with bonuses to jamming and only affects drones within xxxx meters of you less than 10000im horrible with names
problem is that these arent analogous to tracking disruptors td affect an enemy ship while your proposals affect everything hitting your ship i see where youre going now though and these may workballistic counter measures  xx increase in factor of signature radius of missiles fired at this ship opposite of guided missile precision skill would be effective against heavy missiles fired at a frigate but really wouldnt have much effect on light missiles hitting bs for example makes missiles sometimes miss the ships they were intended to hit could be chance based for all missiles that hit your ship 100 or 0 effectivedrone disruption burst  similar to ecm burst disables the offensive capabilities of all drones hostile and freindly for 20s can still fly around and can be controlled by their owners but cant fire weapons use ewar repair etc
thats exactly what i was thinking about maybe not as long on the drones but other than thatyouve got itthanks for putting it down better than i could
think missles have been nerfed enough
have you know a caracal or moa to be refferd to as a dps ship while the thorax and rupture arethats the advantage you pay for carcals arent useful for anything
the reason for this disbalance is that turrets are racial guns while missiles can be used by three other races too similar with droneshaving missiles and drones same concept as guns would require too long training times to fly the ships to their full potential
ok bumpeven if new proposed changes to warp scrams go trough that isnt a sufficient thing for gallente recons and eas idea of sensor damps is to force enemy ships to close range where ideally your blasterships eat them alive problem is that you can hardly push a unboosted bs under 20km web range new scram rangeand that optimal plus falloff on damps is insufficient to say bad things to sniper bses in fleet fights ecms have crazy range and will screw you up if they succeed damps cant even compete in long range ewarimho at least optimall plus falloff of damps should be increased and maybe a minor damp strenght boost per recon or eas skill levelif they have to balance it reduce normal tank and gank on these shipsedit damps should get range increase period but while eas and cov op recon could use a damp strenght if balance is in order perhups force recon could keep current damp strenght or stg

supported boost minmatar ffs
so just started my path to training minmatar caps and i have to whole heartedly agree with the op a cap ship should not be compared to roaming gang ships they are for the most part stationary so all that matters is dps and tank this is making me second guess if i should train for matar caps if i have to do a hell of a lot of training just to be told i will be primaried and killed first and i am not exactly swimming in isk

against the constant nerfs are getting absurd the number of unintended changes incurred by altering so many game mechanics at once will be staggeringyou say you want to reduce the ludicrous speeds on some ships but have really implimented massive changes in speed and accelleration to every ship

plz plz plz plz dont nerf nanos there are plenty of ways to stop nano fleets if people use there heads so there is no need to change it
the nerf is to harsh and to much of a change to the way pvp works a change as big as this can completely break pvp as we currently know it and that isnt a good thing

i for one am really dissapointed with ccp on this matter i fly a multitude of ships nano being my ship of choice it has taken me and im sure the rest of you a great deal of time to skill in this area we pay good money to play eve and the way i see it this game is geared up for the bears in eve ccp do yourselfs a favor and leave nano alone so yes i am 100 against the nerfone last thing i can see ccp loosing many pilots if this nerf is bought into affect why are you fixing something that is not broken wake up

im disappointed with this kneejerk reaction i find it interesting that when people complain about nanos being overpowered and start telling their hard luck stories of encountering them the last thing they want to hear is constructive suggestions on how to setup or what to do to avoid a repeat they seem to have accepted the party line that nanos are overpowered and need to be changed and wont consider that perhaps they also could adaptthe big blobfests are not fun i fly them when i have to out of a feeling of duty to the team the small fast gangs are fun and dont take such solid massive blocks of time please leave some variety in the game ccp so that small gang pvp is still an option
in its current form im against the nerf and until they sort it out i wont support it and no i dont fly any nano ships because i cant afford them
nano nerf will kill all small scale pvp
nano setups unquestionably need rebalancing its also quite telling to see the section of the player base most vocal in their moral outrage  nano should no longer be the iwin button it is atm but these changes are too much ccp
well i guess this means that we should all start roaming around in slow ass battleships taking 5 minutes to get through a system meaning going 10 jumps there and 10 jumps back will take 2 hrsoh btw i support this thread if you must keep nerfing stuff then please dont do to speedy ships what you did to the pilgrim give the ships that are meant to be fast a boost so they stay fast

wrong the csms just have a way of seeing how many accounts accually voted and not charactersthere is nothing that limits the number of characters you sign in this thread with since there are 3 characters per account it is perfectly feasable for there to only be 13 pages of actual votes against this nerf judging from the ammount of alts ive spotted where 3 people in a row look the exact same or 23 in a row have the same name with different spellings ild say this thread actually only has around 20 somthing pages of actual votes

of course thats going to be exactly the same for the pro nerf thread as well so its something of a null argument
no speed nerf pls
i only voted once their jade though i dont agree with some of the parts of the nerf the dev mentioned i agree a change needs to be made
i am not against a reduction in the effectiveness of nano ships  for the longest time i did my best to make do without a nano ship in small gang pvp and was quickly educated in just how impossible they were to do withoutthere are counters to nano yes  but they are particularly resource intensive in terms of specific skills modules and ships  much more so nanoing  they only lead down the slippery slope towards blobsville which is not a place i want to gowhat is needed isnt a broad nerf of everything nano what is needed is a balanced consideration of what the problems are with the tracking explosion radius system etc as well as the more extreme ends of the nano scale and a proper rebalancingperhaps consider modules like webification fields or remote area webs just as there are remote area ecm modsi support the principle of the thing  ridiculous speeds need to be brought back into line or weapons need to be properly worked out so that they still have some effect at speeds but not the scale of the proposed nerfs so i vote against

which bears the question are all players being equally represented by thisand the other thread or is this threads success contributed to the people with the most to lose stomping their feet and throwing a fit in an attempt at retaining a gameplay advantage that is largely considered extremely unbalancedhas there been any proposals to require player voting at login it seems to me like at this point thats a very valid way of determining what everyone thinks not just those that troll the forums from work and those that stand the most to lose

i am for some sort of nano nerf ships exceeding the speed of assault missiles floating out of range after being dualtripple webbed or doing 12000ms is lame and brokenhacs were meant to be tier 2 afs the speed thing just sort of happened as far as i can tell guerilla warfare is important to the fun aspect of eve we cant afford to lose that but guerillas dont come through 20 armed soldiers ie gate camps to get there they sneak in the back way using other routes black ops etc hacs should not survive a huge gate camp as someone tried to argue hacs should not move at 12000ms either a dual or tripple webbed hac should not still be outrunning assault missiles that needs to be fixednerfing the hac to the point where a 300mill ship dies to a couple of drakes is wrong however its armortank should be able to get it out before there is much risk of deathin favor of nerf but only if done well

i would like to add my two cents to the proposed changes to manufacturing of t1 items in my opinion the proposed changes would over complicate the game and take the fun out of it i say leave t1 production alone i dont want to feel like im back at work instead of playing a game in my opinion t2 production is overly complicated to the point where i just buy the t2 items off the market just to let you know im really big into mining and i do make some items in the game i dont want to have to train up skills just so that i can make the same item i did before i have so many other things that need to be trained as it is no need to put in skill training time sinks ccp if you make t1 production as nebulous and complicated as you have with t2 production you will have made things too complicated for new players and for some of us nonhardcore industrial players who dont want to spend hours at a time trying to figure out how to build something out of components you will have alienated us as wellthink long and hard how you plan to make industry more interesting i have no qualms with adding a variable into the mix to make modified items but you should not touch the existing method to building items over the course of time the game itself has gone from a simple premise to being overly complicated in some respects that its beginning to force even industrial players to concentrate on just one industrial aspect of the game complicating things to pander to the elite gamers is not a wise decision and could possibly cost you in terms of subscription numbers later on down the road keep the game fun for the most part us casual gamers dont want to need a degree in engineering just to play the game
the introduction of new skills to enable us to use t1 blueprints will unduely limit new players and be a very solid kick in the teeth to existing industrial characters when they suddenly find they cannot use 70 of their bposthis is a very bad ideawhycrafting in eve is already annoyingly complex now you want to introduce more items and techniques into the crafting mechanic to create things that are already in the game have been for years and functioning just fineif its a rig thats attached to a specific ship then its not a rig its just another ship bonus as we already possess unless youre suggesting that this rig is put into the manufacturing process and built into the shipconversely why not have all ships recieve their bonuses as a control module that is manufactured with each ship but can then be removed the control module has its own db entry thus removing the bonuses from the ship it can then be plugged into any other ship and transfer the bonsues from the first ship to the secondthese would be the bonuses not basic ship details such as base drone bay size mass inertia or whathaveyou it might give the new ship drone damage or increased velocity or whathaveyou added to the new vessels basic statsnew skills yet more and more new skills i would have to say no please no new skills for existing contentand adding another layer of must build this and that and that and this other thing just to build a shuttle is unduely complex upon a system that is already extremely complicated
envy
setting asside the various arguments about investment or who controls prices you essentially have a class of item that unlink other nerfs kept its advantage for those who already had themthis is an oddly and to some irritatingly unique situation for eve normally when something is nerfed or removed it effects players across the board for example the recient change in torpedoes again setting asside any positive or negative comments about that change all torps were effected not just newly produced onesnow combine this with past accusations of t2 bpos improperly making into some alliances hands and you have something that really looks like dont take away the advantage of our friendsso why would some path for new t2 bpo creation be beneficial because it gives a path for the up and comers to access content that at the moment is becoming increasingly inaccessible and thus only open to a few this is already a problem with null sec resources and other things that are already monopolized by older groups and this is a pr problem so even if the mechanical benefits are low the pr benefits are significantthough perhaps bpos should take datacores as part of thier bill of materials or something to keep balance there and this would apply to all t2 bpos
easy competition if we both have to buy the parts i cant compete with the owner of a t2 bpo if i am using invention and the resulting t2 bpcs if the bpo owner never researched the bpo its 00 to my 44 costs me a lot more i spend money on the decrypters for ships or time to get the data core to try to invent a bpc i can build 10 he can build a lot more he spends some time and researches the bpo he can get it to xy and make them faster and cheaper still i can never get it past 11now someone will say that bpo may have cost billions of isk sorry it does not wash the bpo cost nothing but time and luck the lottery gave them away free that someone paid billions for the bpo does not mean they got a good deal i can go to some used car dealer and buy a classic car that runs well for a large chunk of cash and get a car that is neither a classic or even running the next day airlines buy fuel on the spot market fuel prices go up they pay more down they pay less or like southwest buy the futures and pay the agreed rate when the ticket is due if the price of fuel has gone way up like now they look smart had the bottom fallen out they look like fools if you paid a billion isk for a t2 bpo that is only worth 300000 then you are a fool if you paid 300000 for one worth 1 billion you are smartmaking more t2 bpos available via the inventionrd mechanics would make help foster competition
possible but absolutely not from bpcyou want to try to invent a t2 astarte bpo very well put together 3200 gallente starship engineering datacores 3200 mechanical engineering datacores 1 brutix bpo start invention and wait 23 months you will have the standard t2 bc chance of inventing so the inventor would be investing about 1 billion at current prices with a 25 or so chance of success a astarte bpo then would be priced at about 4 billions seem a reasonable system i would prefer a system with higher costs and time requirement but guaranteed results but this can be an acceptable alternative inventing bpo from bpc isnt
i picked up my copy us bookstores are not carrying it of jim rossignols book this gaming life travels in three cities today and was reading page 36 where he refers to quake warsUFFFD when it dawned on me that eve is missing something it needsthe hardcore cadre of eve players who live and die in 00 are feeling their needs unmet in a critical area we crave the excitement of massive fleet engagements war on a grand scale however weve learned to be happy with smaller engagements often referred to as roaming ops or just purely roams weve been forced to be happy with these smaller battles because of game mechanics resulting from a hardwaresoftware infrastructure that cannot handle the large scalability requirements necessary for such massive and epic battlesthese are the stuff of legend the war defining battles consisting of thousands of ships on both sides the battles where people say i was there and it was crazy it was insane but more importantly it was fun this is one of the most incredible aspects of eve that we can put so much on the line for what we believe that we can risk so much to have those pure moments of being in the zone swathed in utter gaming fun eve needs these wars just as surely as it needs a miner sitting in solitude sucking veld from the vacuum of deep spacethe epic battles continue because they are now a necessary escalation of the warfare in eve that must be observed by all sides of the battle however they are more work than fun they have become long drawn out monotonies of screen refreshes a patchwork of lagged out clicks usually resulting in an existential departure of your character from their fleeting life as you are either dead and just dont know it yet or rather worse sucked into the wormhole of a node crash rudely sitting at a login screen unable to rejoin the battle consumed by anger knowing that your comrades in arms are dying and you are helpless to gather again and helpyouve yes you ccp created this sandbox armed it to the teeth told us to pick up the weapons and openly encouraged this escalation in warfare in eve to the point where we see battles nearly daily and weekly that dwarf the engagements of the past and yet they have become less a valuation of thrilling fun and more a required necessity of being a part of something bigger multiple titans and mothers hundreds of capital ships thousands of battleships and legion of support ships all fighting the primary enemy lag fleetingly they are given the opportunity to fight each other between the servers graces they are now as much loathed and begrudgingly attended as they should conversely be desired and sought after we want to experience these massive fellowships of destruction and redemption to define the destiny of eve and our own pilotsfix this above all else  make massive fleet battles fun again remove the lag remove the limitation of the current game mechanics from being the deciding factor in these most epic of battles let the victor be determined by the skill fortitude sheer luck and decisiveness of those whom wish to engage in this most holy pursuit of the chaos of eve warfaregive us warfare back on a massive scale and make it fun again
 what he said
nobody wants these limitations but im not what the point of this post is i mean youre basically saying hey ccp fix lag and lag generating mechanics which isnt exactly something they havent heard before good post though
i keep wondering why we all assume that ccp aint racking their brains to do just that they do play this game too you know
signed seems everything minmatar is bottom of the pile now
introduce access logging for corporate hangars and ship maintenance arrays now i know that ccp approves thievery but currently finding a thief in a 200 corp is almost impossible a thief can steal without consequences and stay hidden for years there should be some ways to find and punish him access logs will not prevent a theft but they would insure that there are consequences also thieves will be more likely to pull large scale heists instead of milking the corp which is fun to read on the forums

hey im bloody tired of being roaming around 00 and getting spotted in local chat those ratters whoever shouldnt get free intel of my presence by just watching local count currently everyone just warp out of the belts or log off when they are endangered removing local has the equal nerf to pvprs and pvers since both of them would have to relay on scan results and therefore everyone would have to work for the intel not to get it for free
so long as a windows are built into the hulls of stations and b scans are automated complete with a ping every time a new target entered scan range this would be fine otherwise i see no reason to force players to wear out their mouse buttons by hitting the scan button every two seconds whenever in space
this idea is crap
the result of this idea on the long run is a 00 even more empty that it is right now that wont give you any more targets to shoot at no support from me
the number of targets is not the point but the issue that those potential targets are not reachable currently they can just  off if they have the brain to warp out is that complitely alright with you do you think they earned the intel
dont like the idea but it gave me an idea for a new region where this nonlocal chat could be createda region where no one shows up in local till they talk in there no numbers of members in space are shown systems that cant be owned no stations no pos systems can be placedwhere the belt rats can come in frigs or in dreads  all race type rats where you can find all the riches in ores good scannable complexes so a region with high risk and reward a real wild wild west region
the only reason you know that the current ship you are about to scan down is actually a player is because you see himthem in local too have you earned that intel if local was not up you might see 1000 ravens all with different players name oh and a force shield if you have that on your scanner so you have to move around yes hit omfg new force fieldby jumping in to a system you get free intel on how many ships there are possibly ratting there and therefore can exclude sertain shipsareas where ships are and find him easier you get the same if not more intel by local scanning would be a nightmare simply because a simple sollution for them to counter your no local plan is to drop 200 frigs in space or shuttles even next to every celestial in space good luck finding anything besides people that doesnt watch local you catch anyway we do it all the time there is a few really smart and quick reacting characters out there and those you will never catch as they rat in such a way that even if you pop up right next to them they get away
issue remove peoples who wants to remove local
well it takes skills to scan for ships in belts or planets what you say about using ejected ships as beacons is already being used by many and the only way you can know wether its a killable target or just a ship at pos is to scan the directions to know if its at belts or not this tactic can be already used and many ratting alliance have set their posses up with assload of ships to make the scanning more difficult but your scanning skills matter to make sure if they are at the pos or not not the count in local the local count helps to make logical assumptions about present ships but as i said it would be hard for the pvers and pvprs both to map the situation of each solar system with out local so i would concider it a fair nerf if you are roaming same systems all over again you would get to know which of the ships in scanner are just beacons and which not at least from my experiences if i run the same route for 3rd time i already know most of the systems pos ships and i dont have to waiste my time trying to figure out if they are piloted or not it takes time to get know new places the habits of the people in the new places and alot of skill in scanning i have been practising scanning for over an year now and i do get the results of a ratting battleship within 1015 seconds most of the time then add the time it takes to warp to the target and all possible lag the final time it takes to arrive to your target is somewhere around 20 seconds minimum up to 45seconds in this time every battleship can warp out and those who didnt look at local will do it next time
genius notionmake local a recent speakers channel instead of an immediate channelthen no one has a clue who is out and about unless they happen to speak which most spies shouldnt be too chatty if they are smart
local as an intel tool is flawed its too easy its too simplified its perfect and cannot be countered and it ruins small unit warfarefights happen at gatecamps or stationcamps because there is no other way to come upon a target without being exceptionally luckylike every other point of the game gathering intel on who is in the system around you should be an active task local and map intelligence though is free and simply too powerfuli know the arguments itll ruin the game but that isnt true and even deep down you know it itll take away a cruicial tool that players are exploiting true but even i wont agree with removing the tool and not giving players some way to replace ita local scanner with ping is perfectly useful maybe powerful enough to scan your grid that way someone can get in system and warp to you and you dont have a couple minutes headstart in warping to your safespot or throwing the cloaki fully support this local is an exploit that we have been required to use for far too long i think its time ccp fixed it
also i dont believe in removing local or statistics from low and highsec systems just 00 give the players modules and anchorable objects to replace it but not nearly as allencompasing i mean why can a corporation see everything thats happening in their enemies systems from twenty jumps away just seems lazy to me
oh jesus here we go again
supported gonna need it with these changes if you actually want a rewardrisk ratio in 00 obviously you will need some sort of tool that shows you numbers in space for an area or on a delay since 00 is mostly emptyinstant free intel for anyone paying attention to a little window is not the way to go though even a 30s delay on local updating would do it
you know theres something called probes duh you can easily see if ships are stashed in a pos even better drop 100 cruisers in system ill probe them out in one scan and just collect  sell scanning  probing system would need some tweaks tho
if you want to play without local then do so simply minimize it let us know how that works out for you
needs sorting more so now speed ships that are about warping quick are going down the tubescan results  only ships with pods in xit will require you to actually do some work when rattingmining tbh if the are 2 of you one can keep an eye on the gates while the other rats hey might even require the ratters to defend themselves people will work together more ratting in teams etcanyway what its worth i am for the ideahowever think it should be a constilation channel if you have a cycle of 10mins then it makes sense the gates are recording your movements knowing you have entered and left the area recently as well as highlighting your actually in the system due to jumping through the gatethen you could introduce hacking gates knowing your hostile has recently left you can hack gate intel to know if he left via that gate or not
agreed but there needs to be some way to gather intel on star gate usage this
causing an exodus form 00 to empire may not be your goal but thats what will happen with local goneearning the intel isnt what matter tought you might say paying attention to local is earning that intel what matter is what for a ratter refreshing the scanner every 2 seconds is for too tedious to be viableim all for nerfing macrofarmers but it must be done by affecting their cloaks the delog timer or maybe the align time not local you can remove local as an intel tool when its replaced by a passive reliable proximity intel tool
i lub csoh wait nevertheless im looking forward to the day when i dont have to fly around in a freighter
we recently got war decd by a 1 man corporation obviously an alt ceo the main character would remain out of the warring corporation until the moment he had one of us cornered then would immediately log on the ceo accept the app and the guy would instantly be at war with us attack his intended target then immediately dock and leave the corporation once the fight was over in doing so completely evading the aspect of being at war where both sides can engage each other freelyi petitioned it and recieved the answer that joining and leaving the corporation is not against policy i fully understand this i have no issues with people wanting to join in on the action and joining the corporation or getting fed up with war and leaving the corporation one or the other but joining and leaving the corporation specificaly as a tactic against the enemy so that the warring targets were completely unable to engage you except when you wanted i find this to be a exploit this is on the same lines as other tactics already named exploits engaging a player with black ops and jumping out to avoid concord killing someone and managing to survive concord as well as ejecting from a ship while a noncombatant boards resulting in the engager to be concorded all are already exploits and im sure there are more on the same lines i dont know about all these tactics named exploits use the same functions using legitamate game mechanics to avoid other rules and consequences of the game its not illegal to eject or board a ship its not illegal to jump systems its not illegal to dock or cloak yet these same legitamate rules when used in a different way are exploits its not illegal to join or leave a corporation i understand that but when joining and leaving a corporation for the specific intentions of avoiding war targets until your own choosing i find is an exploiting tactic and i ask that it be officialy made a exploit or rules implemented to help prevent or aleviate such tacticslet me reiterate i have no problems with combat war and the likes i would fully support a full war with a person but the tactic of joining and leaving a warring corporation specificaly as a tactic against the enemy corporation i find discraceful and on the lines of a exploit one simple way to help eleviate this would be to include a timer in joining a corporation much like it is if you have roles within a corporation once joined roles or not you would not be able to leave the corporation for 24 hours the standard waiting period for many things to add a further penalty to this a rule could be implemented so that a player leaving a player corporation could not join another player corporation for 24 hours note moving straight from one player corp to another is not effected except to not be able to leave for 24 hours although one could simply log off and wait the 24 hours it would remove the ability to instantly join a corp engage the target and instantly leave the corp thereby being no longer at war with the corporation and avoiding the standard rules of being at war to sum things up the current ability to hunt people as a neutral join a warring corporation at your own will engage the target and instantly leave the warring corporation and be instantly nonhostile i feel is a exploiting tactic using common and legitamate rules to navigate around other rules and penalties of the gamei ask that rules are implemented to prevent such tactics from being used and  or this tactic be named a exploit thanks for the time
yep this is just dumb 24h joining or leaving delay could be added to corporationsalliances that are at war call it concord paperwork holdups
totally agree with desert viper warring corporations should have something that prevents the same players hoping back and fourth it seems like it is a way of avoiding combat as well as killing and then avoiding combat this should definatly be looked into and should be called an exploit a timer for players join and leaving corps should be instituted it would make a totally better gaming experiance and prevent players from doing such things also another scenario is that the particular person who is leaving or getting kicked out of the warring corporation gets engaged by the enemy corp in high security space now this person decided to leave the corp that is at war at the exact time he is getting engaged suddenly the enemy corp members are engaging a neutral becuase perhaps he got kicked from the corp or accepted a ready application to another one this means they get concorded now you tell me if thats fairccp needs to look into this
1 cant leave or even be kicked a corporation while in space however a application can currently be accepted while player is in space one of the key parts to this tactic 2 once engaged 15 minute agression timer against those that engaged him edit  i see what your saying michal leaving or being kicked from a corp while in space is not possible but applying to a new corp and having the app accepted while in combat with the warring corp would change the players corporation but then the 15 minute agression timer comes in those that were already engaged could continue to engage until the timer ran out those that were not already engaged i hope they have their concord warnings turned on
i am for the petitionablebannable offense as changing the corp joiningleaving rules can create problems
i totaly agree this problem could be solved so easy just by adding a 24h cooldown on joiningleaving a corpalliance in war
i agree with desert viper
i agree with you desert viper this is a total exploit
not crap i support
that is only for bastards lola 24h time out would be great and i like the name concord paperwork holdup lol
exploit i mean seriously you wait till the last second to get into the wardeccin corp and pop whoever you found on the alt then leavewheres the riskreward therei support a 24 leaveonly penalty
rofl  i find it funny how carebears first opened this tactic up by corp hopping to avoid wars and are now having it used against them for easy ganks albeit not the same people if you do remove this please also remove corp hopping to avoid wars thankyou
i support this
i have come across this similar behavior as well i believe this tactic definitely rides the fine line of an exploit as desert viper stateshere is the hypothetical situationplayerscorporation a 1 person corp hq based in high sec spacecorporation b hq based in high sec spacemember amember btactic1 corporation a declares war on corporation b now after the initial 24 hour cooloff period both corporations can attack each other without concord intervention2 corporation b member b is off mining in a belt in high sec space3 corporation a ceo logs on and accepts membership from a player so now the new player to corporation a is member a4 member a proceeds to destroy member b5 corporation b sends a squad to hunt down member a6 member a leaves corporation a so member a is no longer a wardeccd target7 corporation b has no method to retaliate against corporation a8 member a rejoins corporation a and repeats step 48 when convenientissuefrom
i hadnt thought of that before but that is actually rediculous clearly an exploit
24 hrs is too long it prevents the quick recruiting of pilots in a legitimate war what if ushrakhan minmatar rp alliance needed to quickly move lots of pilots to their alt corp in factional warfare the problem is not the application process it is the entire war declaration system no support
cant you not join or leave corporations unless youre docked if this has changed then its definitely a problemhowever leaving a corporation at war is a different story entirely i dont think its a tactic thats good for the game but recipients of a war declaration need a better way to defend themselves as obvious by the fact that they use this tactic to begin with i think that two mechanics would help this problem1 allow concord to be bribed by the recipient of the war dec only one time to delay the beginning of the war for up to a week at a significant financial cost 24 hours is generally not enough time to prepare a corporation for war unless its expecting one2 create a mechanic that allows a third party to buy in on a wardec allowing mercenaries to participate in a war without paying the declaration fee if they have the blessing of the defending corporationa little carebeary i admit but the fairest solution to the problem i can think of that will effectively discourage corphopping to avoid wars
i am behind desert viper 100000000 
yup sounds good
something really needs to be done about hopping from and within a warring corporation
actualy kazuma saruwatari its worse than that the actual guy that was doing the killing would fly around find his targets and could easily be sitting right next to them nonhostile one minute the alt ceo logs on and instantly that dude thats been sitting next to you for a couple minutes is now a war target shooting you now keep in mind this could very easily happen with any number of players so theoreticaly any dude next to you could instantly become a war target with the blink of an eye using alt scouts in empire to aide in war has always been used but thats not the issue at hand and about the joining  leaving a corporation you can have your application accepted while in space the main factor in this particular tactic is having the application to the warring corporation accepted right when your about to pounce on someone so joining a corporation can happen wether docked or undocked but leaving the corporation currently can only happen while docked even the ceo can not kick a player from a corporation while the player is in space unless hes logged off in space
got it add a step to the application process that forces pilots to be docked up to join a corporation1 pilots applies2 ceo or director accepts application and sends offer3 pilot docks in a station and accepts offer immediately joining corporationi always wondered why this wasnt the process it also allows pilots to send out multiple applications wait a week then pick the corporation they like best
fahtim meidires that used to be the case not too long ago it used to be a 3 step proces to get into a corporation exactly as you said apply accept accept offer they streamlined it not too long ago bringing it down to only two steps apply accepted
what was their rationale other than one less step any reason why it should be reimplemented
that i dont know i personaly am glad they streamlined it makes things easier although reducing steps in one area is bound to open up loopholes in another so its a balancing act one way or another
crack down on this exploit asap
i agree with above 
yar i disliked corphopping already and we in tnt recently experienced a similar incident where a wartarget quit corp on jumping through into our gatecamp hoping to get us concorded by attacking him
this is using game mechanics in a way that is not intendedthis is an exploitsolanthus lightbringerdont get madget even
easy fix make war declaration a perplayer flaga your corp gets wardecced by another corp immediately all members of your corp and theirs are flagged individually as being at warb one of your corpies jumps to escape the war no such luck he still has the war flag for the duration of this war cycle 1 week no matter where he goes or what corp he joins this flag does not transfer to the new corpc an unknown joins the corp thats at war with you is flagged as thus and this flag remains with that individual even if they jump corp as stated with b for the remaining duration of the current war cyclethis fixes many warfare loopholes
this is a fantastic idea op idea supported and props given to mister xerox for a nice addendum
this issue is such a nobrainer that i am surprised the op had to even ask for support this tactic is practically the textbook example of a clearcut exploit
the sad part is that now that this has been brought to into the light you will see this used like mad until ccp officially announces it as an exploit or resolves the issue
something needs to happen
ah what the hellsigned
its not just the greatest scandal in eve he exposed but quite probably in all western mmos history this may entitle him to some special consideration though not an outright pardon especially considering his further actionshis banning was as best as can be determined carried out before his various untoward actions were he could quite conceivably be reinstated as a token action and then be rebanned for his later actions as it stands his banning is the very worst public element of the t20 debacle ive lost more than one eve friend because they lost faith in ccp and it delayed my return to the game by about 6 months punishing whistleblowers is incredibly foolish it causes immense damage to public and internal trust and there are very good reasons the real world has laws protecting whistleblowerstbh ccp came very close to actual illegal activity defrauding a deception deliberately practiced in order to secure unfair or unlawful gain the part of the player base not receiving devfriendhelp by suggesting that everyone was on an equal footing and that in game money or other recourses were required to acquire various items thus gaining ccp money by making those player pay for their accounts longer to acquire the isk to get the itemsthis was not only hidden by ccp passively but actively when people attempted to reveal it and those actions have gone without consequencei support a general appeal system for bans i support the t20 incident receiving renewed attention specifically from the csm with ccp revealing such information as was hiddendeleted from the forums at the time to them if necessary in closed session
in the current incantation of the titan dd especially in conjunction with jump bridges and cyno jammers i do feel a change is needed i do not want the dd removed from game i only want its effect tweakedright now a dd is a solo player capable of whiping an entire fleet off the map with a button yes it is dependent on the fleet not being able to flee yes it is a very costly ship but its been shown that the value of the dd on top of all the other bonuses of a titan is a bit highsolutionchange the dd effect from damage directly to a ship to what would essentially be an astronomic em burst this would affect ship systems and potentially cause overloads in ship modules it would cripple a fleet for a limited time wo single handedly destroying said fleeteffects25000 damage racial still47000 base energy neutralized boostable with skill10 chance to cause 40 heat damage to ship modules possibly link this to a skill20 second warp recalibration for all ships effectedenergy neutralizer reasoning this would give minmitarcaldari a new role in fleet combat and diminish gallente and amarr slightly in fleet warfare it would also criple mwd effects on fleets trying to escape bubbles and would act as a good harsh effect titans could dish out cap ships in siegetriage and immune to ewar should not be affected by this or it should be heavily diminished effect to prevent titan spammingheat reasoning again a fleet crippling measure that could also aid to bring in the age of t3 modules 10 would effectively remove 15 modules average from battleships on the field i do not have issues with this working on cap fleets if it were again diminished effect say maybe 2 chance while in siegetraigewarp recalibration reasoning including the titan this would prevent ships from just instantaneously leaving the field of play if affected giving the friendly fleet a small window to warp in and being the fight at an advantage this would not prevent alignment and would basically create havoc for people trying to mwd up to the titan for a bubble
i kinda like where you are going with this  but what about racial variationalso you would either need role bonuses for certain ships or an alternative method of mitigating the effect so that ships which can currently tank a dd have some increased resistanceneeds much work but an interesting jumpoff point
maybe reduce the actual physical damage of a dd to add the racial element maybe 10k damage basekeep in mind the titans already give a bonus based on their racial element ie amarr and cap caldari and shields
interesting but i think racializing it is a solution too my first inclination is to base them off the recon ships  amarr get neut100second caldari get jam30 points all types  or perhaps bring in scripts gallente get a bubble and minmatar get a huge web90 even after the web nerf make them have a goodsized duration on them measured in minutes  which of course also requires the titans to stick around instead of running  though they should only affect those who were there when the effect started i like the idea of a fleet leading with a titan or 10 ddding and having everything else follow to lead off a fleet fight include some damage maybe but not a whole lot and let titans use siege modules to allow them to actually have the wherewithal to stand and fight and use those gun bonuses instead of being a useless target once the battle actually starts
i love to think outside the box even though i hate that phrase  my little twist to this whole topic thought is what if the titan super weapon was defensive in naturejust a thought
bump can we get an update
i didnt get the chance to fly much of recons till lately ive been putting that off for too long and one day decided it was timebut onto the things that matter i flew both arazu and lachesis they are very similar boats but require a tad different play style because of the different slot layouts when you go about fitting a boat the arazu have to look at spare cpu to fit the cloak while lachesis have to conserve pg for a plate i fly plated lachesis sue mesame goes with curse and pilgrim they are somewhat similar boats but two different play styles are required curse most ppl just throw overdrive injector nanofiber and polycarbon on if they can afford them whizz around the field while neuting the target down for the other nano ships to do the damage while with the pilgrim more adept as solo hunting and shadowing cloaking in a hostile system to prevent enemy from rattingmining it cant nano well because of the lack of rangepeople are saying that the pilgrim needs some love is because they cant nano it cant hop in on it go get some kills and get away with itim saying the pilgrim is fine ok well except the tracking disruption partif you want to nano the pilgrim buy corpum atype medium nos and neut isnt that what the devs implying spend a load of isk to get the same result is imbalance they got the range of 19km oh and youll be faster than a nanocurse coz of the 5th lowslotleave the pilgrim alone do something about the script
how do you get teh thumbs up
obviously you have never flown the pilgrim you are missing the point completely all other recon ships have similar range bonuses but the pilgrim sure you can spend extra isk to put dead space nos on them but your neuts will wont be able to reach since nos was nerfed your post is probably one of the most stupid posts that i have seen i personally love the idea of having the rangeamt bonus as one if not that then i would love to see something added to the pilgrims tank since it is supposed to fight in web range unlike any other reconstabby mcstabbins
i lol at pilgramsfix em please
pilgrim needs some love for sure
i like the cap bonus idea keeps the pilgrim in the shape it is and not changing the roles it has as a sneek up fighter good call matesigned
my view is that titans are the ultimate expression of power just look at the shape of them and should be dangerous ships worthy of fear however the doomsday is silly and has no place in eve when you consider that it ends in a moment what could have been a great battle between many players as mentioned there was an hp boost because people died too quickly which makes the addition of doomsdays a bit perplexingi dont care for the idea of changing titans into mobile stations as i think we have enough poss and stations lying around 00 and it doesnt really inspire anythingsome ideasremove the very broken doomsday device because it does not promote interesting game playreduce the range of jump bridging but preserve its personal jump range i see titans as combat ships not logistics taxisgive titans a special 5minute siege module that allows it to have greater than dreadnought dpstank with the same tracking and movement etc penalties also allow it to be remote repaired maybe with some kind of cap penalty while in siegegive them the ability to use bombs like stealth bombers but enable them to be fired to mid rangeno drones no fighters no more lag botsoverpowered underpowered crazy i dont know but it could be fun i want to see these ships on grid holding their own and not dying the second a blob looks at them but without having to fear my ship and fleet will pop in a flash when they warp in
well i wish your comrades would say the same about the nanonerf as nanos are also hard to overcome for tzarailsa it seems too hard maybe you need to help her a little
ooh nanos are bad when youre facing them but titans are perfectly fine when theyre on your team
the critical titan saturation point where they can ddd capitals isnt what people should be worried about the critical point came long ago when it became trivial to field enough titans to destroy fully tanked hics combine that with decloakandddd drivebyddd dddbeforeyouloadgrid dddbeforeafleetdecloaks cynomultipletitanstoonebsandddd the only titans that get killed are the ones that are fielded alone its almost unprecedented to kill a titan if youre fighting more than one of the damn things and the more there are the harder it gets but the more you have the easier it is to get more since theyre a wonderful logistics tool as wellits a horrendous positive feedback loop that creates a downward spiral where 00 warfare gets progressively less and less fun now removing doomsdays entirely is a massive change but what else can halt the spiralgive titans smartbomb range and damage role bonuses then remove ddgetting near a titan and hictackling it would still be damn hard but you dont have the stupidity that you have now where everything subcapital can be made totally redundant by four titans and thats a fairly low number for some alliances to field
nope my corp doesnt have any titans and except getting a ride with steve in ascn once ive never had any benefit from any titanimho titans should not be nerfed in the way the op would like iti would like to see some changesas a titan is a strategic asset ccp should try and skew  for example ccp should put incentives in place not to use titans to triple dd a roaming gang proposed solution firing a dd should cost significant isk 500 mio to 1 bio isk a number of titan pilots could still do it  for shts and giggles  but it should not be the normal thing to doi like the suggestion of using a script a 100 km radius where a dd does 50000 k damage or a 250 k radius where a dd does 10000 damage something like that alternative 1 could be combined a rolling dd would be nice you get damaged quicker than 15 secs near the center of the blast 10 sec but maybe up to 30 secs at the outskirts seeing the blast rolling towards you while you scream your ship to get into warp is coolthis could well be combined with the following the titan needs to launch its dd on a friendly so you have to get the friendly to a location where he can initiate a kind of field to which the titan pilot can release the blast the blast ball expands from the field in a rolling fashion the field protects the friendly of course there is a 23 sec delay in which the friendly has to open the field if the friendly gets jammed or killed he cant open the field a game of cat and mouse ensues what i like about this is that in a lagged out environment the use of dds to clean the field gets more difficult if your field captain gets lagged out and thinks he opens the field at the enemy location but in reality didnt make the warp titan could dd his own fleetin short bring some skill and teamwork to the dd weapon make that it isnt used frivously but can still be for s and giggles against our poor nanonerfed exceed gangs if you want to cough of up the cash to see us suffer  this requires the nerfwand not the nerfhammer

as far as i have seen most problems occur when 2 or more titans enter the field 1 ddd is survivable 2 in a row are certain death for any ship sub capital thats the reason u wont see them on there own alot so i would agree with the persons earlier titans arent support vessels in my eyes they are the ultimate destroyer of worlds its shoudl stand pround in the frontlines and lead its fleet to glory and not intended for geurilla warfare  aka lets doomsday these guys warp to a safe pos and jump out when we canmake it pointless for a fleet to have more then one on the field with removing the abality to set of multiple ddd in sequence to simply kill all in sight and move onwhy not give it command bonuses  it is the flagship isnt itletting it deploy as a stationary object with expanding shields is a great idea but should be considered more of secondary purpose like a safe place away from home without hauling in an entire pos in htat mode let it use up lo just the same as a regular pos and enlarge its shields to 10 km around it
the ability to dock with a titan is probably the most useful ability it could have and fairly feasable to pull off as well docking would work in a similar fashion to storing a ship in a pos array or a carrier hangar but when you dock your view becomes one with the titans ie you get a camera drone and can look around the vessel view the map etc as if you were driving the titan itself jumping would work like a jump portal all docked pilots would transfer with the titan and reemerge on the other side still within the titana market on the titan would be limited to an in station view of all for sale stuff within its mighty hold yes it would need a seperate hangar but its big enough yes a window seperate from the actual market perhaps a seperate database for all saleables on the titan and a query for each titan would fix things up a bitone final idea drop the doomsday and give it point defenses manageable only by docked pilots think pos defenses but in large numbers and not quite so powerful these would be special modules for high slots on a titan and each one would represent several such point defensesof course they would vary in size and power smaller for frigate popping med for cruisers etcone big fat thumb all the way up
yeah pointed that out page one
i am wondering lavistaare the changes that are allowed to be processed by the csm only changes that can work on the current game design and mechanics tech wisebecause you are trying to say it is the core design of eve that does not allow us these features well buddy think again and think hard before you answer again in an epic style fail like this oneyou would be amazed if youd actually take the time to talk to a design team about features before you reply like this you have no clue what can and cannot be done in a design guess what you only think that it cant be done simply because it goes beyond your comprehensionno this is not a troll it is me saying that you shouldnt be wrecking ones idea just because you have a lack in imagination in and do not know enough about either game design networking and coding
the devs stated that we couldnt scoop pods or transport other players because of session change issues and that was years agounless they have rewritten the core code around that then he is probably rightunless of course you have information to the contrary
i certainly hope that in ccps effort to imporves the game performance that they can begin to offload clients who are not actually on a grid to different servers so people who are in station are on a different server than those out in space in a system although they can all see the same local chat if they do that essentially the problem with pods docking up with a titan goes awayessentiallysystem a is where the titan is locatedsystem b is where the titan is going to move to soonsystem a is on server 1system b is on server 2titan dock is on server 3so when someone docks with the titan they session change to server 3 when they undock they session change to whatever server the titan resides in for clarification obviously servers will be hosting more than just a single system or outpost it would have to be fluid i think ccp is working tword this so they can have multiple servers handle the load of a single system and dynamically add and remove servers to a system in order to gain higher processing power when needed but this is just speculationso if the titan pilot session changes to a different server everyone who is inside the titan does not do a session change at all due to the fact that they are going to be communicating with the same server until they undock the only difference is now when they undock they will load server 2 which is hosting system b personally i want to marginalize the aoe weapon of the titan and change their offensive system into something more fitting with the rest of the games design generally a ship in a game is best suited to go after its own type of ship introducing a titan sized weapon system and changing the doomsday operation skill to titan weapon operation simple rename and introduce the new modules into the game then on top of this change them into things that can be deployed as a mobile outpost i think it would be neat to see a titan being used to help battleship pilots to pull out new battleships from a titan to continue fighting although in my honest opinion most of the titan problems can be addressed with pos mechanic fixes and lag handling fixes expanding on the outpost idea titans should be able to deploy they initiate an emergancy warp and then deploy in a safespot with a pos shield to protect undocking ships on top of this guns deploy out of the titan to target any hostile ships that come on grid this pos shield is run by consuming a new type of fuel which its elements only comes from 00 ice mining when the titan undeploys it keeps its shield up and emergancy warps back to where it came from cannot be tackled at this point and then the shield goes offline just as it enters warp when a titan logs out it automatically enters this outpost state if it isnt fueled it loses its outward shield and can be tackled as it undeploys the titans shield can be reinforced in which it burns 4 times the amount of fuel per hour pilots can only undock when the titan is not in warp if the titan is destroyed all assets in it are destroyed as well any clones are moved to the players corperation headquarter station any players logged out inside the titan lose their clones all jump clones in the titan are destroyed as well something along the lines of that would be pretty cool on top of all that when the titan deploys the titan pilot can get into a ship he has stored in the hanger and use it without worrying about someone stealing his titan
load balancing techniques would make the capability to move pilots around trivialit shouldnt be hard anyway pilot docks at titan throw pilot into list titan cynos out tell all pilots on list to session change donei know bane said he thought it probably not feasible and really just didnt want it to bring in more issues to the discussion but its not a hard problem for a real mobile station type asset to exist and be valuable as well as presenting some really fun opportunities for roaming around space with a mothership as a base of operations the docking behavior is a requisitenot only insanely cool but also very fun
any fans of the homeworld 2 game might remember the dreadnaught that you get later in the game it had something like a targeted ion beam as its main weapon maybe something along those lines a module that is fit to the high slot of a titan that doesnt use any fuels edit maybe some kind of ammo should be added  but takes significant cap to operateit should maybe work kinda like the nos does now or maybe have the damage depend on the targets sig radius unless its fair to have the titan able to instakill anything it gets a lock oni dont know exactly how it might work but im deffinintly in agreeance that the titan as it is now needs to changesiggy
simply put terrain effects and weather but on a cosmic scalemagnetic storms solar flares dust clouds and such having an effect on game play your scanner or probes giving crappy readings the magnetic interference from an orbiting dust cloud is your issueneed to sneak up on someone in a system wait for excited solar flare activity to mess with their sensors and you might have a chancefrom hiding nice exploration sites to expanding the dimensions of combat in eve the terrain should finally have an effect tactics system dynamics and various other variables could be added into the game to expand almost all parts of itjust and ideathanks for reading
im all for more space stuff in this space gamewhich is why i suggested storm chasers a while back
i think that tactical environments could provide a lot of opportunity to create more differentiation between size classes of shipsenvironmental effects based on a ships signature radius could be used to create situations where a frigate isnt instantly destroyed by a cruiser for example specifics would take some time to hammer out though
i can imagine a nexus cloud that is only a couple a grid big when a ship comes into this cloud his sensors are limited to about 40km max something could be right in front of him and not only can he not see it on his screen but he cant see it with the overviewstorms that do create sensor copies on the overview or affect tracking clouds where weapons are useless or that act as a naturalized webifier clouds that take you off the local channel but also prevent you from communicatingfrom flares as you have mentioned which are random occurances solar storms that can actually be tracked across systems nebula clouds which can be searched out using probeswant gurilla tactics there you go hit and run droping back into a hidden nebula cloud and effecting what appears to be a logoff system capture points within clouds that make it nearly impossible for large fleets to engage effectively inso many options course the dev team asked us some two years ago to come up with ideas for these types of things seems like all we got in return were clouds that did damage over time sad
you could also link this in with blobs sit 100 ships in the same place for too long and an ion storm will develop emcompassing the entire grid andor solar system due to all of the warp stabilisation fields interfering with each other if the ships dont move the storm just gets worse and worse over time until it starts to instapop smaller shipsit would be great to see some weather effects to be mined or chased for certain minerals or other tasty goodies while having others simply appear in space as annoyanceshere are some thoughts off the top of my headi like it
ill support this some new dynamics would be nice
cool but none of these auto kill clouds unless they move really really slow
does not want more random db calls no support
supportedid like the chance to duck into a stars corona to escape a pursuing ships sensors id further like them to take damage for flying too close to said star id call that elemental wouldnt you
allow us to do it without having to jump into them again its annoying and ive got no idea why this was removed apart from to  folk off
not an alt but i like this mans idea
yup why was this ever changed anyways
wholly agreedwhy they ever took this out makes no sense whatsoever and it was never announced in patch notes either a 100 stealth um nerf whatd it nerf anyway it was just a surprise kick in the gonands
are we discussing making mining more interesting or how to solve afk miningto make it more interesting is a good thing to make mining more active could also effect the afk miners though mining is one of the bases of eves economics and changes here could affect the prices very quickly
as has been discussed in gd earlier today members of csm are maybe impotent this is terrible if true if it is true the mental suffering that such a problem can cause would definetly cause a loss of focus on ones csm duties to solve this problem i propose that ccp give all csm delegates and alternates free viagra during their terms i think that this would cause all members of the csm to be better able to focus on the task at handof course i realise that some of our delegates are femaleon my interwebz they may elect to take the viagra or not or to pass it on to a significant other i say this cause to date there has been no studies done that prove conclusively one way or the other the effects of viagra on female psychological sexual dysfunctionsps ccp please make sure it is viagra and not cyalis that you provide to the csm since i only own stock in pfizer inc
aha
just because a single thread exists in general discussion it does not immediately mean that the proposed issues are actually real do you have any information other than forum tinfoil to suggest that the csm is actually impotent in any way you dont have that information because it doesnt existfirst of all two of the 9 csm members are female they are less likely to be incapable of bearing children and i believe that infertile would be a more appropriate term for describing their status not that the details would get in the way of forum whiningsecond of all have any developers stated anything regarding this issue due to the prevalence of alts in eve i dont think that normal forum posters are reliable sources regarding the virility of the 7 male csm members i would be willing to seriously consider this issue if someone such as ccp eris discordia or ccp saint were to comment on this issue as they are the only ones who could have reliable personal experience in this matter as far as im aware of no members of the csm are homosexual though the members of goonswarm may be suspect by certain partiesplease use your brain before going on a whinefest in the assembly hall
it took me 5 times to actually post this postbut i think this is a good idea how much does viagra go for on the black market hopefully it can give me enough to buy a fanfest ticket
hmm i knew i should have included the following emoticon at the end of my opp
that and a whole lot of hookersedit make that p0rnstars
are there icelandic p0rnstars does iceland have a  industry
i know this topic is very popular but still i would like to post my own vision of titan in this game basically i have mixed shaked and mixed again few ideas here and what i got is titan should be mobile outpost  that is good ideatitans dd is overpowered  this is truemy idea is to give titan  full stack of turret high slots  add some sort of siege module  in this state only titan can use guns and dd this siege module would also change titan into so called mobile outpost higher resistances  higher repair amount per second  fitting  docking etcthis siege mode or outpost mode would create shield around titan similar to pos shield with similar possibilities what would happen now when titan enters battlefield he must enter siege mode to use his offensive capabilities now you have true behemoth on battlefield with full rack of powerfull guns  possibility to create dd  possibility for smaller ships to hide behind the shield but this behemoth is stuck on battlefield for some amount of time siege mode or outpost mode should be much longer then standard siege mode on dreads for example an hour what about dd well titan still can use dd but once per outpost mode dd would affect all ships outside titan shield sphere now why because now you have tactics risk vs reward it would be risky to send titan into fight
bull this wont affect looting times in the leastwe can melt t1 loot into minerals and make isk out of them this way in my experience named t1 loot is not worth any more then normal t1 lootretreat to where im not going to waste my time flying around between waypoints or exiting and reentering missions because he got away this isnt wow its not like we have the ability to simply follow our targets if they run awaywhy would i want to pvp against npcs when could pvp against playerscould break all missions like level 5s are brokenno it wont work please try to think about how missions workmissions have awards based on the difficulty of the mission creating a dynamic spawn system would reward people greatly at times when they get an easy spawn and not at all when they get a difficult spawn and without having a clear idea of what the hell is coming you dont have a chance to decline the mission i dont find them soul destroying if anything i find pvp souldestroying perhaps we should change that
if theres less loot then theres less ships to fly between while lootingdepends on meta levelretreat as in theyre not there anymore because pvp loses isk whereas missions give you isklevel 5s arent broken holy  you mean that people wont be able to know exactly what theyre up against seriously how is this badoh and theres nothing wrong with sometimes having an easier spawn and sometimes having a harder spawn exploration is entirely luck based much moreso than mission running ever could beeve is a pvp game static non competitive isk faucets break the spirit of eve
lowend named t1 loot perhaps but highend named loot is often 56 times as profitable or much more than its unnamed t1 counterpart unnamed t1 webfiers and best named webifiers refine into the same minerals but the best named sells for close to 1 million isk you actually miss out on a lot of potential income if you dont look for good lootplease read the entire suggestion before responding once they retreat theyre gone you dont go around chasing them the point is that you are rewarded by preventing them from retreating by obtaining more loot and bounty while alternately you could force them to retreat and complete the mission a bit faster it gives you a decision to make  currently missions have no decisions in which the answer is anything other than obvious kill ships in order of bounty collect loot complete missionthis statement doesnt make much senseits not possible to pvp against npcsthus the player verses player part the differences between reasons for pvp and pve are large enough that you already know themif you have any specific reasons why it could break all missions let me know general statements arent very insightfulagain im not sure you read my entire proposal obviously there would be a limit so you didnt end up fighting 100 frigates or a dozen battleships and knowing exactly what is coming is one of the things that make missions boring i really dont see how this factors into anyones argument you just seem like you oppose this on the grounds that it will make your mission experience less predictable which i could see people opposing if they only ran missions to make isk quickly but i think it would be better for the overall health of the gameif you want we could make missions completely predictable just accept the mission and undock and you explode if you dont meet the minimum tankable dps your reward could just be dependant on your dps and be calculated after you spend half an hour outside the station but i want to actually create isk earning mechanics that require more thought and are more enjoyable
like mining no what you want to do is turn an already working system into some pseudopvp for your own enjoyment rather then trying to improve the missions you want them to be more frustrating and require more people
not really as you will still have the wreck to salvage and the wreck will contain 1 named item instead of 1 named and 3 t1the difference would be select and drag instead of select ctrla and drag so automatically lost
im sure youre the minority in thinking that missions wouldnt be more fun with the proposed changes mindless predictable noncompetitive isk faucets arent in the spirit of eveat least if they net as much as level 4 missionrunning doesfewer wrecks will have loot thoughyes
in spite of what you claim missions are hardly isk faucets and some missions are downright mean not getting the whole salvaging part are you
supported i cant stand missions the only reason i am supporting this is because it might make them more dynamic
nice if these changes were implemented i may actually run missions again without falling asleep on my keyboardsigned
last night i was running a level 3 mission against rogue drones  was going to be my last mission of the day as it was about half past midnight i aggroed the room with my bs and while waiting for the room to fully aggro and come to me for a nicer salvage range i drifted off asleep woke up a few minutes later to find myself sitting in the middle of a pile of scrap metal the rogue drones all smirking at me i had neglected to fully switch on my tank before the sandman cameembarassing to lose a ship capable of soloing 4s to a handful of level 3 rogue drones but perfectly illustrates the point of how dull missions can be  that catnap cost me 60 mil isk after insurance and refit an expensive few minutes of dreaming  i cant really say it was worth it 
mining is a different issue but id love for it to be more interactive as well to be honest what do you mean for my own enjoyment i think that most mission runners would like missions to be more dynamic i can only represent my own opinion to be honest but im not just trying to make things more fun for mewhy would i want to do that i spend a good chunk of my time running missions solo i want to give people options not force people to do anything its against eves general principleoh hell no that would be ridiculous  the only thing youd lose out on is the bounty i want scrambling to be optional and a tactical decision to make not a requirement and npc that is required to kill would not warp off
a lot to do to with playing till you are exhausted very little with missions i know people that have done that while part of a roaming gang i am always doubtful of the people that say i want to make mining more interesting in the science and industry forum there is a guy that with that idea want us to play han solo dodging asteroids with a mining barge mining can be made more interesting and niphur in the past has give some good suggestion beside other people but making it a joystick game of avoid the asteroid is not it i meant the target not the mission it would be interesting if the target was worth something extra not necessary straight isk could be lp standing or decent modules in the exchange to requiring special equipment or if it could be followed to capturekill him a change i would like in mission is to make them less farmable through respawn at dt while i see that sometime it can be needed to redo it accident happens keeping a mission open a week and farming it after each dt is really a broken mechanism and one of the worst imbalances in my eyes
we have all seen radical altering of the game mechanics before and i applauded ccp for the continuing endeavor to create a better more enjoyable game that being said since this kind of radical change is becoming the norm ccp needs to serve its customer base better and explore a method for characters to alter their past choices without being able to exploit that mechanic like other changes to game mechanics the ability to undo bad choices or choices that were rendered bad of no control of your own needs to be part of the evolution of eveccp needs to think about how to compensate players who have spent a lot of time training for a specific effectgame concept only to have them fundamentally altered simply saying just train something else is no longer a reasonable approach not that it ever was reasonablefor just one small example characters who have trained to use a skirmish mindlink trained for specific effects now some of those specific effects may be fundamentally changed im not attempting to discuss the utility of an agility boost vs a speed boost i simply saying that players that trained to get a speed boost did not decide to train for an agility boost khanid ship changes are another example again this has nothing to do with whether the changes make the shipsmods better or worse the point is that players made specific choices based on criteria that were changed but were not offered any recourse to change their choices this amounts to a bait and switch i believe this point can also be applied to concepts like speed tanking etcagain i dont mind an evolving game but i simply feel that if ccp is going to alter the game there needs to be a mechanic to alter your character perhaps you could train for a limited respec or something like that options would have to be explored but they need to be explored and explored in an honest and forthright manner
i dont see how you could possibly do this without either1 leading to abuse on a large scale2 requiring large amounts of manpowerwhat if something involving production was nerfed and i made an argument that all of my productionrelated skills should be changed into something else i have a very high int and memory and a low perception and willpower  by wanting my production skills changed into gunnery skills i would be effectively be unfairly gaining sp because 6 months of training in production skills could equal a year of training in gunnery skills you could have an automated system recalculate this based off of the attributes involved but this still leaves problems with skills that may have been trained before learning skillson the other hand a manual system would require gms to handle each request individually and assuming that only 5 wants to take advantage of this feature an extra twelve thousand petitions would slow things down for the rest of us considerably
i feel like being a production character now but its ok because tomorrow i can fly recons and the next day ill have fleet command vno specialization is final it requires sacrifice and involves the minor risk of changes in game mechanics
yay then i can respec shadow instead of holy for that big raid on black temple this weekendeve is supposed to represent real life to a certain degree and among those reflections is the fact that skills and abilities dont magically appear in your mind and there is no trainer in the capital cities that waves a magic wand and makes them all go away againwhen is the last time you woke up and forgot how to drive your car how to operate the machinery at work or how to tie your shoesskills dont just poof out of your head except during a bad clone copy procedure and even then the effects are random theres no calling the operator and asking for kung fu or how to pilot a titan
he has a valid point if a change is so large that it no longer resembles what it once did the skirmish might not be a good a good example if the skirmish was changed to only affect mwd or ab speed and not base speed or if rorqs bonus was changed to shield instead of mining it might be worth considering something like this fundamentally different a change that alters it only slightly i woundt support i also would prefer some idea of how to accomplish this goal before i support
i dont agree the car you drove yesterday operates in still the same way today as it will tomorrowif overnight you need a different skillset due to someone changing the rules of the game you should get the oportunity to get those skills overnight as wellcould be done on a one time change skill option in the charpannel that gets enabled after a major up from ccp some other mmos have this option build in the game so i dont see why ccp couldnt implement something similar skills are only a table in a db and it should not involve manual intervention from anyone
because eve isnt like other mmos and our skill system does not work like that of other games this will never be implemented it is a terrible idea
its the only game i know where in the middle of the party the rules get changed this suxx donkeyballs so if the rules get changed in the middle of the game i think reskilling your char without waisting time to start all over again is a justified request
i completely disagree with the intention in the title of this thread this is eve choices have consequences if you chose something that was overpowered and gets balanced latter you had your fun now figure out what is still broken and keep on traininghowever i am for a buff to the time it takes to train skills though my current plan on evemon is like 10 years long
obviously this is the first time ccp has ever decided to change the game in a way that hurt the fotm nano users should get their skills refunded because there was no precendent for fotm getting nerfednone at allexcept about once a year when a new one gets killedreally you made a choice you get consequences no different then dual mwd myrmidon gallente recon nos etc
funny thing though the game hasnt changed yet this will not be an issue once the speed nerf is adjusted after play test dont worry about respeccing yet the speed nerf will come prebuffed in the test mode before it is implemented on tranquilityrefer to first line of the devblog again
this is not the first major gameplay change nerf which has been brought into the game rendering thousands of players months of training near useless or at least completely different from why they were originally trainedstill respeccing is a bad idea for eve though the gameplay does not remain static your skills make your character and give the game that measure of permanence no other mmo really has
its not my intention to evangelize people to my point of view different people always have different opinions i would however like to make a few things about my perspective clear1 this is a proposal given a growing trend not a response to a specific issue ccp has made significant changes to facets of the game before and i doubt it will be the last time i am simply arguing that if this is to become a trend then ccp should consider options to mitigate undesirable side effects for example the khanid ship changes were rather significant and affected characters unevenly some characters were entirely unaffected while others had skilled to fly ships that effectively no longer existed2 i want to make it absolutely clear that i am not suggesting some kind of painless option to totally reset your character i expect that there would be significant but reasonable requirements for altering limited aspects of your character tbh i would be perfectly happy to see a limited option only become available in response to a major game changei really dont want to dictate how skill reclamation system would work that is for ccp to decide ill give an example below just to give some idea of scope i dont expect it to work that way its just an example of what i mean by limited3 i fully realize there would be significant difficulties to implement such a change but i doubt the are insurmountable finding an appropriate mechanic with appropriate restrictions may not be an easy task but neither is creating expanding and balancing an mmo in the first placejust one rhetorical point to some of the comments made eve is a game it should be fun and as fair as possible eve is not some kind of life simulator or replacement for real life achievements i summarily reject any argument that appeals to eve being like real life i could beat this point to death but thats is a separate discussionexampleagain this is just and example to clarify scope im not arguing for this particular method and mechanicyou want to reclaim skirmish warfare specialist you have level 5 to do so you must train a special reclamation skill and you must reclaim the entire skill ie you cannot just reclaim one level of the skill the time it will take to perform the reclamation training is based on the rank level and primarysecondary attributes of the skill being reclaimed1 the rank of the reclamation training is equal to the skill reclaimed2 the primary attributes for the reclamation skill are the same as the skill reclaimed3 the level time is one level less than the reclaimed skill in this example the total time to reclaim skirmish warfare specialist at level v would be equal to the amount of time your character would need to train a rank 5 skill based on charismawill from level 3 to level 4once you were done you would receive a bank of skill point that could be spent on any skill that had the same primary and secondary attributes dont forget you lose skirmish warfare specialist completely though it could be retrained latter if you wishobviously you could not undercut prerequisites anyway i only provide the example to show that im not talking about some wildly easy way to just remake your character i am talking about a method that would allow you to shift your characters focus within reason and at the cost of some lost training timefor example this would allow you to trade mechanical engineering v to particle physics v at the cost of some training time but it would not allow you to trade mechanical engineering v for amarr cruiser v in any way shape or form
op no just nolast sunday after having a 26er of rye and a halfbottle of red wine the night before
anyway i see that no one likes my ideaits all good ill live and ill give up on this thread after this postthat being said i have to reply to just one post it has almost nothing to do with the thread but i always get a chuckle from people who appeal to real life to justify some aspect of a game world this guy may be trolling but there are those out there who actually think along these linesso when was the last time you woke up and you car was suddenly a snowmobile the analog has happened in eve eg a turret ship suddenly becomes a missile boatwhen was the last time your body was destroyed but your neural mappings were instantly documented at the moment of your death and transported at faster than light speeds to be deposited in a clonewhen was the last time you flew in a ship with massively sophisticated computers that cant seem to do simple things like automatically lock targets without employing some kind of giant secondary computer system that is modularly interchangeable with a howitzerwhen was the last time you plugged into a skill book that taught you how to fly a space battleshipwhen was the last time you were able to remove or install 1600 millimeters of armor plating on an entire ship in the blink of an eye oh and btw that armor is modularly interchangeable with a target tracking systemwhen is the last time you were able to repair tons of armor in a few seconds using empty space and nano repair botsit is a game and things that defy the logic of real life are accepted all the time because it makes the game experience more enjoyable and fair repeat after me you are not a super cool nigh invincible spaceship pilotyou are some guy or chick who plays eve
ok one last posti find it odd that no one bats an eye at characters being bought and sold so players can gain or trade access to new shipsmods but everyone seems to think it is unacceptable for someone to be able alter his or her own character where is the logic in thatalrightseriouslyim done now
first off i do not troll i just vary my input to threads based upon the legitimacy andor the repetition of the topic this respeccing for instance has been talked about numerous times with similar rejection each timei dont think that your car has become a snowmobile however i do think there was an overnight recall on your transmission and now you have an automatic instead of a standard that doesnt mean you get to just erase how to drive a standard those skills will be with you forever now youll just have to relearn how to operate the car with an automatic insteadspaceships fittings repairs thats all game mechanics as you pointed out and given the setting 40000 years in the future entirely plausible besides its the same with any mmo some may have elves wearing armor and carrying shields this one has frigates wearing armor and carrying lasersbtw i am a super cool spaceship pilot
no
alright learning skills as they are suck the skill system in eve is nice because its flexible and youre always training towards something useful personally ill be damn happy a week from now because ill be able to use t2 medium guns i remember the same feeling when i hit electronics upgrades v and could start training for my covops working towards that next desired skill and watching as it changes your gameplay is part of what makes eve so appealingenter learning skills learning skills grind this to a halt the choice for newbies isnt hmm i do want to train to use this awesome new module or get into a destroyer or get myself connections to do level 2 missions there is no choice really theyre told that unless they spend weeks training up learning skills theyll be gimped later on as such it makes the early part of eve well ing boring yeah of course you can stagger the learning skills and not do it all at once but youre still wasting a load of time training some boring skill that only serves as a means to slow them down as they try to get into evelearning skills flat out suck and if i recall correctly ccp doesnt like them either however how do you remove them without making it unfair to vets whove trained all those skills upits pretty simple firstly remove the learning skills from the game refund all points that people have spent into learning skills and put them in a pool that can be distributed instantly to any other skill they want no sp wasted from there add 610 to all attributes for everyone to make up for the lack of learning skills
i support the ideadiscussion currently going on
you really think they are going to count the 34 of the alts voting in your speednerf threadsi really dont think they will especailyl when they actually check how many are a few days old  and if you really want votes to count then they are going to have to do a search on every character to see how old they are and if they are actually viable as a voterjust like real lifeguess your vote will fail at that point
votes are per account not per character and are automatically counted numbnuts
nobody that plays eve has alt accounts
guess what each one of those votes cost 15 usd a month so why does the pronerf have 18 and the antinerf have 40 maybe because the antinerf represents the year playerbase that have dedicated to the game invested billions in ships and implants and second accounts and because the pronerf typically is made of 3month drake and raven pilots that just joined the biggest blob alliance that would let them in ever vote is valid get over yourself
can i just remind you arlenna  that whatever changes ccp make to the game resulting from these proposed changes  the people who fly nano ships now and are engaged in pvp on a daily basis  will still be good pvpers and you will still be fly safeovelve
or maybe it is just because people are more likely to speak out if they have something to lose and find it hard to consider what is best for the game rather than their own selfish interestsi think this nerf is a needed one and i am a beta vet  so your arguement isnt all that strong is it
i think the votes against are only higher because all the nanos double as forum whiners
i see no reason to believe that one side of the debate would be using alts more than the other nanolovers and nanohaters both feel passionately about this issue and i imagine theres about the same ratio of people on both sides who will cast three votes per account instead of one thus even if the raw numbers are misleading thesupport ratios should not be of course ccp needs to fix the voting system in many ways one per account highest among them but the vote is not illegitimate just because the system is imperfect
im pretty sure this is already the case  try and support something with one character and then try and do it with an alt on that account ill try it now actually
i is be alt
well thats a little annoying

which one of you support the ninja salvagers im having trouble trying to figure this one out since everyone ive talked to seems to immediately turn carebear on me
i never really got that bit of the argument actually surely carebear would be supporting a game position where people steal other peoples stuff and because its hisec they cant actually do anything about it wasnt i supporting a position where by the carebears in the op hisec mission runners could actually shoot at ninja salvagers if they were so inclined and thereby throw down the gauntlet for a pvp confrontation why not ninja salvage some guys wrecks in a combat ship from time to time just to let them know what happens if you get tired of losing your dessy just a thought
nozh is a tool and should be fired so should whoever hired the asshat
this fix is too roughsuch work is impermissible for gamedesigner
in b4 hurr zulubird
yep people moaned they got what they wanted and tbh even though im a nano user i just think its gonna be just as fun to change the way we play the only people who will be affected are those who can only play one way
cant this topic just be locked already its pathetic
why is it pathetic looks more like folks wanting some answers is all although some could be better written 
your post just shows that you are an ingnorant whiner who doesnt understand the game or doesnt have the skill to combat nano ships i agree some speed mods needed looking into but the nerf is way over the top and is a major blow to the minnie race ive been playing eve for 4 years and i believe ccp are losing touch with what eve was intended to be the last year i have seen some absolutly stupid ideas that ccp have tried to introduce into the game and it seems as if they dont even play the same game as we do surely they must see how this will encourage blobbing and they must already know that the servers cant handle huge fightspos warfare in its current form means masses of players are needed this change will just mean that masses of players will be needing for other aspects of the game aswel people claim that roaming was just as easy before nanos but that was when there was 20k less players on the server jump bridges werent even a twinkle in the eye and cap ships werent dropped on every 5 man inty gang like today if the patch does go live the skill involved in eve will just be dumbed down so much it wont be worth playing ccp need to wake up and get some devs who actualy understand the game to start making the descions
the lot of you whiners have your tinfoil hats so securly welded on that you cant read what has actually been said in the proposed changeshere is a quick recap1 current achivable speed breaks the physics enginethats right the speeds currently obtainable are causing program level damage that means they will get corrected2 gurillia warfare thats the nano fleets or some succesful equivilant will not be removed from the gamein other words you will still be able to raid in 003 there will be a month of playtesting before anything goes liveso get on the test server and proove to ccp that the proposed changes will wreck the game take a quick breather castigate yourself for training the fotm realize that nano isnt being removed or nerfed into the stone age its being balanced a reason to fit afterburners is being added and the webscram will no longer be instant death you nano monkies should be estatic about thatthe mere fact that mwd are nearly required modules shows you the current state of afairs is broken can nano be countered sure absolutly can it be countered with a kill by nonnano only if you have a ddd all other nano counters end in the nano ships leaving unharmed unless their pilots make a critical errorthat state of afairs while livable is not balanced so tuck and roll for gods sakes if you want serious input on the nano changes you wont get them here get on the test server and see for yourselves what they will be like hell you might like itgalan
i logged onto sisi briefly earlier to test out the blaster paradox this patch will createdeimos  t2 blasterswith the mwd change the web change blasterships have no chance
really need to get some of the devs that moved over to work on emovampires back
yep that means extreme speeds though whereas the current singularity build is pretty much halfing the speed of all mwd cruisers what that actually does at the moment is bring everything into killzone for amarrian laser boats and missiles so what weve seen so far is a return to battleships online from year two of the game and an effective nerf on all small ships not just the extreme nano performance that actually did break the game physics engine its worth being informed on these things its one thing to say that its quite another to actually do it and the reality is that the current nerf on speed is pretty much removing guerrilla warfare from the game in 00 sovereignty regions this is the direct impact on removing speedbased evasion possibility before addressing broken sovereignty mechanics and fixing alternatives like black ops and distributed small gang objectives this isnt news to us and its why the csm voted 30 issues to immediate ccp consideration ahead of speed nerfingno you really cant in npc sov raiding will be hot drops of caps burn eden style cloaking gate camps cloaking recons or large rr battleship groups in player sov you can scratch the hot drops cyno jammers and largely scratch rr battleship groups since hostile jump bridge networks can instantly drop an entire regions worth of blobbers on your head while dictors hics and bubbles cut off all escape ultimately it leaves us with burn eden style cloak and gank tactics and thats about it  ravens hyenas and sabres with falcon ecm support  guess what the next hot topic will be for extra points well lets just say speed ships arent doing so well on the test server at the moment battleships are instadeath  a blob of battleshipsbc sat on a gate firing at your ship whilst it toodles away at 1500mps really id advise you to go test this for yourself on sisi actually warp a ship any ship into the ffa beacon with an active battleship group sat on the beacon and try and get away then imagine this is 00 and as well as the damage they have a hic bubble and a couple of rapiers with multiple webs perhaps you do genuinely feel that 00 sov regions should be impossible to pass if so then fair enough thats your point of view and you are welcome to it but lets not pretend this speednerf will allow roving pvp in 00 it really wontim afraid that is just simple illinformed nonsense
i never suggested it wasnt worth being informed have you heard that they are pleased with the current results and plan to go live with all changes that would be something to get up in arms about if not please keep playtesting and provide that valuable feedback it also helps to post in leiu of that feedback and not with the constant stream of oh noes 111 nano thats been the norm hereso the csm feels a change correcting a broken physics engine is less important than thirty other things how many of them are breaking aspects of the game codeso here is the question will the current status of nano break the intended sov fix if it would then i imagine a nano fix would have to come first again since we dont know what the final fix will be at this point panic is unwarented and that necisitates panic play it out offer meaningful suggestions and quit acting like they are killing your babyim not pretending anything im stating the intended results direct from ccp nozhs devblog ccp has a pretty good track record of achiving balance with broken aspects of combat nos and ecm being prime examplesits interesting that you give roughly half in one example and 1500ms in another since when is half of 75kms 15kms since in your example im jumping into the worst possible senerio alone i submit i ought to die in that senerio with a cloaked pilgrim i might not though heres an equally balanced example for you take any straw man you want and jump into my burning barn if you get out without being incenirated straw is clearly overpowered nerf strawman o really i must have been sleeping the last three years in game tell me then since im such fail how do you kill a nano ship without a nano ship or a ddd unles the nano pilot makes a catastrophic errorim waiting what aside from nano kills nano not runs it off kills itgalan
understandably people are going to be angry if speed is nerfed and people are going to be angry if it isnthowever the above statement argues against one fundamentally strong and powerful point put forth by the devblog and the devblog can be explained by logicships that use nano builds are fast decrease damage through speed and are agilenano builds are fundamentally flawed when combined with modules and rigs that make the ship faster than drones missiles and turret tracking speedsthereforeships that use nano builds are fundamentally flawed because when they are combined with modules and rigs that make the ship faster than drones missiles and turret tracking speeds they markedly decrease damage and are too agilethe problem is in the root many people say the root of this case are nanos and other modules that decrease weight by a percentage the problem is that if you affect the root you affect the entire tree every ship that uses nanosmwd or other modules will be affected yes ccp speed does need to be nerfed a bit the ships that rely on speed need a fix but if the roots are to be looked at one must look at what thatll do to the rest of the treethis proposed patch will probably be one of the biggest in terms of impact as its effects will hinder help and hamper hundreds of thousands in a very big way this time we have to get it right the first timeccp no ubernerf then eventual pump pleaseplayers quit the smacktalk and help out instead of whiningwe need to look at this carefullywe need to look at this with dedicationwe need to look at the future of eves warfareand if all comes crashing down in a conflagration of hatewe need to look at what went wrongthe future gentlemen is in our hands
all ccp need to do is reduce the bonuses ods polycarbs and snake sets give to speed doing what they plan to do doesnt just affect nano ships it will affect nearly every ship in the game its simp and does what they want to be done without screwing over close range boats in the process
maybe instead of a nerf they should introduceboost a mod drone whatever that can effectivly be used against nanoships i mean in real life you wouldntcant make a technology worse you would develop something to counter it balance game but with a forward approachjust an idea
part of the problem is the number of ways that can be used to make a ship faster it gets expensive but the bonus is clearly worth itthis part of the probelm is being solved with large changes to the various totals possible when these methods are combinedif the goal there is to bring all ships to a new maximum potential speed an alternate solution would simply be to set a maximum speed each hull can atain leave the modules and implants and whatnot alone but allow them only to take an individual hull so far the remaining slots no longer useful for nano can be fitted with modules to make the new ship more dangerous so you can get all your speed from implants and then have a tank and dammage mods in your lowsultimately nothing is set in stone and it will be playtested extensivly so if you are worried get on the test serverthe seccond problem is making the ab more useful this is partially accomplished with the 2pt scram  no mwd portion and partially accomplished with the webber nerfboth will add an interesting new adaption to speedtank ships the main complaint is that blaster boats will suddenly be helplessnearly all combat occurs within 20km small blasterboats will need to be speced for speed so they can still run down oponents they will benifit from not losing their speed totally when close to large vesselslarge blaster boats can swap that web mid slot for a targeting computer with a range script it may take more than one module but they will be able to get range if they cant be made to work consistantly then play test again will show this and we may see an adjustment to the blaster falloff rangegalan
totally supporting this would go into detail but op said it all
fw is a stain on the underwear of this game until all factions are included
even if they added all the factions to fw tomorrow the issues being raised would still exist just for more factionscharactersplayers how about you take a chill pill and stop trolling
i agree with may of the ideas here
i support this ideaif it was on the csm agend in iceland what has come of itab
absolutely yes
supported oh yeah
i know the game cannot be balanced as there is no such thing in a game such as this i am only asking that they work to correct items that are clearly broken they have added alot of features and i am suggesting that they take some time to place more emphasis on correcting a few things that are obviously broken do not ask me for exaples just look through this forum features and ideas and other relavent threads they also need to take some time to look over the games core codeing and see if there are any ways they can rewrite it to be faster and more stable
i think this is making mining much to complex changing the asteroid belts to exploration sites would be sufficient and i like the idea of a prospecting ship it would definitely be needed to provide a reliable way to find belts to mine i am not sure whether i like the idea of publishing the location of the asteroid belts as people take time to find them and do not want everyone just leeching off their work but then again it might be harder for newer players to get into mining without any exploration experience here is a post of mine in another thread that i think could provide a nice change to mining
this is why belts should never be completely relegated to exploration sites onlywhen the systems were initially surveyed they placed the beacons to make sure they could get back to the belts easier thats why theyre blantantly obvious on the overviewi dont quite think the solution to mining boredom is complicating the current process i think its adding more content on top of the existing1 mineral rich fast moving comets while it might be more profitable to chew them up with your hulk youll need an abmwd to stay in range meaning the challenge is balancing cargo space and mining efficiency with speed for pursuit2 a modification to constantly having to find belts is the idea of exhausting a location why would a belt wiped clean suddenly appear full the next day or why would a moon never run dry and collapse in on itself heavily mining a particular system could drastically alter the ecology when moons start disappearing and pos have to pick up and move on
id have to agree with this hence why i modified the idea to keep the existing belts in place like you said newbie miners do need somewhere to mine what i would do however is remove the enhanced versions of the ores from the belts and move these to exploration sites so you could go to a current belt and make a small profit off basic ores or you could go hunting for better belts using the exploration system and make a better profit thus rewarding you if youre willing to put in the effort to find these sitessounds like a really good idea more varied content is definately welcomeagreed resource depletion should definately be something that people have to be aware of hence why only a certain proportion of asteroids should respawn at each downtime as opposed to the current system where all of them respawnas to moons setting each moon to have a respawn rate as well as a current quantity for each mineral on that moon would maek things more interestingfor example moon x contains titanium and cobalt both have a maximum quantity of 24000 units and a recharge of 50 units per hour you set up a pos to mine the titanium and succeed in keeping the process running 247 with these figures you extract 100 units per hour and the mineral recharges at 50 units so net depletion of 50 units per hour you can keep this mining going for 480 hours 20 days before the moon will be depleted of that mineral you then trade over to cobalt for the next 20 days while the titanium rebuilds up to maximumthis gives meaning to the mineral abundance figure most moons have this as a factor of 1 however a moon with a factor of 2 would recharge the mineral at twice the normal rate 100 units instead of 50 units on one of these moons you could effectively mine indefinately as the depletion rate would match the recharge ratehaving said this this is a seperate idea and probably deserving of a thread of its own
1 learning is a necessary waste of timeit usually takes a person two weeks to complete learning skills in that two weeks said person will have to learn more about eve and game mechanics than he will have to in the next three or four months of his evelife why is this two weeks important its the trial by fire for allegedly new players eve is a cold world it mimics too much of the real world because pilots are allowed to scam cheat steal as long as that particular action does not involve an exploit or against the eula about 60 of new players come to eve never make it pass the trial by fire it is a good thing look at the other alternative wow2 whining is human natureyou do it i do it hesheit does it quit whining about me whining3 eve stands for evolution not the corp ughpilots in eve evolve everyday from a frigate pilot into a cruiser pilot from a cruiser pilot into a bs pilot or a specialized interdictor pilot its the core of eve that dictate the game sometimes the game reach a period of stagnant evolution slows down and we stuck with massive blob of hundreds of players cold war between two powerhouses alliance after alliance pour their resources in supercapital ships but somewhere in the galaxy in some dark corner of space one pilot come up with a tactic now widely known as nanogotry which involve small number of pilots fitting exclusive for speed for hitandrun operation deep in the enemy territories this cycle of evolution this mutation has spread most pilots adapt to this tactic some stand resilient against it most fail and whine some succeed and hold their heads highsoon nanogotry will no longer be the trendy thing to do this tactic will mutate to something else for better or for worse and the cycle of evolution continues to turnthis aint burger king you cant always have it your way
increasing the roidsizes is more then just adding more ore in them if they were to do that then prices on minerals would drop even more then they already havei have no trouble finding any roids to mine we set up our hq in a system with 12 belts and 1 ice belt and there is always roids to mine even in a hulk altho some times there isnt enough for 1 complete cycle per roid but then i just mine something else that is usefuli think you should get a fast ship equip a survey scanner and do a tour of the nearby systems and you will find plenty of belts to mine no need to go to low or nullsec either
as the title implies im quite intrigued by the timing of this nano rebalancing with the establishment of the csm we have been given the capability to raise issues and put them to the vote in the assembly hallmost people will be aware there are two threads on the nano issue one for people who support the changes and another for those againstits safe to say that those against are presently way ahead in terms of votes but does that mean that ccp will drop their plans or at least take it back to the drawing board due to the obvious opposition to the substance of the recent dev blogi guess the broader question is will the idea of the csm and a more democratic process for taking this game forward prove to have been a charade if ccp choose to ignore the obvious concerns of many players and push on with the changes regardlessfor the record i voted against the changes not because i dont think nanos need to be looked at but i do think ccp have gone way overboard this time
i was going to post to this on the subjects of invulnerability and balance but as i dont pvp and my understanding of speed tanking is not even close to 100 i will leave the field to those who know what they are talking about 
yes thats an interesting pointim the first to concede that my understanding of game mechanics is far below that of the devsafter all its their job but im also often impressed by the knowledge of our player base concerning these issues some of whose rebuttals in similar debates read like technical reports from some kind of scientific studywhat interests me more though is whether ccp are going to be true to the democratic principles of the csm and listen to the concerns of many ppl over these changes or not
frankly i dont think this is a situation that calls for democracy the point of the csm system is to bring concerns to the developers not to vote on whether to reject proposed changesit would be pretty ridiculous to run the games development on a series of proposalvetocounterproposal iterations the playerbase needs to come up with solid recommendations and specific changes to what ccp has laid out  thats what the csm was designed for unscientific polling is simply a distractioni have read plenty of great analysis from players who are actually on the test server experimenting with the proposed changes and seeing what works and what doesnt but what we need is a csm counterproposal that specifically collects and outlines the findings of the players in an effective simple and easy to read formatit doesnt matter how many supports an antinerf thread gets  that just isnt constructive and theres nothing ccp can do with that info except assume that its just the standard antinerf whine and tune it out as background noise if we expect the csm to have any impact on this particular issue it must be with highly specific and reasoned arguments not with noise
i agree theres a danger to unscientific polling as you say and im not expecting ccp to throw the whole proposal in the bin just because of the uproar that would be irresponsible im just wondering if they will take the opposition into account otherwise whats the point you cant deny that ccp are attempting to introduce at least a basic democratic principle with the csm and i applaud them for it but i also feel that its over issues like this that the whole thing will stand or fallif its function is simply as you say then the next appropriate meeting of the csm will have to raise this with the developers as a key issue if only due to the sheer number of people lining up on both sides of the argument my point really is will ccp listen to the genuine concerns that people have raised not whether votes in the assembly hall should be the deciding factor on game balancing which would be nuts
but what exactly will they raise to ccp thats more my point  right now we just have these for and against threads that do not accomplish anything by way of generating specific feedback the csm has nothing to bring to ccp at this point except the fact that many people supported an antinerf thread what good is thatthe genuine concerns cant be listened to until they are clearly and concisely expressed and that has not yet been done my point really is that the opposition cannot be taken into account until they present a clear counterproposal at present opposition to the nerf is far too vague to be worth discussing it has to coalesce into something debatable
the developers are obviously the people that will come up with the right solution to the problem of ludicrous speed in the end they are naturally in the best position to do so i wouldnt expect a player to be able to come with a counter proposal that would be as feasible as someone who is paid to do that job unless they were a developer for another mmo perhaps who happens to play eveand who could blame them but neither do i think it should be all or nothing where a dev blog is posted and everyone just has to accept it without question of course ccp are well within their rights to do this but i for one dont support those methods especially when a mechanism has been introduced that is supposedly intended to give the player base a real and meaningful input into game developmenti feel that i should clarify that i have no particular vested interest in the nano issue i have benefited from their use and also suffered at its hands even though admittedly i voted against in this particular antinerf thread i simply weighed up the pros and cons of the proposal as i saw them and made my decision thats what does interest me the vision and promise behind the csm i really hope that the council is a success as i believe a sucessful exchange between the player base and its developers which lead to real improvements in this game could act as a positive example for other mmos none of which to my knowledge have a similar institutioni feel the csm represents a unique opportunity for its representatives to raise the concerns of the player base formally to game developers then taking these concerns into account the developers can use their expertise to act on them if the csm is reduced simply to the orbit of bug hunting and proposing minor fixes i fear it will become a hollow process and wont live up to the expectations of many players who have become genuinely engaged in the process
yes but simply saying many players dont like these changes isnt meaningful input and currently that is all the voting threads are saying if the csm is to have a meaningful impact on this particular development issue they and the playerbase need to quickly move beyond supportreject and get into highlighting the specific problems that are solved and created by the proposal based on real analysis and active testing by the playerbasei guess my point is that demanding action from the csm on the basis of the vague polls is not productive we as the playerbase still have not yet provided them with real meat to work with and it is still our responsibility to present something meaningful for them to escalate to ccp a broad disatisfaction with the devblog is not a valid issue for escalation in my opinion
if you read the threads a decent number of the posts are actual argument instead of just a thumb and maybe some swearing aimed at the other side its not all by any means but its enough to sort of understand what the various opinions are on the topic the poll is unscientific yes but its the best weve got and its at least quantitative which is better than the precsm method of conducting similar threads on eve general
i just dont think a poll of players no matter how accurate is a suitable indicator of the justness of a balance issue it is an old saying that what is popular is not always right and what is right is not always popularthe way to impact a design plan like this is through reasoned argument and that can be done without tallying polls at all and id point out that that is the very purpose of the csm  to act as a filter and pluck good ideas out from the background noise of the forums the council members ought to be swayed by the strength of the arguments rather than the weight of numbers in a poll thats all im saying and i object to the notion that the nanonerf issue is a test of democracy for all of those reasons
ive been reading and contributing lots of feedback in the test server forum and ive run across several posts from ccp devs stating that suggest they arent looking for approval from the playerbase but that they are instead interested in feedbackbelieve it or not a lot of issues are being raised by players and answered by ccp already in just two daysmany of the issues brought up in the posts of those opposed are already said to being looked intoive been vocal that i do not think it is the csms place to oppose eve developer decisions despite explicitly stating attention the modifications discussed below are all subject to change based on player input and testing experiencethis is a playtester issue atm ccp has asked for and is looking for testers and feedback from the test server at this time and if you look through the most recent dev posts they are clearly quite annoyed by all of the flippant unhelpful repliesno doubt the 100 page of agree is not what ccp is interested in at this time
simplebring in the team of tourney commentators experts if you will and leave things in thier hands i would happily trust whatever recommendations they made over any csm member anywayeditand would live with the results without complaining but then againas they actually know something about eve combat operations in totali would rest pretty easy knowing the game wasnt going to be dumbed down furtherill put that in my expanded bio
its really good that youre highlighting this concern lavista if i can make a bold suggestion  the csm should just refuse to discuss ship balancing issues periodtrying to collect all the ship issues into one document is just going to obscure the real problem in a sea of frivolous complaints taking them one at a time and trying to determine which concerns are legit and which ones arent is going to waste the councils timeccp wants you to act as a filter so i suggest simply filtering out all ship balance issues  the worst case scenario is that something legitimately broken with a ship doesnt get raised to ccp but if you try to take up these sorts of issues you run the very real risk of wasting time that could be spent on the true big picture items that ccp wants the csm to be bringing to them
lavista this is a crosspost from warpdriveactivecomi agree with you that the csm in its current form might not be the best place to deal with detailed microlevel game issues like ship balancing i think there are bigger issues for the csm to be concerned with  and they should be the focus of the councilwhen important political issues get raised by citizens in their country they are discussed and widely debated by their political representatives and in the press however this is rarely at the level of detail of an exact amount a particular tax incentive should be set at or the precise amount of money which should be paid as a benefit to one group or another these details are worked out by the civil servants the unbiased subject matter experts who are not part of the political parties the people and their representatives debate the bigger ideasi guess my comparison is pretty obvious in my mind ccp are the civil servants of eve those with the detailed and crucially neutral view on the mechanics of a particular detailed aspects of the game  and perhaps with a better understanding of some of the wider issues a small change here or there may makeby comparison the csm should be about discussing the bigger ideas the widerreaching aspirations of the playerbase in evespecifically relating to ship balancing issues i think that the csm could usefully discuss a more streamlined channel as you mentioned in your post  but that you should otherwise have a handsoff approach if you attempted to act as arbitrators between ccp and those on the forums calling for x or y ship to be boosted or nerfed i think that the csm could become perpetually bogged down in those issues and never able to achieve its full potential to look at the bigger picturevm
vestik is right on  well said
very wellwritten post indeedbut here is something that makes me wonder i tend a link to this thread on the csm mailinglist but its only ankh who has actually responded what is up with that
they probably dont think it was worth posting out of lack of support but that was a rhetorical question right
hey how about this identify a thread that has adequate suportcsm does not vote or debate fix of shipssend it to the dev who works on these types of issues exclusivley in a tldr format another words the guy that works on this crap day in and day out can quickly identify if there is a problem or not and leave it up to him to essculate itcsm is still representing the player base and not sending in niggling issues to teh devs that are expecting different content
one obvious question springs to mind if ccp doesnt want to talk about balancing issues with the csm and the csm doesnt want to talk about balancing issues with ccp then why the hell did it get brought up in iceland who put it on the schedule and why was it just miscommunication and if so just address it for next time and if it wasnt discussed for any great length of time then the system seems to be working properly asis i dont want you wasting your time with issues that everybody agrees to be minor or even merely unarguable but banning balance discussions and things like that are really heavyhanded solutions to something that im not convinced is a problem the csm exists to discuss all everelated issues not just the vision stuff dont cut off a large swath of that just because its inconvenient  deemphasize it sure but dont eliminate it entirely

it is clear to me that this is a hot topici was really undecided in this as a rulethere are many ways to counter nanoships that nobody really wants to do because it requires coordination and brains to do itthe arguments on both sides are very compelling but it is clear to me just looking at these 2 threads that the playerbase has spokenlooks to me like the majority is against this nerf so i will support this motion that has no weight anyhow  ccp will do it no matter what is said
nano nerf can go die lots
against nerf speed  why not destroy speed tanking for cruiser sized vessels and above  no please not fair for those who cant shield or armor tankmake missiles the must have in small gang or solo pvp  its going to become the push the button it cant tank it anyway flavor of the month until the next nerf
too much too fast and too many flow on effects to missiles web scram and who knows what else if it is ever put into operationgood idea to reduce ludicrous speed but worst implementation ever

i have tried it but probably a lot of people voting against havent but i bet the same goes for people voting in favour and i also bet that i have more evidence that ccp nozh doesnt have a ing clue about what he is doing than that you have to the contrary using a vaga with t2 polys and a snakeset as an example of a setup with nothing special

the nerfs in current fashion are completly uncalled for and out of line
the speculation on the upcoming nerf is ruining my profits also the underlying issue of completly removing a viable tanking option speed isnt about running away its about engaging
against over powering missles

nano nerf is badmmmkay
i dont see why they need to remove content from the game

boo nano nerf is a fail idea

eventhough im amarr and a carebear this is too muchis a whole minmatar nerf what else are the rusty buckets good for if not speedjust to make drones hit or missilesnerf if you need too but dont kill the game
its true that nanos need to be nerfed and reworked but ccp has taken it way too far instead of spending time to think up a way of balancing things around the system that already exists they would rather bash everyting with the nerf bat till its totaly unrecognizable and redo the whole thing and basicaly say screw everyoen who has invested time and isk into the current system so against 100

im not particularly likely to create an alt but the thing that puts me off the idea the most is what youve said having to go back and mess with all those shortduration trainingsbut how about a simpler solution letting the chosen skill train continually until it hits level 5thats crude and lacking in sophistication but usually if a skill is worth training from 2 to 3 it is also worth training from 3 to 4
i love this idea
ive made extensive use of the possibility of dark training having been unsubscribed for 4 nonconsecutive months in order to train 4 hardcore skillz from level 4 to level 5 in the 16 months that ive been an eve player so fari believe im pretty much done with dark training now but it has been a great option to have and im sure that many players appreciate it ccp should think twice before they nerf dark training although theres no reason to boost it by allowing skill queues to be utilized while unsubscribed

i actually had a very long conversation with an excorpmate about how i was instinctively against nerfing or any other brand of balancing i went on to say that id be joining him in opposing the speednerf to be honest my resentment stems from the absolute castration of the arazu due to balancing they made it a cloaking cabbage thats only ever used for sitting at the back of the class wearing a dunces hat in recon gangs or scouting the opposition and staying cloaked as they slaughter your gang damps yes im afraid they are sir very damp indeed try a kleenexthe point of mentioning this was that ive always been of the impression that nerfing causes far more issues than it was ever designed to solve and compounds issues of balance its possible to find a use for the arazu you just have to be prepared to look for a while and its possible to beat a gang who are loaded with falcons when you yourself have none you just have to be prepared to think a little and try some offthewall setups to use a wellworn evecliche adapt or diethe problem as so wellstated in the blog best ive ever read is that adaptation meant getting nanoed up yourself to the ultimate boredom of all how many times have you seen nomwd  death in setup threads here or on shc aximoatic yep carved in radonspewing granite for us all to read for posterity speed counters speed so were all in inties hacs recons ea frigs and if were really cheap cruisers battleships only for specific engagements in one of my old alliances their use was banned yep battleships were banned for being fatarsed bargesso heres me voting yes for the very wellreasoned changesjust unnerf the arazu while youre at itnoone likes flying a cabbage

im for it ive give my reasons elsewhere so i wont divulge plus im sick of these threads so ill leave it at this one i think the nerf could be less severe polycarbs snakes and nanofibers being the main three items that actually needed the nerf im not sure about the rest but im glad something is being done about the issue
yes while the implementation will need balancing and the details ironed out the concept is solid and will provide a lot more ability for tactical fittings with lowerpowered webs larger turret and hopefully missile ships will actually require support to take out smaller ships which in my book is definitely a good thing

supporting a chribba thread
this made me giggle 
i would totally eliminate the localintellychat if you want to see people billions miles away you have to scan for it take a recon place some scantower that spread that intellgence infos to your corp or ally but if you roam in the wild you have to riskwhy i cant see rats in belts from the stargate or i cant see complexes without scan for it so i cant see people in system if their ships arent in overviewrange or scan range if i scan
a big no for this ideaso now you want to turn this game into who has the most time the most people at the time to enjoy the game
ok here is an idea which has been stated over and over again if this is implemented i would expectthe ability to put system scanner modules at poses without sovthat the ship scanner showed only ships that have pilots in them and some kind of iff system where you could ping a ships iff scanner and it would return friend for blue or unknown for neut or hostilelocal beacon counter ovbiously because a soverien power over a system with sov controls the gates their members should have an accurate local channel showing everyone since they control the gates and they should know who is in a system anyway
i love this idea i fully support removing local as an intel tool and replacing it with more active means of gathering intelligence ganking someone in your system should be about just watching local for an arrival and keeping an eye on your six should have more involved then popping a cloak every time an unknown pops upmoving the local info into constellation chat is just a step in the right direction as long as im allowed to close both
it is so simple to fix local without getting rid of it completelymake local chat a recent speakers channel instead of an immediate onethen you have a total count but the only faces you see are those that speak you can still gab with all your friends but youll have no idea that some outsider is about unless they choose to start gabbing too
i think nobody should be visible to you in local chat unless they either speak in chat thereby breaking radio silence or they are directly in the same grid as you the idea of me knowing whos jumping in and out of the system while im sitting in some belt so many au away is pretty unrealistic
agreed
the ability to research up t2 bpcs from invention should be goodno to creating t2 bpo  this is what invention was to get rid of more building slots on a character  will need more building slots in stations  though im all for mega advanced mas production as long as you have advanced mass production  5

after reading over everything it looks like people are pretty convinced that custom ships are a good ideaim not saying they arent but how would this change the marketpersonally im not a fan of contracts  and as it is you cant see which rigs are installed in a ship when its contracted to you that said i think that the market will need to be overhauled in order to accomidate the variations of each ship if they are as customizable as some of the posts suggest one dominix could have literally thousands of configurations obviously we dont want to open up our market window to see a listing for each one of these different variations under shipsbattleshipsgallentedominix so how does the market get fixed to handle it
qft i dont think i could have put this more eloquently myself
i want to expand the specialization further by making a char can only have one specialization skill if players want to learn a new spec skill the previous learned spec skill will be removed i hope this will diversify the industry and enhance the niche markettime to consider removed t1 loots and replaced it with resources alloy loot for t1 loot named bpc for named loot and turn everything into players produced market
i lend my support to this initiativei know they are working on it but they need to put more effort into fixing this key problem and less into adding new content that requires more large subsystems to tax the server new content is great necessary even but not at the expense of server performance problems that prevent the grandest of all pursuits in eve fleet warfare
praetor  can i have my thesaurus back now pleaseyou are right in everything you say but like others have said its not like ccp are unaware what does frustrate the hell out of me though is the fact that they ccp are working on things like ambulation which can only put more stress on the servers and therefore increase lag even moreif somebody wants to walk around  then let them do so in wow yes i said it  i prefer my pixels in spaceccp have certainly come up with some good lag reducers and have been flamed for it before people came to appreciate the benefits  we can all live in hope that they have another such ace up their sleeve
ccp if you would like to continue graciously accepting my money every month i want a playable game and when you get into a fight which your game allows and from all appearances is designed for and then you either spend the whole time staring at empty space or disconnect and spend that time staring at a login screen it really seems like im not exactly getting my moneys worth here in my option the situation is clear instead of giving us an update that clogs up the server with empire fighting hows about you spend all that money and time you spent developing that and implementing something more worthwhile to the thousands and thousands of people that live in 00 and fight vastly more meaningful battles now i dont expect lag to go away next update but when you dont even load the field or when fcs dont want to take their fleet against the enemy because the lag would be so bad that it would turn jumpgates in instaloose machines there is clearly more of a problem with the game than ships that can go really fastccp please get the game working to the point where we can actually engage in the types of fights that 00 calls for then add more to the game
fleet battles are partaken in by a minority of the playerbase and lag is basically the most difficult problem there is to fix also fleet battles as they at the moment wouldnt be that much fun even without lag flying around in blobs shooting one target at a timeit would be nice to have no lag for these battles but its not going to happen most likelyboth lag and fun issues would be will be  see fw fixed by making the most biggest fleet battles pointless by changing mechanics
reduce lag i want to see fleet fights like this in evenow thats what im talking about
no new content until lag is at least improved doesnt do any good to have piles of new shiny ships that die before your screen even loads
thanks for all the kind and critical words both are absolutely greeted with sincerity and gratitude because this is an issue that affects all of us and drives deep into the core of eves future as the worlds preeminent singleshard mmoit was brought to my attention in another forum that i left out a suggested solution to the lag issue involved with these ever increasing massive fleet battles i deliberately didnt include a suggested fix here to avoid having this thread descend into a debate of what is and is not technically feasible within the constraints of ccps budgeti believe that ccps initial shortsightedness in the early years of eve lead to the current lag fest that occurs on a daily basis although i admit their efforts to correct the situation have resulted in some improvements and are truly herculean however they are bandaids to scale eve to the size it needs to be and what it will become in the future will require totally new thinking about mmo software architecture and hardware deploymenti wrote a plea of emotion to engage us in our passion for what we love  eve online sometimes you need to appeal to people on an emotional level to feed the process of change motivate a mans soul and he will move accordinglythe hardware industry specifically the oems who build the servers eve and the rest of the world for that matter uses based on intel andor amd processors have let us down also many providers robust industry applications the world over are lulled into believing that the next thing will fix their performance woes we believe in the almighty predictive powers of moores law to save us from our prior sins of inadequate programming based on flawed assumptions and poor planning for future expansionmoores law doesnt specifically say processing power doubles what gordon moore said was that that the number of transistors that can be inexpensively placed on an integrated circuit is increasing exponentially doubling approximately every two years it is a common mistake to misinterpret moores law and assume it gives us a free ticket to doubled processing power every two years or so as wonderful as that would be however this just isnt the case processing power is also a function of the software doing the processing on the hardware transistorsthis is where i completely agree with how the current status quo came to be ccp definitely planned to be able to forklift upgrade their hardware when new cpus became available and just load the existing eve stackless python implementation on the new servers eve was conceived as a serially threaded application on a scalar processor architecture when at its very conception as a massive singleshard should have been built as as an hpc application with dynamically linked threadlet microthreads within a highly parallel stream processor architecture in ccps defense though there are many new concepts and capabilities today that didnt exist when they conceived eve ccp has had to bootstrap their way to success with eve and unfortunately in this business arrangement you cannot build out the best from the very beginning so this current dilemma is completely expected in some waysplanning to do forklift upgrades is an understandable misstep because nobody really wants to rewrite their software all the time its expensive and time consuming however ccp didnt plan perfectly for eves massive growth and the subsequent node scalability necessary for players converging on a single system node
at the same time they have subtlety pushed us to higher and higher concentrations of players participating in fleet battles through additional features and functions case in point view the flash graphic at the top of the empyrean age feature page
i like your vision and i imagine that ccp shares it im just rather fatalistic about the whole thing

ive never experienced my drones bumping me out of allignment during warp out good to know about the problem seems like the elimination of collision detection would solve at least four problems1 drone clumping2 ships being bumped by the drones3 computing resource drain by the drones in calculating their individual collision avoidance4 drones navigating around obstacles such as structure and asteroidsnot much to dislike there perhaps its time drones were able to partially phase out of normal space to allow them to pass through things including each other although youd still have to be able to shoot them that would only leave the problem of willful drones going their own way against orderswindjammer

i fully support thisthe beauty of eve voice is that you do not have to exchange server information cos its liked to the chat channels this is extremely useful when working with allies in factional warfare people who say idiotic statements like ventts  evevoice have obviously never engage in joint operations and therefore cannot speak on the matterhaving fced a number of ops with people outside of corpalliance i know that it is extremely frustrating to spend the majority of your time revealing otherwise sensitive information beyond this it is the worst nightmare of every fc to disconnect and not be able to tell the fleet to continue without them therefore it is essential that an external client should be made especially since the only real reason for integration in the first place was to support the original moneymaking scheme
should have to stay in a corp for atleast 24 hours imo except maybe npc corps
i completely agree i wasnt online for the war but from what ive heard its a total exploit and rediculous
the suggestion of a per player war flag perhaps as kills rights during a war sounds like a pretty good solution to the situation that way you get to streamline the application process allow for quick transfer of players from corp to corp and solve this issue with warring exploits that being said i completely support the cause
i support the op
i agree with desert viper
i also completely agree with desert viper
i agree with desert viper this is an exploit
i agree this is an exploit
i agree total exploit
this is what i would like to see the problem with this exploit is the complete surprise attack that can happen when an application is accepted and the guy next to you can become a war target at the time of his choosinghaving to dock to accept the employment offer would definately fix this
i like these ideas im interested in making the titan a more tactical instrument however id like the value andor impact to continue to justify the large investment requiredi would like to see the doomsday become a defensive aoe effect with reduced or diversified damage the range should be enough to be meaningful i would select 200km and certainly not full grid lets change the cooldown to 5 minutes we need to make it a challenge to take one of these downid like the offensive weapons to be tactical in nature my favorite idea at the moment is to create a siege jammer module only for the titan while activiated no capital ships on the grid may go into siege or triage mode so the effect is that you can protect your pos from capital blob death at the same time you have to scramble and stay focused to prevent the titan from going down as well these effects might result in more interesting fleet fights i know that we already have blob issues really though i cant think of a suggestion that would eliminate that so if we have blobs lets make them deal with multiple concurrent objectives more tactical options and strategies will add diversity and interest to the fleet engagementscheers m8s
yes a solo player with the work of hundreds to produce and maintain even one titan
actually why not make titans a antibs capital using doomsday becomes like s seige mode gives it massive tracingsig resexp velocity etc bonus making it able to fight bss though hics can go under its gunsjust about everybody wants to see titans in the front line fighting so what about thatotherwise a ew titan is just a capital sized stealth bomber using ew bombs
yes we need moar sheepz not able to hit stuff we dont have that already
i agree that the titan dd in its massive dmg  huge range version and coupled with the tactic of deploying multiple titans is overpoweredi dont disagree with the proposed changes but in order to support the idea i would like to see it more thought through  refinedexpanding on your idea maybe more specialised effects not neccessarily linked to race of titan as it already gets racial bonus but maybe link those to titan modules like siege mods so that every titan pilot can decide to do these new effects but maybe one titan can do a certain effect eg your proposed energy neutralization a little bit better than the other titans this would not only open the possibility of future module balancing  introduction without entirely changing the ship itself but also add some options to fitting titans i guess one of those titan modules could very well be a dmg titan mod meaning the dd is kept in a certain way but in future it needs to be focused on one hostile ship maybe with a limited aoe that could be used vs bs blobs that warp in all together to the same spotnothing to do with your idea but even that the dd is overpowered if it gets removed in its current version the defensive capabilities of a titan need to increase quite a bit in order to not only make them viable to stay on the battlefield and to use whatever new offensive options they get but also to ensure the investment that was needed for all those titans that exist already
youre right it doesnt have to be racial by titan how about making it so any titan can use any one ddd and yeah more than 4 of them isnt a terrible idea either
titans need a massive boost to their guns to where 67 guns would do around 510k dps and be able to track very slow bs then they need their doomsday changed the ideas here are a good start if it was viable to fit guns instead of smartbombs if committing a titan to a battle meant you not only get his bonuses but hes actually useful beyond his dd if hotdropping a titan right outside of a pos shield meant that you were going to lose dreads then the titan would begin to be used how it should like the biggest ugliest mother ship out there one you dread seeing warp in ontop of either your dread fleet or bs fleet not because it could dd which you can sometimes warp out of but because every second that titan is sitting there its doing massive damage to your fleetproblem is this makes the titan vulnerable which encourages huge support fleets which means titans would create bigger blobs as it is now the dd is best for the game because the titan can act as a solopwnmobile and not need 200 support ships to warp in and dd how to solve this im not sure 
like i said giving them access to the good oldfashioned siege module is a good start they have a pile of gun slots and a capital tank if the highs were ddd siege 6 guns and they had cap and fitting to run 2x capital shield booster or 3x capital armour repper theyd be able to tank a good 30k dps or so and dish out better than 10k on top of having a massive amount of ehp a gang bonus like no other and a crazyawesome ewar effect itd be worth leaving them in the fight at that point theyd still be killable of course and probably more killable than they are at presentsince theyre in combat instead of safed and cloaked but theyd also be worth bringing to the table for reasons other than killing one support fleet per hour it looks to me like itd be a far healthier state of affairs
the doomsday needs to be replaced with something that ensures the titan is still deployed onto a battlefield and kept there for more time than it takes to align out still has a unique and powerful role but doesnt win a fight solo making the doomsday scriptable would also add a new tactical dimension to a fight it means titans are more flexible and would be used and therefore destroyed more often in combathere are the ideas i likeaoe ewara racial ewar effect that requires the titan to stick around to work ideas that have already been mentioned include warp scrambling mwd inhibition webification an ecm pulse and a neutralizing effect that removes a  of cap from every ship in rangeweakened doomsdaylike a hybrid of current doomsdays and smartbombs low damage pulses over a massive range designed to counter drones fighters frigates and finish off capsules a real antiblob weapon that doesnt require a blob to counter itfocused blastthe doomsday acts as a special siege module immobilising the titan for x amount of time but giving it a massive rofdamage modifier to its capital weapons useful to turn the tide in capital battles and actually makes the racial titan weapon bonus usefulthis script will require a cooldown before being used againremote interferencesimilar to the siege module effect above when this script is fired upon a target it does no damage but prevents all remote assistance modules armour shield and energy transfers being used on it for as long as the titan keeps the doomsday active now the titan can be used to help kill other supercaps but must be committed to a fight to do sonone of these scripts will wipe out an opposing fleet solo and require the titan to be used alongside a support fleet to be effectiveand as a side note i would also like to see a new hislot repair bay module for motherships and titans this is activated and uses fuel akin to a clone vat bay and allows gang members within range to repair damage to their ships and modulesi did the majority of production for my titan its really not challenging to semiafk haul freighters around via jumpbridges for a few hours
these are awesome
having a siege module for a titan would never work simply because nobody is going to put a 50bn isk ship into siege for 10 minutes when its very commonly known that any titan will die really fast to a gang of nothing more than 15 dreads so either make a new siege module or give a titan a bonus to cycle time and stront amount to where the cycle is 20 or 30 seconds and any titan can fit enough stront for 2 hours of constant sieging make the titan commit to the battle but make it possible to turn of his siege mod and have a chance of getting out if he gets hotdropped this way its still going to take 30 seconds to a minute to be aligned out after he gets hotdropped i think thats a sufficiently gaping vulnerability to balance it however again the titan must be able to function better than any other ship in normal fleet and capital combat
or give the titan another role bonus that says that siege mode doesnt prevent incoming logistics might be overpowered but it seems reasonable to me also means you wouldnt need to change around the capacitor and stuff to allow it to have a bigger native tankactually yeah this is a better version of what i was saying above thumbs up interesting im tempted to just say youd use nanite paste from the corp hangar but something along those lines is reasonable stick up a new thread on the idea
at face level it sounds like a good idea but in reality this is what will happen 1 attacking fleet enjoys the light show2 everyone came fitted with cap boosters and a few 800s in the hold so they all restore cap3 10 of the fleet of 100 ships has a module with 25 heat damage nanites applied4 continue to kill now nuetered titan 5 since there is no reason to warp out the 25 second warp recalibaration is not a problem6 titan goes boom
titan would force a fleet to come prepared with cap boosters nanite paste and other special titan killing stuff in their backpacks leaving less room for ammo and filling up power slotstitan would need a support fleet and could not be deployed on its own or it would get popped because it engaged a hundred ships by itself makes sense stupid titan pilotoh yeah and we all get a light show how are these bad things
25 heat damage destroys a mod until docked in station and repaired no amount of nanite past can repair a fully damaged mod from my understanding of the mechanicas for the cap boosters trying to rely on those in fleet combat is pretty tough for most standardized fleets when you factor cargo lag and potentially multiple doomsdays youre fleet is going to be very crippled while titans are still more exposed by this point10 chance of losing a mod was added to create both a permanent advantage of a dd weapon in a fight and a bonus to multiple dd while not being overpoweredagain if you time it right and lead a fight with a dd as your fleet is coming outta warp that can be a huge advantagexttz i understand the reason for scripting but im not a huge fan of that particularly being the dd weapon maybe just different mounts capable of going on a titan in general
modules have 40hp the heat damage could be increased so that some modules are untouched some damaged and some incapacitated
when i reactivate yaay later today ill up heat dmg then my mistake
no brainer proposal is no brainer

no  you are destroying another profession call it market trading or whatever you like removing t1 loots only helps on group 00 miners and more lps for mission runners is a joke  nice way to even devalue lps even more and building named items will make the mission runner income even less due more of those items be availablebasic economics with that one supply and demandremove macro  farmers from belts and missions and then you will see mineral prices raise especially the ice marketedit btw what you all are talking is massive revamp of the industry profession it all dominos into each other one thing will change another and so on you cant remove t1 loots without some other massive changes to both industry and mission running
i used to ninja run missions out in 00 a while ago loot was the only was i could build more ammo as most npc 00 areas that arnt hevily occupied have little on the market with no loot the small guy trying to do a few 00 missions will have to find another way to get the bits and bobs for ammoalso im sure the bigger alliances dont need to what with the increase in caps being able to jump ammo out but smaller 00 alliancescorps with limited cap ships use loot to reprosses for more ammo replacment ships ecti dont care either way what happens with loot drops tbh im just throwing some info out there
i like signed
yes but perhaps you should make that reply in a thread where the proposal actually is a nobrainer this ones actually got a lot of possible problems
i still maintain that removal of t1 loot will not do what people want it to do it will not cause miners to make as much isk as mission runners see this for an explanation of this assertionso the question is whats the purpose for removing t1 loot is it so that the role of miners is clearly separated from the role of mission runners if so thats probably a reasonable goal to most peoplebefore i support this i want to see concrete objectives that are the goals rather than an its broken fix it thing for example while many dont like the upcoming speed changes the dev blog did state the design goals clearly at the beginning given those goals the changes they propose would be the right directionalso im not sure that miners can provide the current mineral demand of the eve population so removal of loot would cause a massive depression as people cant get the resources they need when they want them of course maybe the apparent demand for minerals is mostly due to trading  its hard to tell without more information perhaps the miners are more than up to the taskso the relevant discussion id like to see in any discussion here in assembly hall not just this onewhat are the goals of the proposed changecan the eve universe tolerate the changes without reducing the current standard of living for the pilots
that is part of the problem its very easy for them to rack up on standing so they work the level 4s and flood the market with cnrsthe only thing you can do now is probe them out and steal the mission objective which causes them lost standing lp and timethey also get very upset 
while i dont look at the issue as acrimoniously against ccp as many on this thread and i do understand that dedicating employees at ccp to hunting these guys down is expensive as are the possible legal ramifications i still would like more action taken against these peopleyou can dress up whatever is happening to you any way you want but unfortunately the root of the matter is not the vigilantes its you youre getting ganked because youre not paying attention people arent going to have any sympathy the moment you admit youre windowed out of eve and expecting a safe steady income flow i usually dont support gank activity of innocents in eve as a matter of my own temperament but i have to say theyre right in this caseits the same as someone deciding to afk in a supposed safe spot in a 00 system for hours on end while they go do something else for whatever reason then coming home and being upset when someone probed him out and popped him or freighter haulers who autopilot afk warp system after system then are surprised that someone scanned their slowboat and suicide ganked it for the goodies it carriedi have a problem with ganking when it occurs to players who are paying attention but are helpless due to game mechanics lag and similar things but you could save those hundreds of millions of isk simply by paying attention to the gameyeah mining is boring and its so easy that you can do it while youre doing something else but that doesnt mean you should

ive an idea to stop isk farmers once a day you get a message that pops up on screen to get your ship into a station theres a 15 minute countdown that flashes to do this and when this over another countdown appears on your screen and in this time no concord action or gate guns are activated this will catch out the isk farmers as this action will be randomised daily and at this time pirates and gankers can have a field day well 15 minutes to kill anyone that caught in space with no aggro timer or sec lossok flame away
ok i support much of whats being said in this thread but the comment above is seriously off the deep end how can you justify bringing the law into this in such a way selling virtual items should be illegal thats as asinine as any law proposal ive ever heard fraud is when someone misleads another to purchase an item that they have misrepresented to be something it isnt at least thats one example of fraud please tell me how selling a virtual item for real money is fraud by any definition of the word its already against the eula to do rmt and other selling of virtual eve assets thats as far as we need to go eve has all the power they need to suspend accounts and ban players
my 02 isk assume on average 50 of players will not buy isk 25 are farmers and 25 will buy isk what you need to do is get the players who are buying isk onto your side the simplest way to do this is to reward players for turning in rmt characters and reporting sitesex im flying my ship around trading when i get an evemail for a website where i can go to buy iskmaybe i report the mail maybe i just dont care and delete it if i report the mail ccp determines its legit and does something ccp gives me some isk even if they just give me say 1 million isk thats 1 million isk i didnt need to make missioning etc heck give me the equivalent of 1 milion isk in loyalty points with a factional navypolice force for reporting criminal activity all of a sudden everyone reporting these people has an incentive to both make reports and make factual reports as you only get paid if the gms find somethingthis takes more isk out of the economy than ccp gives me so there is a loss of isk but i get rewarded for caringsecond penalize players less for buying isk off of a site if they report the site this turns the players against the site ex i buy 100 mil isk off of some website then tell ccp that ive done it and give them the details ccp then can go in and say hmm this guy got 100 mil from this website and this character and follow the money back ban all of the characters involved in the money trading scheme and confiscate the iskthey probably do some of this already but now they have player support and a much easier time tracking people down everyone who doesnt report the rmt site is caught and the money is taken along with a warning from concord or scc and possibly a security status drop the warning should read something like thisdear player nameas part of an ongoing investigation into illegal isk trading an informant gave us information indicating that you acquired amount confiscated illicitly these funds have been confiscated pending investigation you received these funds on transaction date from other transaction party for his services the informant was given amount of isk andor lps and appropriate faction as part of our informant policy which states that any person reporting the existence of an illicit isk trading scheme will be rewarded if the investigation is successful as part of the investigation concord has lowered your security status by amountthe player or players who report the rmters are allowed to keep all of the isk or some of the isk or a percentage of all of the isk obtained ask the economist which would do the least damage while creating a viable incentiveif you just target the people selling the isk all youll do is cause prices to increase because the companies doing this increase their risk maybe youll catch some people but its a drop in the bucket once you turn the player base against the farmers specifically the player base that uses farmers youll notice some gains plus you make the players themselves afraid of not turning the isk sellers in because if they dont someone willi dont buy isk but im a bit poor in eve if ccp would reward me for buying isk and using the transaction logs to turn the farmers in i might buy a little bit and turn the rmters in i wont shell out 20 bucks for ccp to do its job but i wouldnt mind buying cheap isk if itd help ccp catch those responsible i know that a lot of people will argue no we shouldnt have to reward people for doing this they should out of the goodness of their heart id agree with that mostly the problem is that the people buying the isk arent going to report it under the old system i feel like this system encourages people to track down people trading isk illegally rewards people for using ccp to handle the issue instead of taking it into their own hands
ive posted this some months ago in the ships and modules section with limited success please take a quick look on my arguments1 skilltimeactually the time between the covetor and the hulk is less than 2 days just exhumers iii this is pointless no one is actually flying a covetor except for pricing reasons i suggest to reduce astrogeology to lvl3 for the covetor or increase exhumers to 4 for the hulk this isnt much just some 5 days2 fittingall barges come with only one med slot obviously to fit a rock scanner as even a 10mn afterburner requires too much powergrid i dont see any reason why this ship is beeing held so limited in its options miners are sitting ducks anyways with a 3 med cov and a 2 med retriever they could at least try to defend themselfes i would be very pleased if the csm would bring this forward in their next meeting
i defer to chribba on a better judgement of the covetors value for mining veld but im fairly certain hell just tell you to get a revelation fit with m2mdcm2sdo the macro miners still fly these death traps
agreed on both pointsfor 1 i think reducing the skill requirements of the covetor rather than increasing the skill requirements of the hulk is the solution astrogeology v is one of the big time sinks that go into transitioning from the retriever to the covetorfor 2 i like your suggestions but lets be careful about making barges too capable for balancing purposes it is and should be very dangerous to operate a barge solo in low or nullsec and we shouldnt be making it easier however the ability to fit an ab would be very useful these ships are so painfully slow it takes ages just to travel from one end of an asteroid belt to another when they have to
thanks for your reply tesseract i understand your concerns about 2 but i dont see a big problem in more meds ok you could skip that rock scanner and make an ore overview setup which would leave you then with 2 or 3 meds for pvpwhatever what would one possibly fit 2 is too few for anything you call a tank 3 maybe slightly but without those t2 resist of the hulk you could go with an ecm granted but you can actually do it as well if you dismiss that rockscanner not checked cpu for this to be honest the idea for this came when i was high sec mining in my hulk can flippers in frigs and cruisers flying around me and stealing my wrecks looking for a fight fitting a hulk with webberscrambler and see if my t1 hobbies could deal with that frig would be interesting but 100m risk and not satisfactory insurable in a 17m covetor with a scrambler and invu i would have tried

ships held in the ship maintenance bay smb of capital ships are unable to hold cargo other than charges originally this was added to force a change over from using hauling carriers to having people use more rorquals and jump freighters its now seven months later and this has happened these ships are commonly available on the market and used to move cargo by those who need to do so mineral compression has been nerfed severely with the size and composition of many items changed so now i have to ask  why is this annoying restriction neededissuesa while ammo and charges can still be held many ships require other items in their cargo to be used cynofitted ships no longer keep their ozone with them many combat ships often change their fittings in space using the refitting ability of an smasmb they now need to rely on corporate hangar arrays and shared roles with other corp members in order to keep things like this outside a station b this restriction affects the anchored ship maintenance array at a starbase i cant think of any logical reason for this beyond programming laziness no one is going to pick up an anchored starbase module and move the ships with cargo inside them smas are however very useful for players in remote or unfriendly space to keep their ships this restriction makes it much harder to keep fuel or alternate fittings without relying on shared corporate hangar tabs if ccp wants to encourage pvp in more of 00 space one of the first steps should be to make it easier to live there without a station to dock inc abandoned ships are much harder to clean up previously if someone left old ships inside a starbase shield a carrier could simply fly by and scoop them up now its a much bigger chore to clear away old ships such as rookie ships left in a starbase with 1 unit of trit in their cargo  every ship much be boarded and moved one at a time this of course also applies to ships left in starbases from long before the cargo nerfthis restriction is no longer needed please remove it
please do this
well stated makes good sense i support this proposal
voting for great justice
do it 
agreed
yes
oops you have a cyno frigate that you want to scoop into your bay too bad its got liquid ozone in its cargooops this ship had alternative shield repping modules to swap for its weapons and did so at your carriers maintenance array cant put that in your smbplease change this please for the love of god its stupid and it makes me hate you just a little more
devs if it really bothers you then just change it to not being able to store a ship with more than 1000m3 in its cargo bayplease
yes
i see the reason for the change but it was hamfisted and im not convinced it was necessary either do something better or just dont do anything at all but ammo only is really not the right answer
trying explain to people what counts as ammo what doesnt that stupid autoload of tritthis change would make life so much easier in dealing with dumb newbiesgoons having to go 2 jump bridge hops to switch from being a priest domi to something with range big pain leaving my fittings in an open access hanger is not a good idea either
yes i totally disagreed with this nerf on rp grounds and on the fact that it just annoys everyone whilst encouraging nothing jump freighters and rorquals are way more efficient at moving things than carriers used to be so if you need to move lots you will continue to use these ships
if i ever decide to rp an amarr slave trader and want to have a carrier filled with haulers full of slaves can i guess not signed
completely agree the reason for this change is no longer relevant time to rollback to the way things were its a pain in the neck to load up my exotic dancer booze smokes and my trusty copy of pax amarria onto my pvp boats each time i go outedit for approval
agreed
is there any reason not to allow this ie right click on a scan result from probes create bookmark i dont really know the backstory behind probes but presumably they give your ship coordinates to warp to so why shouldnt we be able to bookmark it the results get cleared when you change session so you cant dock and get another ship to warp to results in the case of exploration this means i either have to warp my expensive cov ops into a potentially dangerous site or i have to leave it at a safespot while i warp in my pod to bookmark in the case of player probing it means you have to warp in the cov ops first which may get decloaked and alert the target when it would be more practical to go straight in with a combat ship
fixing the ghastly ui issues would make me happier than three icelandic girls spending a vacation with mewell ok almostwhy is it not done yet when can we expect it to be doneas far as im concerned the ui bugs are the top of my list of reasons to not login
i have a ui issue that is really more annoying than anythingthe border of a window or dialog will not be where its drawn and you can see that by trying to resize a window or even just close onerestarting the client fixes it but yeah its annoying
ive been saying this for months now look up xaens multiyearold list of ui improvements the vast majority of which still havent been implemented its pathetic
do it
edit this is just a guess i am not an it professional hes rightmy guess as to why it was removed the ship you are piloting is the only ship that can be renamed refitted ammo reloaded etc all other ships are database items and by limiting the actions that can be performed on them streamlines serverclient relationsedit found a good reason for this feature
signedau contraire fahtim its yet one more example of something that got changed for no real benefit youre telling me that renaming an item is going to slow down a database versus having to initiate a session change associated with jumping into each shipas an it professional with over 15 years experience in dealing with databases i find this laughable that it was even changed steathily as it was it not only makes the user work harder but is a pointless necessity that could have been left well enough aloneoh not even counting the amount of times the user has to click only to find scotty tell them to hang on a few more seconds what ridiculous
man i have no idea why they removed this but would be awsome to see it come back
i was just giving a reason as to why ccp did it i never said they were stellar programmers like yourself well i guess they are stellar programmers in the literal sense or is that the figurative trying not to be so postironicchanging my mind however bc im sure this is a pain for the people running our free frigate program didnt think of that earlier
i like this idea too its not a game breaking change or anything just an annoyance that would be nice to get rid of
yep this has been ed since like forever
making mining more interesting to the degree that a human miner is willing to do it while paying attention and is encouraged to do so while paying attention in order to maximise his profits as opposed to the current system where mining is done as a semi afk activity at besti realise that fluctuations on mining activity ripple through the markets in eve given that its one of the primary sources for materials for the majority of items sold on the market or should be but thats a different issue supply and demand however dictates that these fluctuations will be ironed out reasonably wellfor example im primarily a mission runner at the moment running right on the edge of low sec occasionally getting missions into low sec itself surprisingly ive never had pirate trouble since basing myself there despite people telling me that every route into low sec is a multi heavy interdictor gate camp with no chance of getting through however say the price of tritanium went up to 4 isk per unit well ive got a mining barge on standby to help cover that demand and would happily put missions on the back burner for a time to deal with thatand im sure many others out there would be the same mission runners traders industrialists pvpers pirates etc if the opportunity for profit were there people will take advantage of it
on a general bad idea to make mining more tedious without any advantage for the player doing it running around in a belt to find the 10 of asteroids that arent barren is the worst part want to have that kind of fun form a gang pick a belt tag every asteroid with a number from 1 to 10 and then throw a 10 sided dice mine only the asteroid with the number you generated you will see very fast how fun is running around with your barge to lock the next available asteroid mining with guns is already better in most situations you really want to make it always better
well if you want to mine a clearly marked barren asteroid then thats your business however if you read through my idea youll realise that the asteroids only change to being a barren asteroid once all the ore is depleted out of them when these respawn as fresh asteroids then they show as being mineablewant to be locating easy ore day in day out dont strip the noob belts cleanbesides this only applies to the newbie belts if youre in the position where youve skilled up into a mining barge then you take your mining serious enough to go hunting for more lucrative untouched belts using the exploration systemironically im of the belief that mining with guns should not be as large a source of minerals as it currently is hence why i supported the idea of removing t1 loot drops and the idea of adding t1 components to the gamemining should be the source of mineralsnpc rats should be the source of componentsboth should be needed for production thus making both roles equally important in the production chain
i support the ops idea and the direction its taking but i would also like to add my support for the addendum i quoted above these additions should add extra value for those who choose to make use of them but they shouldnt be mandatory
you are really naive and havent really read my example 1 so long as veldspater stay the basic mineral for tritanium it will be mined by people that need tons of tritanium independently if it is a noob mineral or not it was mined when mining omber and kernite gave x3 or x4 times the isk of veldspater it is mined today that it is the best high sec mineral 2 i got that your not barren asteroid are identifiable at range the point is that they will not be near each other so you will need to move from one to the other probably you dont know how the tag work so they are visible if you enable the relative column in overview the proposal was to get the feeling of moving from 1 not barren asteroid to the next with your idea it is almost guaranteed that there will not be a second not barren asteroid within your stripminers range even less if you are using mining lasers3 your idea is that 10 of the barren asteroids revert back randomly every day you really think that they will survive much after dtdont strip the noob belts clean and that what would mean go there and run a cycle on each asteroid each day you have already substituted the current system where all asteroid grow in content every a few day with your where 10 of the barren asteroid respawn so the better system to get the highest number of asteroids is exactly the reverse generate as much barren asteroids as possibleas it will increase the number of new spawned full asteroids
i dont believe that i stated anywhere in my idea that this would completely replace the current system for replenishing belts its intended to compliment that systemso basically if you mine an asteroid but leave some of the ore behind then it will replenish slowly as it does at the momenthowever if you fully deplete an asteroid it wont pop like it does at the moment instead itll be represented as a barren asteroid and have a 10 chance each downtime to return as an asteroid with its ore content maxed outso if you want to be guaranteed a steady supply of ore then you never want to mine out an asteroid completely however if you want to be hunting for single asteroids that could keep even a hulk running for multiple cycles then youll want to find the fresh asteroids that have replaced barren asteroids
so we have the even worse situation with a belt full of low content asteroids and some hidden as they are all not barren good asteroids and you need to shoot your your scanner 15 km range or a little more at best limited by your barge sensor range to the asteroid to know the mineral content we are still at the same point i think that making a barge running around to find the right asteroids is bad you seem to like ityou have more than a year experience in game so if you have specced for them you should know how slow are the barges and how nonproductive is to run around dropping 1 can here one there each time your ship is full even worse yout idea will ruin group mining as people will not have the possibility to mine decent asteroids and share a can for easy pick up for the hauler
or you could use a mining frigate in a prospector role to locate the good asteroids before your barge even gets to the belt thus minimising the maneuvering you need to do with the flying housebricks that are mining barges the idea isnt to support a semi afk style of play but to reward those who put in the effort to locate the decent depositsyou seem fixated on the idea of just warping to a belt in a barge and hoovering up anything in range like you can currently now this is still possible with the exploration sites again taking the effort to locate such a site if you personally dont have the skills to locate these sites im sure that there are people in your corporation that can and will for a reasonable share of the profits to cover their expenses and timeif youre a solo miner however then it just means you need to work a little harder to keep up with those using teamwork effectivelyedithaving reread this i apologise if this came across as being a little too harsh this wasnt my intention
i am fixated on the idea that requiring more effort for the same return isnt making mining better is making it worse
i agree that could introduce in costlymaterial reapair system  isk sink  improve economypilots may try to disable ships warpcore or weapons even in missions where someone ask for bosses have to flight the battle pilots may disable bosses ships as a mission itself say no need to kill everythingits annoying to see that a ship with only 1 one structure hitpoint is 100 combat efficent like a full shieldarmorstructure shipi think this would be a hard revamp of the combat system
this is a good point and a good balancetargeting subsystems would require that they be pronounced enough to lock onto in the first place so i could see the option only appearing for certain classes of ships to begin with a frigate is so small by comparison that you could try to aim for the engines and wind up hitting the shield generators instead plus they are easy enough to kill that called shots wouldnt be worth itwhile a titan or even a bs are surely big enough to land shots on specific systems without too much collateral damageperhaps one solution to this dilemma would be adding a stronger sensor module kinda like the ship or cargo scanners sure it takes up an extra slot but so what you get to disable ships rather than just destroy them you can deal with one less slotso you lock onto a bs and fire away or you lock onto the bs and then start scanning now an extra window opens up displaying the sensitive systems onboard you click on one and start to lock on youd be using the same weaponry which means your scan resolution will factor in and the effective signature radius of such a tiny part of the ship could be impossible for one bs to fire upon another bs but those little frigates flitting about could definately get a lock onto the soft underbelly of the opponents titan or momso here we go called shots for ships subsystems you can attempt it in your mega if you like or you can hand the job off to that little enyo someone decided to bring along just in case
i really like the idea of subsystem targeting and i have a way that it might be possible in a preliminary stage without too many balancing headachesthe chance of hitting a ships module is relative to the weapons signature resolution vs the ships signature radiusif the targets shields are up you can hit highslot modulesif their armor remains you can hit highslot and midslot modulesif their armor is gone you can hit all modulesthis also has the side effect of giving a boost to ships that regularly engage larger targetshacs vs battleshipsfrigates vs anythingbattleships vs capitalscapitals vs motherships and titansi think that might work as a first step
how could that possibly be implemented another right click menu of course it would be nice to do that but i assume its ages to early to speak about and there are a lot of other things to do first taramics idea looks much more convertible just like critical hits in other fantasy games
lots of miners are afraid to go into low sec or 00 mining barges are too slow and fragile to survive solosmall gang low sec or 00 mining ops how about adding a new t2 mining cruiser that can mine more than its t1 counterpart but less than a mackinawhulkcovetor if it can mine moreas much as a barge then we would just see them in high sec a lot also it shouldnt use strip miners or mining lasers it should be able to use its kind of mining laser one that can use mining crystals it should also get a bonus to mining range this way it can be far away from the warp to 0 point on a belt and far away from scram range a bonus too cargo capacity and drone damagemining yield also might be a good idea the slot configuration should be dependent on the race but there should be enough low slots to strike a good balance between nano mods and cargo mods this way it can hold ore and also align to warp quickly the ultimate goal of this ship class is to encourage more people to venture from high sec and go into low sec and 00 and to diversify the ships you can fly here is the abridged version t2 mining cruiser custom mining lasers that can use mining crystals bonuss to mining laser range cargo capacity drone damagemining amount slot configuration allows for nano and cargo mods mines less than the good mining barges covetorhulkmackinaw encouarges pilots to venture into lowsec00
i approved this ideas prototype thread in sm and i approve this one a more durable cruiser for mining is a nice idea to add some variety to low sec if they mine less than mining barges they wont crowd empire but with increased survivability they may make some miners bold enough to enter low sec should this happen there will most likely be an increase in mining ops and even solo mining thus increasing the population in low sec which is more fun and money for pvpers and miners alikei like to think that these proposed ships are to mining barges as blockade runners are to industrials
i was thinking about that for sometimetotally agree
would this perhaps go along with the request for a visible timer on moduleseveryone has suggested the rotating clock animation to signify how long before your miners or reppers run another cyclecould that get implemented and made sure to appear obvious to satisfy this request for more noticable activity
and if the learning skills would be some sort of boost skill like drugs boost that fade away the more they are used until no more sp remains and noone could use again some sort of pool to spend after char creation to speed up your knowledgeto newbies it would be a boost more exiting esperience learning new skills piloting more ships using more weapons to veterans they dont need them more as they already know the how to as my 3m sp in learnig actually are time boost
if a player is only going to play the trial and never beyond that then of course they wouldnt train learning skills theyd ask why do i need those to learn faster i dont plan on sticking around that long anywaysbut the vast majority of players intend on sticking around for a while at least until they get suicide ganked and can flipped a few times and get fed up with the attitude and atmosphere of pvp pirates but i digressplayers use the free playtime during trial periods to get the learning skills out of the way because they are such a necessity to getting anywhere in a reasonable amount of time and despite the repeated attempts no one will ever raise a valid argument that learning skills are still optional only about as optional as drinking water and sleeping sure you can go without it but youd probably regret itmaking isk and buyingreplacing ships those things happen all the time but you cant do any of it until you learn the skills first thats why players reinforce that learning skills may not be the only thing you study but they are a very high priorityi said it before and ill say it again im for getting rid of the learning tree its not something people could do to make themselves better its something people have to do if they want to play the game sometime this yearif getting rid of them means that each and every skill takes days to complete then so be it i dont imagine that ccp would do that to their playerbase since a lot of folks would say this takes too long and leave for other mmosif that means that those skill points just evaporate completely with no form of reimbursement then so be it sure some players might whine about time spent but how would you rationalize spontaneously rearranging memories and training to support the redistribution afterwards you went to sleep one night and forgot how to study faster and woke up the next morning knowing how to pilot a hac instead
i agreed to the need of revamp the mission system really good ideasfor your asking question about how to a player could create a mission if a corp or an alliance wolud create a contractlike post asking we will pay 5 billions isk if you destroybringtoreinforcedmode the corpname pos in systemnamemoonnumber  maybe before datetime or even we will pay 200 millions isk at everyone who partecipate the siege todestroybringtoreinforcedmode the corpname pos in systemnamemoonnumber 
i approve of anything that adds more random elements to the pve gamear
agreed and maybe blinkng or changing colour on the time numbers just to warn
with the current contracting system it is impossible to contract ships that are fitted with faction or t2 crystals as the game seems to think they are a damaged item this is the only type of ammo affected this way and it is incredibly burdensome and annoying if someone using rails wants to give their ship to a corp mate to move in his carrier he simply contracts it over and its done if someone using lasers that happen to have faction or t2 crystals fitted wants to they have to jcfly all the way there wait for the other person to be around and then manualy trade the ship to them which then completely defeats the purpose secondly it means that you cannot even attempt to sell ships stuck in hostile stations via contract if they happen to have faction crystals fitted it is incredibly rediculous that this is still an issue this long after contracts were introduced there has to be some way to redo the system for t2 and faction crystals to distinguish them from damaged modulesshipsdrones etc

weve all had it happen were involved in a battle and manage to dock up with heavy damage for whatever reason we were unable to use our repair modules while out in space and now were deep into armor or hullwere low on isk and the repair centre says itll cost you more than you have my friendyou think thats ok ill just undock and use the repair modules when its safe to do sothe battle rages on outside and ends and youre ready to fly back into safe space to rep up no such luck youre too badly damaged to undock you dont have the isk to repair at the station facilities what do you dowell if youre just sitting in the docking area anyway why not just use those repair modules of yours save yourself the isk of using them and you still have to wait out the repair time rightccp let us use repair modules while docked

while it takes away from the repair shops profits right in front of their faces youd normally just undock and repair right outside their back door while having a smoke

so as we can see i have out did my reputation far by creating such havok with this forum heheh
this is an interesting post imo ingame circumstances have a lot to do with the stances on the very issues we are talking about this is why this csm project is fluff and the reason it will inevitably fail imosince politics is an intrical part of eve you cannot seperate the two the higher levels of this game are all about posturing and using any methods created by ccp including the forums to win and in some cases metagaming such as buy time cards and other less then desirable meansyour proposal of dropping politics is essentialy saying ignore that portion of the game since the politics along with the controlling of territory that is entwined with that is the reason many people play the game what you are asking is impossiblegood suggestion goonies as some people are not cut out for the job however since ingame you are my enemyincluding these forums and all that it pertains i will not allow you to use the forums the csm or any other body or element of this game to gain any advantage thus in this instance i will disagree with you the sole reason has already been statedyou have two standing members in the csm i reserve the right to change my opinion at any time to include a time when there are no goonies on the afformentioned board or whenif i suddenly become allied with you or your goals coincide with mineif that reason is not cute and fluffy enough for anyone then welcome to eve and either appreciate it or donti dont really caresee my sig for my opinion on other hot topics such as this
i dont mean to distribute nonsense or take part in any dibocals but i do state and here me out i just aquired this character from the forums and was checking out all the post the previous owner had placed so  pleese disregard any old postings of this character for i did not and repeat was not me who partaked in this discussion 
agree
bumpage to get your attention interested in opinions
actually dont give the titan weapons at allallow it to anchor itself where ever and go into this mobile outpost mode and while in that mode it has the cpupowergrid of a medium pos tower while its in siege sentry guns can be anchored around it or any other pos weapons system any number of these systems can be anchored at once up to the starbase defense skill of the anchoring playerdrawback it takes 10m to enter siege and 30m to unsiege once it leaves siege mode anything anchored around it goes into storage mode like an anchored can and can simply be unanchored just like a canthus a titan can anchor itself at a belt have someone deploy a handful of pos guns to kill the spawns and the belt can safely be reduced to so much rubble before moving on to the next or do the same thing at a chokepoint gate to serve as a defensive bastionif the pilot logs off the titan remains where it is in siege mode just like a pos all logistic modules shut down but sentry systems continue to function
i like the concept hastrabull but i would not make the titan immobile in siege mode that makes it useless as noone will risk a titan under those circumstances i would let it use up strontium and give it capital weapons with say a 1000 damagebonus compared to 625 for dreads in siege and without the tracking penalty so it can also hit battleships a real monster but killable and not capable of blowing up a whole fleet with a single push of a button
well making it inmobile was one of the main points titan would change into some sort of outpost but with very high resistanceshp and with huge offensive capabilities bonus to damagetrackingin shortinmobile but hard to destroy and with huge firepower  shelter for smaller ships something similar to command ship from nexus  jupiter incident
i think making it immobile in order to use dd and get decent dps out of its guns is decent maybe just make it use a standard siege module or a titan version that is similar but have it get a higher bonus like malachon said of around 1000 or maybe more dont increase the timer over 10 minutes even at 10 minutes most people will never use their dd make it an hour and you will make the module unusable you could then make the dd render the ship completely inactive for say 30 seconds to a couple of minutes or so all modules deactivate cant move cant warp etc im not sure how these things would balance it some testing would be required
something like this yes
you all suggest the wrong thing titan should be turned into a mobile outpost with defensive capability not offensivetitan can turn into an immobile outpost with huge gang bonuswith shield friendlies can just stay outside the shield and fight if they take damage move in and dock up to repair
id rather have a titan go offline unable to move fire or activate modules for x minutes after firing off a dd
i still like the siege idea into station modeit could anchor anywhere so it doesnt need sovereignty or something as has been suggested before and it also doesnt need a nearby moon or planet also been suggested before id also say that certain systems should only be available in different modes for instance1 people keep complaining of database errors if a titan has passengers docked and it tries to jump so only allow docking while in station mode if it tries to shift back to ship mode then everyone is ejected or it simply cant shift back until everyone has left on their own this might cause problems if a ship is aboard and the titan really needs to leave in a hurry but its your fault for allowing them inside to begin with 2 different weapons systems should only be available in different modes i think the aoe dd could be reserved for station mode as a defense and a new aimed dd could be used for ship mode then it can either stay still and blast the whole battlefield or it can move about and blast individual targets like other titans3 i think that the titan could project its shields around friendlies while in station mode but i wouldnt give it any extra shields during that time either titans already have hundreds of thousands of shield points but it could be an option to protect the fleet while that lasts when the titan is reduced to armor then the fleet hiding under its skirts is vulnerable as well4 one extra tweak i suggest everytime the multiple titans per fleet issue is raised if an aoe dd is used then the area is irradiated and successive dd used in that same area before it is allowed to dissipate will bring detrimental results either the damage suffers stacking penalties or the weapon has a chance of not firing or maybe the weapon delivers the blast back onto the titan either way i think residual energy would be a simple fix to fleets bringing a dozen titans to a fight
if we imagine the local as to the range at wich our own shipradio can hear that system simply hear the space void if noone speak onair you dont hear anything but spacenoise if you speak your voice thorugh the system your words appear but not the list of people only the single phrase you spoke not the list it is stupidso i agree to eliminate localintelmaybe the stargates themselves spread across the system the 11 accessexit ships not the type nor the pilot so you may know how many pilots been there mmm and the jump bridges mmm
i agree with the issues raised about making missions more interesting by randomizing the outcomes to go along i would like to see two changes made to how belt rats work and how npc loot drops both from rats and missions are determined1 belt rats as it stands now if you are in gallente space for example you will only see serpentis rats if you know the security status of the system you can predict down to the ship name what sort of ship you will see the rare exception is faction ships and even those are predictable why is this do sansha or gurista pirates never travel to essence my proposal is to add a random element to the encounter tables to allow a chance for different types of rats to show up also make it possible for more variety of ship type as well like bc rats in a 5 systemthe value would be more variety and less predictability chances to get different types of loot and salvage and motivation for players to work together to take down tougher opponents with smaller ships2 randomize the loot drops all npc loot drops can also be predicted by type and ship strength one of the fun aspects of any game that includes looting is the surprise in what you are going to get in eve you might get a hgher meta level item or the extremely rare faction or officer drops but 99 of the time loot is dull and predictable so much so that many players dont bother same with salvage my proposal is to expand the loot tables to include items like implants usable boosters bpcs rigs and other items outside the list of modules the value would be added excitement to the pve game and more motivation to loot and salvage not to mention more pirating possibilities ar
maybe theres an option i havent found yet but itd be great if mails from insurance andor cloning services could be disabled or at very least if something could be put into place to make sure that we dont get insurance expiration mails for ships weve sold or otherwise lost possession ofits obviously not a very important issue just a minor annoyance from time to time
insurance expiry mails for ships you dont own sounds like a bug  bug report it as for the other you should be able to add npcs to the blocked list just like players
ill make this short and sweetcurrently its possible to use alts on the same account to support an issue while ccp and possibly the csms are capable of seeing how many accounts are behind a specific number of supporting votes this can still be exploited to inflate the number of supporting votes which harms the overall legitimacy of the system and can distort the perspective of players wishing to weigh in on an issue this needs to be fixed as soon as possiblethat is all
im supporting this topic with my main
and now with my alt
supporting this topic again with my main and only character
or maybe youre my other alt its become self aware
some where in the nano threads insanity over the last couple of days in one of the threads here in the assembly hall i believe lavista or maybe it was jade said that ccp is able to look at the tallys on their end on a per account basis i do think though for us the on washed masses it would be nice to see that same per account vote opposed to 3 votes per account mayhem we have right now
hello i too support this planno i am not the alt of the above posterpromiseps you only get to see the one alt the others portrait is soo ugly small children would cry in fright
ok testing this i thought you could only support with 1 char per account
and now with my alt on the same accounteidt hmm works indeed
agreed it should be 1 vote 1 account and transparent to the forum members as well as the folks around the back to avoid inflated bandwagon effects
that must have been jadebut right now i think this is a limitation of the forum system which seem to work on a percharacter basisbut yes i fully agree this is a major flaw it needs to be worked out for the future of csm if ccp wants to have a body like this it will have to be done right the current way isnt
supportin disat least my alts are fairly easy to actually find
i support this topic
supported again
has my full support inflating votes with dummies is something akin to election fraud

you mean people actually take the thumbs up icons seriouslyive so often seen people support an idea but forget to check the little box that i wouldnt even rely on them to get the overall proanti mood of a thread let alone anything approaching a meaningful tallyalthough i suppose people will be more careful to support in threads like the nano onesedit because i forgot to support
the nonerf vs pro nerf no nerf is double  the pro nerfim sure that there was padding on either side but however you cut it more people are voicing to stop the changes than to support them as it doesnt just effect nano shipsits a bad idea and you knows it foo
ummmm you realise that this thread hasnt got anything to do with the nanonerf itself right its to do with the proven flaw in the current system where multiple alts on the same account can voice support for any given issue thus padding the perceived support and increasing the amount of noise created in the thread drowning out any reasonable suggestions for how a given idea could be betterthis was proved as being possible with the first three posts on this thread with tarmanic supporting this with both himself and one of his alts on the same account as tarmanic

stangly enough thought your thread popped up as the nano whiners where loosing the voting war tho ehand  make me
my thread popped up as a response to this thread linkagecheck the timestamps on my first post and this threads creationbesides its extremely likely that both sides are using this tactic it doesnt make it any less dishonest
the fact that players assume that their voting will reverse the changes is misleading the fact that this is in the assembly hall is misleading if all this voting power was spent in testing and giving honest only slightlybiased feedback to what the devs are creating on the test server the antinerf and pronerf crowd might actually have some say in how balanced this change isbut the devs have already stated that its not working as they intend it to work not as how we believe it should work or how we think its fine and their concept for the changesim beating a dead horse again when i say that game development isnt a democracy your not paying to have a product built to your or even a majority of players specifications your paying to buy the product as ccp decides to release it youve got no creative rights or control over said productgood marketing is completely different but if you did win and cause a change youd sure as hell be pssed off when someone else used popular vote from a small minority of the playerbase that is active on the forusm to change something you didnt like better off wed be if we just left it to the guys who are trained and paid to design it as theyre the ones who takes the blame if it lives or diesso vote or not opinion or not the real flaw with this system is player arrogance and misunderstanding
definatly supporting this all you have to do is look at the nano threads and half the chars you see voting against it are characters with no corps and bs names that mean nothing that are a couple weeks old yeaokccp better be able to tell whos on what account if not this is a serious problem and peoples vote doesnt mean hit
and this whcih is about as honest about the whole thing as you can get
i voted with my 14 characters sorry what was the topic againmetagaming if you cant beat them 1 on many outa meta game them whining for when you cant win in game whine for changes and the only counter to a sucessful whine is lots more whining
agreed an align to for every single celestial object in space not only the fleet version
agreedmaybe not all bosses would escape they too have clonesbut some missions that dont require to kill all but to tackle someone or exploring some systems or so totally agreed on removing t1 loot and halving boring frigs
i agreebut we have to remember the loot problem it really kill economy miners and producers right now on some other thread some nice post ask to eliminate loot for scrapping maybe leaving some named t1 mods insignas and quest items and a tiny up on bounty not muchmaybe producing t1 mods will be worth again
i didnt go threw reading it all at work at the moment but i dont think you should remove the quality rating instead make it that once you get to a certain security rating all agents for that empire are equal quality makes something to work for and would still reduce lag spreading out missioners and and still keep the present systemedit  guess this idea was already proposed
i do missions to relax myself i do pvp in nullsec to excite myselfi think its bad to force to go mission runners to lowsec systems where they risk their shipsand it is bad to eliminate missions only because of lag i can ask to eliminate pvp for the same reason dont ino it would be bad to kill missions as it would be bad to kill pvpso aside the omnipresent lag new hardware will help the mission hubs will lose lag only if mission runners will find new systemsi totally agree to clean the laggest systemsone suggestion is to let contact my agents from systems far away from the agent homesystem based on standing a pilot could ask for mission in lowsec simply calling that agent from a lowsec system if my standing will be enough i can even ask my agents for mission in null sec and maybe that mission would be more risky and hardso there will be no need for quality but only level and system security no difference between 10 and 05 really no difference but if im a militian factional warefare mission in enemy systems would paycallin agents from away and nullfing the reward difference between 10 and 05 would kill mission hubs and let enough space for future improvements on the missiongamesystem
we are supposed to be drone specialists after all i propose to reevaluate bandwitdh specs on all gallente boats all gallente battleships should have 125mb drone bandwitdh for a start for a dronespecialised race to have battleships that cant even fit 5 heavy drones just doesnt sit right
gallente can be specced for drones blasters and railguns so no not every bs should be able to fit 5 heavies
gallente have a primary turret weapon like every other race and some of their ships favor that weapon the fact that their ships are split between drone and turret users is not uncommon caldari face the same issue only their weapon split of hybrids and missiles all take up the same highslotsif anything id consider yourself lucky that a large portion of your damage potential in a large portion of your ships do not take slots do not require fittings and dont use cap asking for another boost is like spitting in the rest of our faces
and this could probably be better posted in the gameplay discussion or features and ideas sections
kid there is a drone nerf coming as they are now too good to take out smaller ships compared to 99 of turrets no n in turret
increase for all ships why should gal ships get that regardless if they are the drone race hell amarr ships only get bonus for cap basically means the lasers wont drain the cap that fast and the damage bonus only goes on a few select ships same as resist bonus and rof forgot the abaddon only gets resist and dps bonus apoc gets range and cap use i think i am not a big fan of the bandwidth thing myself but hey  happens and then u adaptwhiner threads
following the same logic caldari can be specced for rails blaster guided missiles and unguided missiles four specializations against 3 not less so for the whining comments
though im a professional drone  i cant support thisdominix 5 hybrid damage per level 10 drone damage per level 6 turrets 5 heavy dronesmegathron 75 tracking per level 5 damage per level 7 turrets 5 heavy droneshyperion 5 damage per level 75 repair per level 8 turrets 4 heavy dronesdps no skills t1  all skills t1  all skills t2dominix 224  679  897 tier one two damage bonusesmegathron 245  613  809 tier 2 one damage and one tracking bonushyperion 247  615  816 tier 3 one damage and one repair bonusthings look pretty good to me the hyperion has an extra turret but loses a single drone its real damage will be a bit lower than the megas due to tracking but the megathron has 2 offensive bonuses while the hyperion has only one offensive bonus so that seems pretty balanced to me theres no good balance reason why the hyperion should have another drone
nice troll
im a massive gallente specialist and even i think this idea is stupid being the drone race doesnt mean that the noob ship should come with fighters and hyperbole aside two gallente bses have 125 of bandwidth and the hyperion is just fine without it
was inspired by yours if you count blastrers and rails as different specializations i can do the same for guided and unguided missiles
heheheh  i guess you could count the combat and sentry drones as different types nobut more accurate would be to say hybrids and drones and hybrids and missiles the two dont equal out though because in the latter case they both take up high slots
fine caldari  hybrids and missiles gallente  hybrids and drones amarr  lasers and drones minmatar  bastard child who uses everything mostly projectile and missiles each race has bonuses focusing on 2 types this is eve university 101 the gallente do not suffer from a specialization deficiency
so really drones should be nerfed aaahhh lock thread
maybe not all but some gallente ships really lost out when drone bandwidth was introduced in particular the ishkur went from a nice ninja ratting ship to a useless piece of crap
then maybe the ishkur deserves some lovin but clearly not all of them  only the droneboats that are shown to be underpowered like your example
gief the eos back the ability to holddeploy 5 heavies nowwwwwwwwwwww
the eos and myrmidon should have lost turret slots not drone bandwidth and yeah the ishkur got hit although not really as hard as those two
the heart of the matter is that you want a dps increase on all gallente battleshipsyour arbitrary definition of drone affinity as being able to fit 5 of the biggest drones is interesting as well compare caldari and gallente and its obvious which race has more emphasis on drones beyond that gallente isnt entitled to anything
because some original person took the time and effort to specialize a character and the other person is paying money or isk for that effort there is a difference in your first example two characters are involved and neither change they just switch ownership the second involves the actual alteration of a character that should remain static i dont think players should have the freedom to move around their skill points at will like musical chairs you can alter your own character by training something else i think thats enough freedom as every character can do anything theres plenty of logic in denying this op
i cant really support this as much as theres a part of me that would like toeve does not have path system that youre locked into where choosing certain skills makes other skills difficult to learn or impossible to learn nor does it have some softcap to total sps where reaching a certain sum total of sps means that you gain sps at a slower rate afterwards for instance just because i have 1500000 sp in missiles does not mean that if i try and buy gunnery skills later on they now cost twice as much sp to level if eves skill system worked that way id support your postit doesnt thoughwhile i dont support the ops request this isnt a good example in wow youre locked into a certain path depending on your choices in eve you are not  there is no mechanic for diminishing returns in other skills because you chose certain skillsim going to guess you dont play other mmos thenive played most major mmo to have come out and quite a few notsomajor ones like this one of those i played all of them had major changes that totally change some classs aspect while you might not know people who played everquest if you do ask them how about necromancers in early eq and what happened to them later try asking someone who plays wow how paladins used to be or how mages used to get an invisiblity and an unlock spell making rogues pointlesspeople are better off in eve than in those games because theres no classes and youre not locked into a certain skillset
its only a matter of time thoseriously i gotta say i cant approve of this idea you make your choices and thats the end of itjust for balance ill point out that i have skirmish mindlinks recons 5 inties 5 hac 5all stuff thats getting massively changed do i want agility bonuses instead of speed bonuses do i s i trained the skills for the speed increase cos i for one hate snailblobtankwars and i fly with some incredibly talented inty pilotsas far as im concerned there should never be any requirement for this kind of respec option as the changes proposed should never be considered minor tweaks for balance as requiredunfortunately thats not the case sadly it seems to me the loudest portion of the playerbase are the ones who have the least clue about the impact of thier screamingeducate those players teach them that the game can still evolve with only minor adjustments and that whatever fotm is currently killing them can be easily balanced if it is unbalanced that is with only minor changes that is going to be a far more valuable and long lasting option than respecing skills
i still want to be able to delete skills
now i dont know if this happens to everyone but it happens to me a lot and its starting to get somewhat irritating most of the time when im getting a storyline mission im looking forward to it till i read the mission details and discover that the mission is about transporting 7500 m3 big cargo or minebuy 10k m3 ores for the faction for war preparation so the faction wont soil itself and die of the humiliation now those missions arent that irritating autopilot something somewhere and get paid for it is easy money aslong as you got the ship for it most of the time im doing commandsecurityanythingthatinvolveskillingothership missions so me having a ship that got a four didgit m3 cargohold number really isnt something i give much attention to what i do give a little attention to however is storyline commandsecurityanythingthatinvolveskillingothership missions but it doesnt seem to me that i get most of those instead i get a boring mission which i need to jump 6 times back and forth 15 times cause the cargohold of my salvaging ship only got enough space for one engineif this is a somehow irritating phenomena that mission runners experience then i believe that storyline missions could be organized in the way that mining missionsers get mining related storyline missions combat missionsers get combat related storyline missions and so onanyways thats just methanks for your attentionady
just so ya know the missions you get are determined by the department that the agent works with so if you want lots of fighting missions work for a command or security agent and now a manufacturing or research agent dont know for sure if the militia agents are broken down this way but i bet they are
the cynical perspective of factional warfare prior to its release was that it would be some sort of pvp lite ive been bopping around the gallente militia for a few days and i dont think this is true what it is is alliance lite the militia is functionally similar to an alliance but without leadership or organizationthere are problems though with an alliance without a head internal issues arise complaints of lootstealing bickering between corporations culminating in intramilitia wardecs and arguments over militiawide strategy and tactics theres no authority to settle internal disputes so the disputes continue and theres no authority either to level punitive measures against players or corporations who persist in causing problems for the militia theres no guarantee beyond an implied agreement that were even all fighting for the same isidei there needs to be some way for the militia to deal with problem members and problem corporations and in less extreme cases to function as the last word in intramilitia disputes authority would also help on an organizational level the ability to designate short term goals and provide some mandate for the activities of militia members would help on several fronts it would give the militia especially new players who arent entirely sure of their direction or purpose something to concentrate on it would also allow the disparate elements of the militia the pveers who dont really want to get involved in pvp and the pvpers who dont want to do plexes to cooperate on a more meaningful level if the goal this week is to decontest fliet then the folks wondering what they should be doing know that they should be heading to fliet and doing the complexes there and the folks doing pvp fleets know that the other side will be drawn to that system like flies to honey and will know where to concentrate their effortsorganization will also help another problem which is the lack of fcs the militia channel is always full of people xing up for whatever group will have them but fleet commanders willing to take a group under their wing are significantly less common at most there tends to be one large blobly fleet in the warzone and then usually only when an opposing fleet has already been spotted having goals handed down from onhigh will give people a better idea of what they need to do which will hopefully result in more people being willing to step up to the plate and take command of a fleetso having a system of leadership in the militia would help keep deal with intramilitia squabbling and help give players purpose
heres how i propose to do it  individuals are chosen to fill specific roles in the militia by a vote corporations each get a vote and the militia corporations members all vote individually to determine the militia corporations vote alternately a corporation is chosen in a similar manner and their ceo becomes something akin to an alliance executor the militia leader has the power to kick corporations from the militia for a period of time or individuals from the militia corporation he doesnt have to approve applications the militia will remain open to anyone who wants to join booting a member or corp from the militia will require a vote from existing militia corporations the boot will not be permanent  possibly it could simply entail dropping the corporationplayers standings which would necessitate regaining standings to rejoin the militia  if rewards for fw are implemented the militia leader may be able to put players or corporations on a probationary status and dock them a percentage of their rewards the militia leader has the power to designate a system or systems as conquest goals this could be handled in a few different ways either single systems or up to three adjacent systems or up to three nonadjacent systems or single constellations victory points in these systems are gained at a higher rate than in other systems for both sides standing increases for vp gain and kills are also higher in these systems than in others this doesnt function as a tremendous incentive without faction pvp rewards but even without them it gives the militia some focus even simply giving lps to players who score kills in the goaled systems might work  the systems designated by the opponents militia leader as conquest goals become defensive goals with similar mechanisms play since all of the systems have multiple capture points this would help decrease blobbing somewhat simultaneous strikes on multiple points mean that the blob cannot be everywhere at once at present blobbery hasnt been cut down upon because the points are spread across dozens of systems and the prize the fleets chase is the enemy fleet bringing the conflict down to a couple systems at a time might help this and bring fw specific mechanics further into playat present the main problem facing factional warfare is the lack of coherence within militias corporations may be organized but the militias as a whole arent theres a significant power vacancy from the fleet commander level upwards and the militia is really feeling that where it hurts simply sticking someone at the top and giving him basic levels of authority would help this tremendously and might help make factional warfare the interesting variant of pvp it was meant to be
edit op fixed this
should solve that problem and having someone at the helm to make the decision and then having people need to ratify it will work better i think than a straight democracy also it wouldnt be too hard to put in safeguards to prevent bootery enmasseedit hah nevermind then but the democratic vs ratification thing is important enough that im leaving my post here
signed to everything he saidfw has no internal controls over its militia members other than normal corporation management features this is not enoughthere exists a need to handle wardecs standings across all of the faction and fleet management recognizing fcs is one thing but having fleet features where there are designated fleets in place and people can simply sign on without xng all of the time is a welcome idea whose time has comeextend control in the areas that need it and release control for the sore points ccp needs to get in touch with all of the visibly prominent corporations that are trying to organize things across all of these frontsccp or any member of the csm please take heed the playerbase as a whole may not know how to articulate into words what is required or even be 100 consciously aware of the issues at stake but there are a large number of us that do please talk to us
op suggestionsall non corporate militia members 1 collective vote each corporation independently by the number of players even 1 1 votealliance like politics games to be added to militia play with giving some people the power to ban others from the militia and it will abused as a tool against specific corporationsdictator like militia ceo with the power to set goalsto all the abovenothe militia is not a 00 alliance and should not be ruled as one quoting some little pearl open to exploitation
this can be abused in so many ways just one example would be for an alliance to seed the militia of thier choice with a bunch of alts and members then vote one of thier own into control leaving themselves with thier own little personal militiathe other problem is how do you make sure the vote is fairone vote per person the largest corp in the militia winsone vote per corp the largest corp in the militia still wins all they need to do is have each member start thier own little temporary corp join the militia and vote
there are simple safeguards that can be put in place to keep people from flooding the militia with alt corpplayers for instance weve got a ranking system    why not weigh votes by rank you can flood the militia with a bunch of rank 0 alts but they wont be able to swing an election the need to ratify decrees means that this is not an 00 dictatorship its a cooperative effort but what the effort lacks now is iinitiativei and thats what putting someone at the helm gives us it gives us people actively making decisions that the rest of us can yay or nay to instead of us all sort of sitting around in a mob grumbling about how someone should be doing something second point larger corporations have more power thats how a democracy works the danger of having the people make the decisions is that theres a constant danger of more people who arent you making decisions you dont want either we can have a democracy which apparently we dont want or we can have a dictatorship which we dont want either or we can have anarchy which weve got and is frustrating we can put safeguards in place to prevent corpspawning to prevent altspamming and to prevent an 00 alliance moving in wholesale and shutting the place down if you have better ideas on how to do this feel free to speak up but folks this is exactly the problem weve got with the militia now no ones in charge and a significant minority cant wrap their minds around the idea of being constructive the militia needs leadership and if you dont like my proposal i would ireally reallyi like suggestions about how militia leadership could be better implemented because we need something oh and the other solution is to ask to have ccp put someone in charge but    folks this is eve the whole game is arguably about players governing themselves  is fw really such a joke that we need to carebear up the leadership too
i would like to see a race specific bonus implemented that way any minmatar born clone flying a minmatar ship will have specific racial bonusesexampleminmatar racial bonus can be 10 bonus to ship speedcaldari racial bonus can be 10 missile bonus of some descriptiongallente racial bonus put towards dronesamarr racial bonus to capacitorthese bonuses can be worked out amongst the ccp thinktankscheers chelly
first i think this is more for features and discussions than the assembly hallsecondly one of the prime factors about choosing a race is that it gives you no bonuses were all equal its the skills we train and the ships we decide to flydoes that mean the idea is bad no but theres something counterproductive about being a minmatar for example and not using your speed bonus to stack with your ships speed bonus specialization beats out generalization any dayso i support moving this idea to its proper forum and i dont support adding bonuses to races unless you give amarr a 10 bonus to armor resists then i fully support it j
we already have racial specific bonusesthey are found at character creation in the form of what starting skills and attribute balance you have at intial character creationso no i dont support your idea
if you give bonuses to people based on their character race you will  off a large portion of the player base because the race their character is doesnt have the bonus they want the older the character the more ed they areadd in the bonuses only working if your flying your races ships and you  of everyone who wants to fly ships of multiple racesthis is the kind of change i would leave the game over because it forces me to chose between throwing away a character ive had for a while putting up with the fact that i will never be able to pilot a gallente ship as well as the players who got lucky or leaving eve
you should still be able to get the skill and ship specific bonuses if you choose to fly another races ship what im getting at is this2 ravens shape up for a 1 v 1pilot 1 is amarrpilot 2 is caldarii think pilot 2 should have just the smallest advantage to his raven as he is caldarithere are plenty of nerfs that  pilots offin the end its to make life a little more interesting not easier as easier is often boring
the op is right in a manner of speaking if you look through the data dumps youll see racespecific bonuses not far off what the op suggestshowever eve is all about redemption you have to take yourself very far down one path until youre not able to come back faction standings applying a limit to characters at their birth goes way against thissaying that i would like to see more racial difference whether that be racespecific ships or militiaonly reward ships for highranking officers which are returned if they leave the militia then its all good
what a terrible idea
this is just a bad idea sadly it sounds good on paper but really the skills you get starting out should cover this but beyond that everyone should be equaloh its great if you happen to play amarr with an amarran character but what happens in the future when the amarr are nerfed or you start out playing caldari because they sound like awesome miltarists then you find out about the truth about missiles and pvpright now one of the big insurance policies in eve is that even if some favorite tactic  races ships  skills are nerfed you can always just learn new skills without being inherently disadvantaged compared to someone else who was just born better who will stay better forever
no eve prides itself on letting everyone do everything equally well as long as they put the same amount of time into it i was completely against chargenonly skills and im most definitely against this
i prefer the existing system anyone can do anything given enough time
it is a terrible idea what makes eve great is its flexibility you are for all intents and purposes a tabula rasa as john locke put it you fill it with whatever you want complete freedomwhats your suggesting creates classes classes  bad
it was stealth nerfed during the expansion release and i bug reported it shortly afterno response yet on the bug report nor a simple database hotfix so theyve seen how effective logis are with remote energy xfer and made it impossible for anyone other than bpo holders to produce t2 versionsthe bug report
 you are not authorized to view this bug report 
what seems to be the problem here sir
i agree that some of the nerfs may be a little overboard i dont fly nanoships but ive said it before ill say it again nerfing the crap out of something is the laziest way to fix a perceived problemtbh your ideas along with some buffs to either tracking on some ships or missile explosion velocity and missile velocity on others or both would serve the playerbase much better to combat ships that are currently invulnerable due to their high speeds
if your intent on seeing any balance to the nerf get on sisi and test it to death report your findings dont go all opinionated and believe it or not devs will listenprove to them that your taking too much damage from missiles prove to them that your getting locked down too hard but whether your arguing for or against the nerf unless your actually contributing to make the changes the devs have already decided to make balanced all your doing is blowing smokedont try vetos and votes like you think this is some kind of highschool popularity contest test report and test again if you dont do your part to help bring balance youve got no right to yell about ccp not listening
ok veto it keep your 7ks ishtarbut give us the guns to hit you in the face with when your doing max speed
these changes are dispicable repugnant and lack any intellectual direction they are counter to small game combat display a complete lack of understanding by the devs about pvp and are a complete capitualation to the whining drake caracal raven crowd the worst things every forced down the throats of players and could possibly result in the first serious decrease in the viability of eve as an entertainment product

just some place to discuss progression of faction wars
make alliances cheaper to startmaintain as things are many corps cannot get access to 00 space as existing alliances will not recruit allow them access my corp has been trying to get into a 00 alliance but no one will have us we cannot hope to take on an alliance to gain space so what do we do to get into 00 obviously we do not want to join another corp we have the corp we want already ccp wants people to expand into 00 yet makes it almost impossible
yes they are boring maybe its possible to reimburse them fairly howeverno you are not forced to train themno they are not so tedious if you do a little math with marginal returns see evemon if you cant do the simple economic analysis yourselfyes you can replace the attributes but what about reallocating the sp and time spenti think its enough that the tier2 learning skills can be started upon completion of the teir1 at level iv thats very very lenient to begin with learning skills provide a way to customize your character and allow himher to grow intellectually learning skills are a healthy introduction to the patience required in the unique skill system of eve
even ccp refered to them as a boring grind
i already accounted for that in my postthey dont customize your character at all because basically everyone trains them because they are universally necessary yet again it doesnt add anything to the game except force newbies to waste time before training anything usefulwouldnt a better introduction just be letting people see the skill system for themselves rather than a wowesque grind for a load of time before you can do anything useful
it does not force new players to do anything most people who dont understand the system do all their skills to iviii because they are told to it is possible to get you basic skills without bringing your learning up to ridiculous levelsinstead oflearning ilearning iilearning iiibeginner skillsadvanced skillstry thislearning skills ibeginner ilearning iibeginner iiadvanced ilearning iiibeginner iiiadvanced iietcit isnt a grind when done properly and efficiently if eve does one thing well it teaches players the basics of diminishing marginal returns having high learning skills is only worthwhile when training those ivv skills players benefit by learning to prioritizeagain you dont have to grind you can plan it properly so its not such a terrible obstacle if a player chooses all of his attributes at the beginning either one of two things would happen1 ccp would make sure all of the bloodlines are balanced so each has an equal opportunity to specialize in anything as they do now no fun in picking a bloodline2 ccp would keep the bloodlines separate newbie who doesnt understand the game picks the bloodline with all the charisma and realizes since the attributes are at a high level and he cant add any to perception and intelligence he trains slowly for everything important and quitsi had a longer post with more math for this second part let me know if you want to see it
i beg to differ a bit they do customize your character especially for those who are dedicatedinsane enoungh to train up 5376000sp in learning skills customized how you may ask customized in the fact that i am able to out skill those fellow eve pilots who started around the same time as me yes it is a long time to pay off learning everything to lvl5 in learning even the advanced ones but i am going to be in this game long enough for it to pay offeve is not about instant gratification eve is about dedication and long term commitment to goals maybe that is why when i was still a nubbin of my first 5m sp 35m sp of it was in learning for some people that may be too slow to get real skills but i used that time to actually learn about the game reading faqs the forums guides and joining a corp where i got to learn a bit about all aspects of evefor the record you dont need to have much sp to be effective you just need to be cunning i only once pirated and it was when i was a week old and in a punisher in low sec i had less than 500k sp at that time but i still got me 10m for ransomalso for the record yes i really am sick and have the aforementioned 5376000sp in learning skillstldr versioneve is not the instant gratification you seek learning skills are worth it if you have the paitencedo not support
i think learning is fineyou either do them or you dont the obligation to do them is all in your headwhat i do want to see is the adv learning skill itself
learning skills are a great aspect to the game learning skills actively encourage newer players to be responsible with their skill training and show how rewarding time management can be
nullthis
go here for the previous thread every aspect of it gets debated to death
the entire vote is bullsht and im not saying that because im in support of the nerf or against i could care less because my perception of balance is completely differentbut when the hell was it the players with no programing experience and no real concept of how the game worked behind the game screen that they see who decided what changes the developers madei mean come the fck on they were taking votes before the test server was up and testing is going on and changes are already coming down taking the testing into accountbut im so amazed at how arrogant players can be your not paying to have this game built to your specifications you know your paying to play the game as the developers choose to deliver it going off on a vote or crying for nerfanti nerf threads on the forums is hopefully completely ignored by the playerbasebecause guess who will never take accountability if a poor decision is made off their own complaints the playersif the servers crashed and could not be repaired because players were pushing the game engine to limits it couldnt handle with a particular mixture of modules boosters rigs implants and skills it damn sure wouldnt be those who used those tactics who would raise their hand and say my faultand the same goes the other way if thousands of players were lost because of a massive nerf of an entire playstyle its not going to be the whiners who claim the blameit all goes onto the developers shoulders let them design their game throw an idea out every now and then but until you are paid to make the code yourself dont assume that you should have any say your power is simple and easy to use pay the monthly fee or dontif you pay you like what ccp does if you leave you donteasy now can we all get over this crap
yay anubis xians sales alt on same account
anubis xians ceo alt on same account
yeah that seems broken to me
hehehe  read the posts ive posted with all my accounts several trial accounts and in both sides with various alts on each of these accountsif that doesnt invalidate those bs up in arms comments ive lost respect for the ccp dev team
one account one votean answer was given in there by inanna zumi that the csmccp could see the number of individual accounts supporting a given issue however this doesnt help when people are blitzing a given issue with all of their alts in this case the nanonerf both for and against it and claiming that support as an overwhelming mandate for change given that the general eve population cannot see the account support just the number of thumbs
dont want this to drop off the front page for too long players might forget that they have no say in key development decisions other than their right to pay for the game as it is delivered or notand of course we all know that that would be a horrible world full of forum politics whines and counterwhines and annoying threads like the very one your reading basically forum hell
yet before salvage it wasnt their income since salvage is a relatively recent addition i wonder if the changed probing system came out at the same time as salvagethis would mean that the ability to salvage other peoples missions would have been started at the same time as salvage
personally i dont really care if they take the learning skills out or leave them in though taking them out would cause some major headaches and what not what i would like to see though is the time it takes to train from 4 to 5 reduced 30 days to train a skill is just plain silly knock 2550 off that training time and imo things would go much smoother there would be a lot of gripes and whinging from older players but whatever happens someone is gunna complain
neither evelyn beatrice hall nor voltaire who she was describing when she said that were american youre missing the point nobody is asking for special treatment its just that its neither appropriate nor fair to make assumptions or assertions about someone based on some unrelated category they happen to fit into if i call you stupid because of something you did thats one thing although still rather rude but if i call you stupid because of where you were born and thereby call every single other person who was born there stupid by implication thats beyond the palewere a private community here theres absolutely nothing wrong with expecting certain minimum standards of behavior in the community if you really cant stop yourself from being openly and aggressively racist homophobic misogynistic or whatever nobody is stopping you were just saying dont do it hereif it makes you feel better ill fight to the death for your right to start your own forum and say what you like there
its ok to be bigoted in game right like my caldari character is a racist against minmatar scum

im a newbie i started playing this game last september or was it october anyway i played the game for about a month and quickly got bored of it i thought eh all this skill training crap is too boring thats saying something im normally patient so about ten months later i had a conversation with a guest customer i work at target who plays eve the advice he gave me was to slow down on the learning skills and train in stuff that you think would be fun im glad i talked to him because im having more fun with eve now than i had months ago so just to reinforce what a lot of people are sayingdont take away skills just educate newbies on doing whats fun rather than shoving learning skills down their throats when they are necessary they can always be returned to later
35 pages of do not want thereyou have no idea what you are talking about just stop typing
some thoughtsfirst to ankh on the slap on the wrist players found the issues you brought to ccp to be important some had been asked for or about for a long time with no feedback with the csm we get feedback ccp wanted big things and that is what they got they just did not have the same idea of what was a big thinglavistai am in agreement with you on ship balancing it seems to me that all you will see here is opinions on those ships and their value having the csm spending time on debating if this ship or that needs a reassessment is a down right waste all ship balancing needs to start out with a look at the database by ccp to see what warships those ships that have use in combat are used or not which are primaried popped first would be a good statistic which are ignored and which are left back in a hanger nothing to do with the csm hereone of the above posts said a reply only forum is a good idea dev asks the question why are crows left in the hanger when other interceptors are out fighting i picked a crow because i can spell it not because its bad where a ship the database says is not used as it should be or a whole class of ships are left out of the fights filter delete all the troll posts and go from there nothing for the csm except perhaps for the nebulous there have been multiple posts aimed at balance issues please let us know what you are doing about itccp wants the csm to look at big issues but like so many things big is a matter of perspective battleships look big if you are in a frigate but very small if you are in a titan
perhaps remand ship balancing issues to other forum sections and let it stand in queue
this is something ive been griping about for quite some time right now i use a destroyer to salvage missions works great until it gets full then i have to dock or pop a can and come back for it in a hauler wasting a lot of time an industrial or barge of some sort would be nice heres my concept  thats my concept

just rewrite the ui so we can drag windows like chats fleet market etc outside eves main window something like tool and palette windows in photoshop 1920 or 1680 resolution would be large enough for eve if one could get all those secondary windows outta the way and keep only the overview and ship hud in the main window
yes please
signed
eve absolutely needs native multimonitor support unless it would cause server lagyes you can already stretch eve over monitors with hardware but to clarify its a function of your video card and its video driver not the eve client  if we could unhinge parts of the ui size the screen to what we want and put ui read overview market window etc items where we want while changing the center point  eve would be much more awesome than it already is but fix lag in massive fleet battles first
i was just talking to one of the goon fcs about cap training and when i said i was planning on training minmatar caps he laughed i loved my scimitar and remote repping in hostile situations is fun for me so i figured the nid wouldnt be too bad however my first time trying to make a nag fit in eft my jaw dropped being able to fit the 4 weapons siege mod and one boosterr or repper with little cpu left over is pretty pathetic especially given the fact that their damage output is so low nag pilots would be forced to shield tank so they can fit damage mods to increase their damage the fix i thought to myself was exactly what yorda suggested minus the 33 turretmissile idea im allfor 3 turrets and no missiles however changing the nag and the nid to shield tankers would balance the shieldarmor tanker capitals hopefully this issue will be addressed before i have to train for dreads
these slot arrangement needs to be more specialised
i dont think that black ops bs will ever eclipse capitals ever in any category and that right now they are just big expensive toys that need a big boost the sins bonus isnt useful panthers is kinda funny and gimmicky while the redeemer and widow remain most useful in my opinion giving the panther a range bonus and the sin a rep amount bonus would make those ships more useful but those are just a few quick ideas i came up with on the spot the most glaring weakness as i see it is that the fuel bay is too small as discussed ships that emerge from being bridged are not cloaked recons stealth bombers covops are all pretty fragile and that ships that need to launch a covert cyno need cyno theory 5 which isnt that big of a deal but it is a pain to trainedit upon reading waxaus post i like his idea of giving the ships an ew bonus but not as strong as the recon equivalent maybe 23 and giving them a covops cloak capacity they shouldnt replace recons but they should also fit along their scheme
against in its current formits too extreme too cataclysmic too soe likeyes that is a grave insult to ccp to compare a move of theirs to soeid rather see a nerf that affects the high end cruisers going freaking 10k but leave reasonable fits alone say 35k these changes are going to make reasonable setups cost billions because it seems to be balanced based on people fitting crazy stuff i also disagree vehemently with the webifier nerf wtf nerf the only thing that currently can be used to break nanosthe mwd change is just ed a t2 mwd should be faster than a t1 ditto faction and officer onesalso i disagree with giving warp scrams the ability to also shut off mwds that makes one module way too powerful if you want to add that ability to a scramdisruptor module it should be via script so that you have to load either warp scram or mwd scram scriptwebs also should be scripted one for strength another for longer range at the expense of strength

well i have tested it and some parts of the change are ok such as the changes to afs and i dont mind the changes to scrams either but the changes to webs and speed are to muchwith the web changes every gallente blaster boat has to fit mwd scram and web disruptor is no longer an option because you have to be able to deactivate your opponents mwd to be able to stay in range becuase webs dont slow things down enough anymore the problem with that though is if you are going up against a blaster boat all you need is ab scram and web and you can dictate range easily because you cut there mwd and will have more speed than them with the ab and the web wont slow you down enough to keep you in blaster range that longalso with the changes missiles get a massive boost over turrets one situation i noticed was with drones drones when webbed at close range are still quick enough to get under your tracking ive got virtualy max gunnery skills and when flying an astarte i was being attacked my 10 hammerheads t2 seen as they was the only things doing dmg to me i decided to try and kll them but i found even when webbed they still manage to orbit me at close range and make it virtualy impossible to kill them which isnt a problem for missile shipsalso the changes seem to cater towards numbers  skill alliances who can put out large numbers with high skilled pilots will like these changes but smaller alliances who rely on hit and runs and picking off large blobs will suffer missile spam on sisi is the iwin at the min this was evident when i flew into the cruisers ffa and just watched cerbs ripping everything apart from whatever range they wantedvagas seem pathetic on the test server ive soloed 2 in my jag and astarte perhaps part of it was down to bad piloting but there has been other instances where all ship types are ripping vagas apart easily curses are ok 1v1 or if you can dictate range but they are awfuly slow now and cant tank at all and rapiers and huginns were getting ripped apartoverall i think the changes to speed is too much you say they are broken becuase missiles and drones cant hit them but if missiles can hit them doesnt that mean that missiles are the superior weapon choice becuase they can do everything the web changes is way to harsh and realy is a big change in gameplay maybe knock it down 10 but the current change is way to much the scram change offers a new style of play and is another way to counter nanos but becomes almost a must fit module combined with the other changes which is somthing ccp say they dont want speed nerf and web nerfs need throwing out and maybe just reducing speed by alittle is all the is needed and the scram boosts along with the boosts to afs are the only things needed to be introduced
holy batman wall of text u got there
i dont like this plan it is not structured eventhough the objective is really clear and well stated the plan doesnt follow a structured path from the objective to solutions but simply jumps from the objective to solutions it is not focused it seems to me like a bunch of ideas thrown there for the only reason that they can imply some changes to speed indeed the plan affects too many different things nerfing even webifiers that is the natural counter of nanoscome on ccp this is the result of a coffebreak brainstorming i know you can do better than thisim against this specific plan of nerfing nanos while im pro a smart way to avoid reaching too fast speedst

we tried blaster ships a lot and if anything they are better than before so i am not sure where you are comming from on thati was shooting drones no problem either  but if your setup makes that hard use your drones on their dronesi dont understand your claim that some ships cant tank at all eitherthere are some awesome tank fits for some of those ships but people are trying to use them how they used to and then moaning it doesnt workmissiles need adjusting a bit not much though a small tweak on explosion velocity should do it i agree however that does not make the changes bad in general

i can see where you got the idea that having t2 frigates for all the hulls would be nice but i dont think remote repping is the way to go t1 repping cruisers like the osprey exequror and augoror would outperform your variants with less training

signedthis change has forced one of my three accounts into expiration i cant play with currency only isk and the isk cost increase has forced me to lose an account as i do not make enough extra isk to cover it
so ccp tells the csm and us the players that a price increase is not within the pervue of the csm i guess that is a little nicer than ccp saying stfu plebs pay it and like it but the end result is the same isnt itwhat i find extremely telling about this issue is ccps unwillingness to talk about it or even allow discussion of the topic to me this translates to they are screwing us they know they are screwing us and they dont even feel obligated to admit it talk about learning in nouncertain terms where you stand with a companyoh for the record i support the op and a full disclosure of this subject by ccp i also fully support and request a return of further options to the gtc ie 30 day 90 day 120 day etc not that we are going to get any of these things after over five years i am fully aware that ccp is not in the business of keeping their customers happy or of being responsible to them in any waysupport

this is the issue that has come the closest to making me leave the gamewar decs keep me from playing when i want to play and doing what i want to do merely because i dont always have the time or resources to make sure id be safe in the location where i would be playingcurrently the only solution for this is for me to eternally stay in a npc corp which is just ed and frustratingwhat id really like is for concord to only allow empire fighting if the war is mutual  as it is now the system is basically the same as if i went up to a police officer and said i hate this person so i am going to kill them and merely because i told the police i wanted to kill someone they respond ok no problem go ahead what the hell as for war decs being necessary to attack logistics chains this is already not the case as many many people have neutral hauling alts to get around this aspect of it right now the war dec system is just a way to force many people to pay for two accounts

how about remove local in low sec  null sec but leave the same as it is now in high secbest of both worlds  pvp  pirate crowd is happy and the carebear crowd is unaffected
removing local flat out is a bad idea until they improve scanningmake it constellation
it is not so cut and dry i think local is fine
yeah so do i m8 but figured i would find a happy middle of the road i can see how it really plays a part in low sec  null sec

an easy solution is just making ppl not appear in local chat until they vocalize themself with a chat messageelse make it possible to disable local chat so that you cant see it and no one else can see you since you arent in that channel simply not joining the local channel unless you want to
i think your incorrect it is reported to your computer displaying the information is just flipping a flag completely stripping it out would require a much more concerted effort and probably a lot of programming time that could be better used on other aspects of the gamejust like one alliance first hacked and got the standings in the local window and then we all got it because it was an unfair advantage this is pretty much the same thing thats why ccp has never removed it except for that hiccup once upon a time they cant figure out how to do so economically personally many of those calling for removal of local will not find the situation they want if it is removed it would actually make the game harder for both the hunted and the hunter the hunted would most likely retreat to empire if they leave hi sec it will be only to do exploration sites and generally in groups becasue any other activity would just be to dangerous theyll either look to stay in npc corps to avoid war declares or gravitate to that as the hunters become more bored in low and 00 sec and look to empire for targetsthe hunters would become bored because of decreasing targets in both cases ultimately folks would probably leave the game faster than the current averageit would probably lead to a slow decline of the game at best and at worst a very drastic decline of the game as what happened to swg
leaving local chat a recent chat is the best e easy way imho evolving che scan system will be needed of coursei dont think it will become boring we speak about pvp in general not only 1vs1 so you need a fleet and an organization and so eliminating local intellychat would improve cooperations some explore to hunt down some gate camp not simply wait at gates or at belts to kill people camping is not pvp imhoeven now people remain in game corp to not risk a war so changing the local system would not alter their gameplay and a recent chat wouldnt hurt themleave the possibility to drop probe and scan pos would render hunting people fun and easy freighter fleet in null sec doesnt change becouse you have to have a recon ship in fleet to scan gate and system ahead so whats the difference only that you will not have the exact number and name of people in system today noone could stealth himself without a cloacking device from au away this is a mess maybe some powerful ships would emit so much emnoise to speak loud in local chat but what for a ship shutten down whit all systems off the tactical sceniarios would be really vast 
i dont think this is a very good ideayou can want to change this so it doesnt show anyone in local but dont go whining in cp when someone sneaks up on you and pops youdoing this would also make it much more difficult to tell if there are pirates in the areawar targetsalliance and corp membersit would make being in system a terrifying experience for some and a rush for othersleave it be
eh not so sure while it is used as a tactical tool by people the potential victims could easily use it the other way around the pirates use local to see who is in system the victimes can use it to see who is yellow flashy red
the bolded mostly but this entire post in general also states while its not the best idea and since you are here saying how its being used as a tactical tool im assuming your a non pvper and if this was implemented you would go whine on cp very quickly because at least local gives you the opportunity to scout for potential dangers like you most certainly do now but you probably dont realize it and if you dont well you better start i do it without thinking and fate decides to punish me when i dont apparently the caldari have been camping neutral systems concord interbus in gallente high sec most of the time i check local make a quick scna down to make sure no reds or war targets pop up or people i know so i can start a conversation with them anyway im gonig to my corp and im in my little salvage boat destroyer and i come out of local and see what systems i will be passing through it was a 12 jump journey and i didnt check local im in the star map and boom one of the caldari militia is camping the gate im in star map and hear the locking sound and think oh well its a noob who thinks he can kill me or someone did it by accident then the ship starts shooting me and it is then i realize its a wt and i didnt check local and look what happened he shot me to like 50 structure before i got to the gateso start using local to your advantage instead of finding a way around it which you are going to regret anyway
i disagree
support in theory the exact roll out would need a lot of work though
making local a recent speakers channel would also mean it cannot be utilized as a tactical tool
i love this idea this would have covop frigates in higher demand and can let said covops and recons scout without being known having it be in delayed mode would still allow people to talk to each other but their presence would still be hidden until they decide to reveal it
no local so when my mate jumps into a system im in someone whom i may not seen for a whilewho is in a different corp or alliance and we may even be at war with each othermeans we can no longer pass the time of day with plesantries or smack how against the ethos of eve friendships begin and are formed through the local channelno longer being able to exchange a few words with passing pilots is a massive down side to losing local a second is when chasing enemy gangs it will be harder to track them down and follow because not every alliance has the numbers of goonswarm who could in therory place a covert ops pilot on every gate to moniter commings and goingsi believe local is a vital aspect of this game
if you read the thread youd see that people have suggested using constellation chat as autoupdating and you can chat in there
dont have constalation channel active have enougth without it
thats as useful an argument as the other folks who say if you dont like local then turn it offthe point is constellation chat spans too great a distance as far as people are concerned they dont use it because they dont want to juggle all the conversations to look for anyone speaking directly to themlocal covers that area right there so you can gab with whoever you like and if you happen to notice someone threatening then you can take appropriate actionwhat isnt factored in is the ships onboard sensors theres no particular reason why you should know the instant someone jumps into the area i dont think that ships have little beacons that ring the doorbell and cry out honey im homebut thats exactly what were calling a problem when a spy wants to sneak unseen into enemy territory to spy on the gathering fleetill just creep up to this gate hopefully no one is on the other end either way ill cloak as soon as i get there and sneak up to viewing range of their pos just gotta make this jump first honey im homeso taking local away from everyone who is abusing it as a tactical intel tool really shouldnt affect you who are only looking to gab with friends you can just as easily ask anyone around here know where to find a villard wheel without seeing the faces of the people who will want to hurt you for askingand as for knowing if friends or enemies are nearby theres that little button for onboard scanner too
that may be we dont know how ccp would implement it the standings data was always available to anyone by doing a get info on the portrait in local do you see any hacks that give a listing of all ships in system beyond the 13au range of your ships scanner is it because theyre not thereone of the points of this change is to make the game more complex if that means harder for you then thats a subjective assessment
interesting topic nice to see these are being looked at a few things ill comment oncomponent manufacturingread this a few times before and does sound appealing i like the idea of manufacturers being able to specialise in a field of manufacturing if components were required such as components for afterburners would be completely different to say railguns of course adding new skills would be needed so long as there arent a huge amount of them or highly ranked as for making higher meta items would be nice being able to possibly create them with some extra bits but as to how either extra items or buying a bpobpc from lp store etc would be interesting to seeship variationalso sounds good depending on what variations we have as a guess maybe gallente ships could have things oriented to drones blasters and speed perhaps or anything even shieldmissile variants but would it affect the actual amount of rig slots available since we have 3 for t1 ships and 2 for t2 ships might be a toss up between having a boost to your ships inherent bonuses example a dominix variant could get 20 drone damagehp per bs level with or without penalty to something else or using normal rigs of course would there be a way of adding more rig slots considering the rig fitting window has about 8 slots maybe variants could have more rig slots as well should be fun either wayt2 bposi wouldnt like to see them seeded on the market at all nor do i want to see the return of the lottery however i would like to see t2 bpos issued from either a rd corps lp shop specific to race so amarr rd corps would see lasers crystals amarr drones armour repairers and hardeners for example for a high lp cost the better the item will obviously cost you more lp or you exchange your rp for a bpo in that case a nanite engineering agent could offer you an expander ii bpo and any other bpo that requires nanite engineering for x amount wouldnt be a mass amount of bpos available but would also put invention in a bit of a pickle a third option would be to have a corp based rp store much like the lp store for corps so if you have 4 rd agents for one particular rd corp it would be counted as a single rp store where your combined rp from all fields would go towards various t2 bpos and their components and limited then by raceon a similar theme maybe its time to take a closer look at science jobs in stations and the general lack of meplcopy slots from highsec all the way to npc nullsec and how more people can use them without the need of getting a pos perhaps with standings for that corp you have your own private set of slots and gain more as your standing rises such as 2 of any slot type for standings around 400 and working up to about 5 or 6 nearing 900 standing could tie in faction standing to it as well perhaps who knows either way needs to be looked at more especially if all these new si changes will come abouthighsec woesthis in all fairness will probably always be an issue for myself i have no business in lowsec because its not that great compared to what i can do in highsec along with some unnecessary risks that some folks dont want to take i believe many people prefer nullsec 00 over lowsec i for one do anyway much bigger rewards there but at a risk which im willing to take how to go about making lowsec more popular i dont really know but perhaps something that can appeal to both our combat and noncombat pilots out there fw isnt really the answer but at least helped itwell thats all should be fun to see what happens to all these and look forward to seeing how these might be applied
i am all for supporting the high sec based players and promoting their fun in the game i do like pvp and i am member of a pvp 00 alliance however i really find carebearing also to be fun for limited amount of time in the office every daythere is no need to add content to high sec aspect of eve what it needs is challenge honestly what this side of the game needs is challenge its not challenging enough to manufacture something you can build a bs in a few weeks after you start your industrial character and in a year or a bit more you can actually produce the t2 equivalent provided you follow the whole chain youself research getting funds to buy bs bpos invention etc in two years you can build almost all capital ships the main problem is that you can do that on your own invention was supposed to fill that hole but honestly its just tedious and just promotes the use of science alts that never get played its not challenging per sewhat 00 dwellers seek out there is not so much pvp or fame but the structured environment in which to interact with other players and accomplish a common goal kick bobs or ncs butt for example believe it or not camping a gate for four hours just to get podded in helllag has its perverse moments of fun thats where the challenge iswhy not give the same thing to high sec dwellers  make it so difficult to build a single t1 bs that at least 10 people have to work together by making it so that it needs a hundred different components ten of each cheap to produce but requiring too many slots for a person with just 3 alts  just a crazy idea to get it done make it so difficult to produce a marauder or a black ops that only a high sec alliance of 100 people can do it maybe do something similar with modulesdont fear that shipmodule production will take a hit it will until high sec rises to meet the challenge but who cares  let us blob in t1 frigs and cruisers in 00 instead of bses and capitals might even make things a bit more interesting for a while and losing a bs might actually mean something win all around for high sec and 00same goes for missioning dont make it more profitable make it more challenging make so that in order to do a lvl4 in high sec thus no pvp you need 2 bs 2 cruisers and a logistics ship  maybe even a command and definitely an indy to do the salvaginglooting afterward id love to be able to do a mission for laughs with 3 other guys using eve voice right now there is no need for that yes isk input in eve will take a hit for a while but again who cares  people will adapt to this and there is already too much isk around in wallets to keep people buying until things stabilize
eva csm ankhesentapemkah commented that research should also be a lot more dynamic as research is currently too static and predictable she suggested having a more variable outcome as well as unique and special rewards that could be obtained through researching an example was to add tech 2 blue print originals as a very rare outcome of an rd process as well as other new and unique itemsi like the idea but not unless there are heavy skill reqs and the chance to get t2bpo is 1 out of 100otherwise current t2 bpo owners will uproar too much and invention might become useless because of the large amount of t2bposit would be nice to implement a time requirment such as you cant get more then t2 bpos per year via that process combined with the above percent that i posted i think that it would be balanced
the problem lies in the fact the people have combat mains and industry alts because the difference in skills required is very wide for manufacturing in particular it would be nice to need the following manufacturing skills based on their current combat counterpartsspaceship command  industryfrigates and destroyers  small hull constructioncruisers bc  medium hull construction requires small hull ivbs  large hull construction requires medium hull ivcapital ships  capital hull construction requires large hull ivt2 ship  advanced racial hull construction requires industry v ships need this skill plus level v hullother possibilitiesnavigation  propulsion systems constructiongunnerymissile launcher operation  weapons systems constructionelectronicsshield  support systems constructionhull upgradesengineering  internal systems construction
being fatalistic about lag comes from years of sitting on one side of gate or the other dying or being liberated of your ship while you wait for the grid to load ccp has seriously conditioned us into accepting this lag as the status quo and we believe there is nothing that can be done about it hence the apathy displayed by the eve community as a whole to provide pressure on ccp toward improving lag caused by massive fleet engagementswe recently had a titan pilot dd friendlies and allow the enemy to escape partly due to a laggy node this is how influential the issue with the robustness of the eve servers is the strength of the node becomes one of the major deciding factors in the outcome of major fleet battles in eve the skill determination and decisions of our pilots and fleet commanders become secondary and diluted by a faltering nodewe see this happening all the time and just throw up our hands shake our heads and utter thats just the way it is  apathyccp can fix this and they are tentatively showing slow signs that they will in the future at some point apply some effort to improvements to fix server lag however who knows when we just need to pressure them into knowing this is the real and urgent priority to us the pilots of eve not all this other crap they are doing to improve eve when did core playability in mmo games become secondary to cosmetic improvementlaggy massive fleet engagements is a major playability issue to 00 alliance we just dont know it because like pavlovs dog weve been conditioned over many years to ignore it and just live with it
let me just ask you this then  do you really think that theyre unaware of the lag problems remember the devs play this game and theyre disproportionately pvpers the oldtimers among them were suffering lag before the game got out of beta and theyve been suffering it for the 5 years since im sure that they would to a man love to have silkysmooth responsiveness in thousandman fleet ops but they cant neglect game development to do it since thats how they get new subscribers and before you say less lag  more subscribers no it doesnt noobs dont experience lag since they dont play in l4 hubs or fleet blobs and even if they have discovered jita its an occasional thing id love to see ccp rewrite the games code install a brandnew supercomputer and run a fibre optic line from rekjavik to my modem but its not realistic hence fatalism  they want it changed i want it changed and itll change eventually on its own schedule the ten thousandth whine thread on the topic wont change that
i whole heartedly agree but as you hinted on before this is way more than just a server side problem this endresult of their programming methods can be seen in our singlethread clientswhy should your game freeze when you open up the corp history tab on a corp hopperwhy should your game freeze when you accidentally open up your corps sanctionable actionswhy should your game freeze when you open up a hangar with a lot of itemsone of the biggest killers is the fact that even when they modified the client to use directx9 graphics they still maintained a singlethreaded experience
while im not against them putting energy into these fleet issues in theory i kinda feel that way too much energy goes into supporting the massive fleet stuff alreadyit does have marquee value and they can show it off and a few alliances really love them but the bulk of the eve population will never see one of these fights outside the news section and have very little interest in themyet developer resources pour into null sec war mechanics more ships bigger ships alliance toys etc etc to a detriment to other play stylesin other words the stuff you are asking for is already the favored child of the development process not some ignored little aspect unfortunately it is also a really hard problem to solve which is why it always looks like so little progress is being made
the amount of time wasted on vanity projects such as the walking expansion suggests more should have been about this by now
this balancing issue must not be forgotten
dont use it probably never will but from the stats i have seen from many fights with arty ships in the ranks i tend to agree something needs to be done for the poor ducttapers

i agree this is an exploitif you choose to join a corp that is in a war you should be made to stay in that corp till war is over period
yes its much easier than changing an entire mechanic or warfare it used to be implemented so just put it back
support as this is an obvious exploit but honestly the whole war mechanic itself needs to be looked at its completely broken and doesnt at all serve any purpose anymore and is basically only used for griefing wars should be between corps andor alliances have a beginning a goal and an end for example if you wardec a 00 alliance you should have to show your face in their space once in awhile if you want to maintain the war instead of sitting in empire like a coward
i also support thisneeds to be an exploit
all though this subject was covered two days earlier
i too agree that this should be considered an exploit and that it needs to be resolved
this fix is way way ezsimply make so u cant be fully accepted until your dockedthe accepting corp could accept your application but it wont go into effect until you dockproblem solved
whichever gm you talked to must have been daftleaving a corp to avoid wardec and rejoining later is a bannable offense and thats clearly what hes doing
i agree with the thread title i didnt read the text even if they can leave the corp but remain a target until the wardec is over i dont see a problem with that
okay guys hate to shoot some things down but here is realityisk farmers make corps now they infiltrate corpsshops use a character that they get into a corp in xyz alliance so that character can fly around and grab loot from the can farms the ratters use to store faction lootthey dont use the character much and anyone that uses this character tends to be an english speaking personeveryone has farmers andor a farmer loot gatherer in their alliance and they dont know it especially 00 space holding alliancesso forcing restrictions on what agents they can use if they are not in a corp would just force them into a corp we cant wardec anyhowyou can never wardec an isk farmer corp they dont have roles and drop the corp when the war is declared and jump into another corp within minutesbenn tried tested and that is how they dodge wardecsno amount of petitions for exploits do any good gms say they can do it all day long and there is nothing to stop thembasically the joke is on you for going after the farmers your lost isk and in the meantime they lost a grand total of 30 seconds  thats how long it takes for them to dock at the end of their mission and drop corp accept an app in the next corp and keep truckingthe game mechanics are all for farmers at this stage they can evade wardecs they can evade pvp by cloakinglogging they can transfer isk via market transactions safely they suicide alts in the ice fields at uptime to prevent ganks they are an immense drain on resourcesi am sure i have missed somethingall of these ideas about kicking them out into corps is all fine and good but dodging a wardec should not be allowedit would work if you could not leave a corp with an active or declared war they were forced into corpsthen macro hunter groups would actually clean them out easily
solution every 10 cycles of mining the person at the computer must do something that would be easy for a person but near impossible for all but the best macro programs internet sites use those crazy picture codes have the person at the computer input the code or do some sort of calculationanything that makes mining more interactive will work hope to see this in the industry patch
u want to stop isk farmers and isk spammers just dont buy isk its pretty easybut i support this thread anyways d
signed
is that why i have reported 10 farmers so far and they have not been banned not even one of themi get the usual  we will investigate the issue further  response and a month later all the farmers are still up and farming isk farming benefits only ccp hence why they arent really doing anything to fight them in the first place ccp
something to keep in mind for everyone who keeps saying isk farmers are easy to spot i can see them why cant ccpccp has a somewhat different burden then playing when it comes to tracking down cheaters they really can not act based off someone looking like a macroer as opposed to someone with multiple or free accounts sitting and neurotically playing since they have actual money and potentially liability on the line if a player gets it wrong they get a bit of egg on their face and maybe feel bad but probably dont care all that much if ccp gets it wrong their bottom line is effected and they might potentially get into an argument with the credit card company about improper denial of service which will cause a fine from the credit card company and those can really eat into your pocket if you are a moderaly small buisness like ccp
covetors are still used to mine with more often than you may think covetors are often used to mine in low sec and 00 situations where security is lacking or war time conditions exsist less tears are shed over losing a 20m ship vs 100m shipalso for fun fit a 1mn ab or a civilian shield booster in the med slot works nicely too
the training times for the covetor are way too long compared to the next step up it is the only t1 ship besides the iteron 5 that requires 5 in its primary skill
agreed on both points and i would also vote for the astrogeology reduced to level 3 treeloxthats right but it isnt an argument against this whole idea right
no it is not but i dont really see much of a need to lower the requirements the only benifit i see to lowering the requirements is that macrominers could be pushed out into the belts quicker otherwise i see no real need for this change and i honestly believe that i would say that if i was starting over from scratch again
i see nothing wrong with adding more slots to the mid however they will be relatively useless without additional pgcpui see no reason to change the skill requirements
while lowering the requirements would not do much for the hard core focused miners it would do wonders for those who are part time miners right now unless you want to invest some serious time into skilling barges you have the effect of quick into retriever stuck therethe analogy for combat ships would be like having frigates destroyers then nothing till t2 battlecruisers fine for someone who all they are doing is training up for the big nasty combat ships but would kinda screw anyone who was only dipping in and wants a gradual progression
except destroyers dont obsolete frigs cruisers dont obsolete destroyers etcthe covetor certainly obsoletes the retriever
depends on where in the game you are talking in mission running which is often compared to mining for instance destroyers do obsolete frigates cruisers obsolete destroyers battlecruisers obsolete cruisers and battleships obsolete battlecruisers
well the descriptions havent been changed yet and the fact of the matter is that igs is full of roleplay where you really dont want to mess things up with fw ooc posters cas is way more dead then a zombie and caod just isnt the place to throw fw discussions in as will be felt by both fw and alliance players as it is now most stuff is posted in general where it doesnt belong eithernothing and i repeat nothing in forum descriptions sections or threads points to info about fw so the person who wants to read about it has to skim through everything to find anything on the boards is where the forum pvp should be happening where the vendettas shud rise where ppl can read at work about what battles with what results are happening and that will keep ppl in the game fafa fw is concerned all you can see now is the stats page and thats it and even there nuthing is happening besides more and more ppl quitting on fwim not even involved in fw heck im not even actively playing i just visit these boards to see if fw is hot enuf to get me back into the game and tbh what i see in terms of facilitating from ccp isnt very encouraging ur doing something halfway n not finishing it off or doing it properly learn from other rvr games where things are indeed kicking not having flamewars is bad coz it only shows there is rivalry and competition which is what fw desperately needs dont be afraid to put some extra forum mod attention on it u shud be stimulating this if fw is to survive as a viable concept at allgiving fw a forum is not putting it away in a ghetto it means facilitating and stimulating it giving it public face and recognition it is stuffed away in a ghetto as it is now heck there isnt even a ghetto at present as it is now theres just nothing giving it a platform  not hiving it away if you cant see that you just never did any rvr
i stand corrected there isnt just nothing no theres a sticky in the eve general discussionand hold your breath theres actually info stickied in the drums game development section now why couldnt i think of that
okay for the sake of clarification im going to elucidate you all on what the matter at hand isthe issue raised by players and ccp and supported by a silent majority is that carriers are becoming the new battleship its a matter of simple mudflation and the progression of scope creep in eve online the issue is not solo carriers but fleets of carriers yes carriers need support but right now the best support for carriers is unquestionably yet more carriers we want carriers to be on the front lines but we do not want carriers to be the front lines themselvesin order for developers to maintain interest among veteran players they increase the marketability of their product by continuously releasing new features with new expansions as time progresses the levels explicitly or implicitly achievable by older players moves ahead farther and farther yet newer players or in many cases simply players who fly ships that require less skillpoints remain at the same initial starting point this is known as scope creep and it is bad for the game because ccp does not create ships so that they can be discarded after the next expansion they want to see their roles preserved and they want to see time and money spent modeling and coding paying off as an investment overall scope creep leaves many players who do not want to participate in the constant vertical migration out in the cold factional warfare released in the last expansion is an admirable attempt to turn back scope creep and give new players and smaller ship pilots something to do but it does not address the core issues with the most profound instance of scope creep in eve referred to as capital ships online
to substantiate the importance of this topic allow me to show you some samples of developer quotes taken from evetv interviews from the pvp tournament in quarter 1 this year viewable here
carrier change ideasover the past year many suggestions have been raised for how to change carriers some were good some not so good here are a few sample suggestions one from zarch aldain from the establishment one from ernest graefenberg from razor alliance and one from yours trulyzarch aldains idea
admittancemy ideas for how to modify fighter damage to allow a specialized carrier to do significantly more damage than current need some work people want to be able to do more damage with fighters if they occupy all of their highslots with drone damage modules but hardly anyone trains advanced drone interfacing to v let alone level iv and 1500 max dps like now is a little lackluster and something like 2500 dps for a carrier with some lowered ability to hit smaller ships maybe could be more reasonable i dont exactly have a clear idea for how to fix that though however i think my idea for nerfing spider tanks and incentivizing repairing support and not other capitals is very good and something at least similar to it would be integral to the game behaving as the developers envisioned recommended changes at base carriers can deploy 5 fightersdrones of their own 125mbitsec bandwidth but can still delegate up to 10 including original 5 to gang members with carrier v a mothership can use 10 fighters on its own 250mbitsec bandwidth at base but has 20 overall to use at once change dcus so that they give 2 fightersdrones controllable by the carrier instead of 1 and 50mbits bandwidth introduce new highslot module that does something like o disallows fighter delegation to gangmateso enables the carrier to use new bomber fighters that do 5x the damage of fighters but have 1000m signature resolution for their turrets are slower occupy 5000m3 like a normal fighter but you can only launch five at once o disrupts the warp and jump driveo lasts 510 minutes and consumes fuel or not similar to siege modeo problem this makes a carriers max dps similar if not the same as a motherships maybe give motherships an extra damage bonus to bombers so they can do around 3500 dps 4375 for a nyx  consider dividing the drone bay into specific bays one for ordinary drones and one for fighters and bombers make the regular drone bay 10002000m3 just in case the fact that carriers can carry thousands of light medium and heavy combat and logistics drones bothers you its not really a huge issue for me but i dunno it does kind of rub me the wrong way from time to time  reduce capital remote armor repairer capital shield transporter and capital energy transfer array rep amount and cap use by 13 dont freak out until you get to the end please vastly reduce cpu requirements for capital energy transfer arrays capital shield transporters and drone control units  increase the cpu need for officer smartbombs many officer and faction items are harder to fit than other meta levels but smartbombs are an exception change triage module to have something like the following bonuses note that some bonuses are already there currently1 1000 bonus to sensor resolution faster locking 2 immunity to electronic warfare3 cannot move warp or jump probably maybe could negotiate the ability to move on grid4 2x bonus to capital remote repshieldtransporterenergytransfer amount more efficient 5 2x bonus to capital armor repairer and capital shield booster amount6 5x bonus to capital armor repairer and capital shield booster duration more repaired but harder on cap use 7 immunity to capital remote armor repairers capital energy transfer arrays and capital shield transporters but not large medium or small ones8 1000x capacitor need for electronic warfare modules9 cannot use its own fighters but can still delegate them to gangmates probably 10 small boost to capital logistics module range reduce skill prerequisite for tactical logistics reconfiguration to logistics iv instead of logistics v
the idea behind the 5fighter nerf was that it was meant to incentivize carriers repairing the support instead of just other carriers only the support can use the fighters and if the support dies then the fleet has lost their effective total dps to prevent this the carriers have to keep the support alive basically returning them to their original ideal role the problem is not just that carriers and motherships can at least sometimes operate without support but that in many cases the best support for carriers is yet more carriers leading to unwanted alphaclassingcarriers arent used to repair support in battles very commonly now because of lots of things both in and out of player control people cant rep their support too effectively because of things like lag where a subcapital ship will be dead by the time the repairer activates making them want to rep other carriers instead in addition carriers always have much higher resistances than subcapitals making it more efficient in terms of hpsecond to rep other carriers further carriers are more expensive individually than subcapitals so people want to rep those since it hurts more to lose a carrier than just a bsmaking repairers extra worthwhile in triage mode means that carriers have to use triage to gain the real benefits to support but also means that they cant spider tank their carriers anymore because of the immunity to capital logistics modules this puts an upper limit on the number of carriers or motherships in a fleet where at larger fleet sizes 100200 they are still somewhat useful but i imagine people would find it too risky and would not want to bring them out because they would be afraid of getting primaried by an entire fleet and losing their carrier or mothership to this i would point out that a standard archon has 31 times the effective hitpoints of your standard fleet megathron and the archon in triage can repair itself with one capital repairer that repairs as much as four and has the cap use of just two if a battleship fleet primaries that archon and the archons fleet attacks the enemy battleships the battleships may have destroyed a carrier worth maybe 20 billion isk altogether but the archons fleet has destroyed at least as much in tech 2fitted battleships and almost guaranteed substantially more in the same time frameif you want to repair other carriers you can still triage a carrier and have it repair an attack carrier but if you want to repair a carrier in triage you have to use subcapitals such as logistics cruisers a carrier in triage can transfer energy and repair armor or shield on a handful of logistics cruisers and while that may not be able to keep a carrier alive under a fleets firepower it will still prolong the carriers life at the very least whats more with a repairers power split by three maybe more its up for debate a carrier can repair multiple ships with greater efficiency but also adjust which modules to activate to retain cap stability the maximum amount that a carrier could repair remotely has definitely decreased and now there is a weak link in spider tankings chain but overall i think that people could adjust over time and in the end accept the benefits of greater efficiency more ships repairable at once more granular activation of logistics modules better cap stability and more still maybe you could consider adding in a script that gives you basically the same triage module that you have now just for fun
it could be the case that they may have to revisit the ewar immunity of motherships retaining their immunity to conventional warp scramblers but removing the immunity to damps ecm and webs since otherwise there is no weak link in the chain to take advantage of but whether or not it is necessary is up for debate other little things to consider buffingfighter cost  theyre a little on the expensive side if they got nerfed maybe itd be safe enough to make them a bit cheaper skill prerequisites  carriers require months of skills exclusive to capital ships that have absolutely no benefit to subcapitals such as advanced spaceship command and advanced drone interfacing ccp has already tried to alleviate this by introducing the black ops battleship but still please consider removing some skill prerequisites such as jump drive operation v advanced spaceship command v and so on this makes the blow a lot lighter for people who were in the middle of training for capitals but feel disappointed that theyre going to be nerfed and the skill training time is boring and causes harmful stratification between newbies and veterans and thats bad enoughmothership buffs  please consider some of the ideas for the remote ecm burst and the clone vat bay published in this thread
how about we fire zulupark and nozh
i would like to see a lot more thought poured into carriers and this is a good start for now signed and i wait with anticipation
bane is a smart and eloquent man
supportedhopefully this stays on topic it was an excellent read i was gonna ask for a tldr but its actually worthwhile because there are good rationales in there
i endorse this messagenote there are no emotes to suggest that i am joking
tldr versionsimply put are you pro or con zuluparks proposal concerning carriers
stop whining and read the whole thing it is much more in depth than zuluparks and youre being rude
bane i have no idea whether i agree with your ideasand those of others that you bring forward but theyre at least interesting im not wholly opposed to the state of carriers asis but id likely be in favour of a wellconsidered change to how they operate as long as it ultimately made sense carriers being endgame is a problem and while i dont think its as bad as zuluparks dev blog made it out to be its something id like to see addressed capitals are for old rich players who need a big hammer for a specific nail theyre not supposed to be pwnmobiles for the sake of it im not sure any of the specific changes proposed are the right one but i think youre at least barking up the right tree tldr  read the damn post cretin
then why reference zulupark in the subject line if they are more in depthmore thought out than zuluparksi can not be arsed to read anything more than 23 lines long if it contains his name in it im sure you understand why
zuluparks dev blog is the single most prominent example of the discussion bane wants to have regarding the roles of capital ships in the future and he referenced it for that reason and if you cant be arsed to read it then stop being arsed to clutter up the thread whining for a secretary either participate in the thread or stfugtfo
understood and thats fine basically zulu has expressed discontent with capitals online based on that thought and similar discussions bane constructed a solution that seems to lie parallel with the views and concerns of the developers the carrier fixes he proposes attempt to shift it to more of a support role rather than its current role as the quantum unit of fleet engagement
i am always stunned when i hear such sentiments from devs that they didnt expect capital ships to become the next bs ofc they would it only evolution they provided in game everyone one wants bigger badder more pew pew basic human nature and the devs perfectly fed it when they introduced carriers 2ish years agoanyways back to the op i am currently reading it mulling it over might even sleep on it and get back to you all later rome wasnt built in a day you knowps herschel yamamoto change your rag a bit more frequently imopss fahtim meidires at least we kept banes thread in the top 5 while you educated me 
this isnt the first issue that was initially voted down when it was too vague and then reconstructed to specificity and posted in the assembly hall to gain fresh support and force it on the table so it may be thats the goal if it was presented poorly the first time hopefully this suffices
bomber fighterslol so dreads will be usefull only for pos killingalso imo fighter delegation need some nerf because mostly during subcapital ship fights carriers just sitting near poses and delegating fighters
this was all discussed
bumping this jeez
being a carrier pilot myself i have to say they have become the new battleship of eve tbh carriers dont need to be nerfed combat wise tbh they suck at it the only thing they dont suck at combat wise is engaging targets that are smaller than themselves so carriers were meant to support fleets righti tend to use mine in several rolesfirepower fighterscarrying supplies warp bubbles extra ammo scan probes scan ships cap charges scripts extra drones etctransporting ships to the frontlines generally when we know longerterm engagements are going to go downbut i also use it for logistical purposes such as putting up pos towers keeping them running etc i dont want a jump freighter and i dont want a rorquoral as much as they would help with thisso the only combat duty it has is remote repping and assigning fighters so how aboutremove all ability for them to control their own fighters it sounds harsh but makes sense but increase the number of fighters they can control think this was stated above or something similar to itgive fighters the ability to use some kind of stasis webification but not warp inhibition that would waaaayyy overbalance thingsmake them more of a mobile station and less of a bulldozer more corp hangar space and maybe even a public hangar space for alliance or blue membersnow here is my favorite idea give fighters and other drones the ability to engage enemy drones so instead of the carriers fighters bulldozing everything in sight you can maintain a sort of drone superiority and then work on the enemys ships in conjunction with this give fighters better damage against dronesother fighters and then give them 12 ish damage against battleship sized targets for instance or as was stated above create a new class of fighter such as a bomber i personally think this idea is awesome because it could create some epic dogfights in addition to giving carriers a role that makes sensenuff said
see you gotta kinda prove that bit before we go any furtherlist the names of your silent majority  otherwise refrain from making the claimuse the phrase me and my alliance mates
voting for lavista vista to be kicked from the csm councilflaming fellow csm delegates without adding anything constructive to the topic at hand seems like a display of disrespect shortsightedness and plain utter stupidity
bob yet again trying to stunt game balance in favor of ingame vested interests deploy to counter bane inerfedtitans glorious ideas more as this develops
what if with fixing current bombs ccp added either new class of torpedo bombers or new weapons for sbs that did sufficient damage to capital ships 99 grid reduction for citadel launchers to prevent them from being used against pos modules instead of dreds they could get very tiny range so pos guns will always slaughter them
haters get outvoting to stop capital inflation 08
or maybe i dont think the minority should be able to claim they are speaking for the majority when pushing an agnda which suits their vested interestsyou get that right
supported
i enjoy this one here
good idea
this is really a lot of work between nerfing nano ships and caps wouldnt it just be easier to do a general skillpoint reset along with a 15 million sp cap
just to be clear is this the part that would be escalated there are several different ideas brought up in your writeup but it isnt completely clear which ones would be the ones proposed to ccp if this passes
lots of words that i generally agree with
as i said these ideas are just sample solutions to the problem what ccp decides to do is entirely up to them all three will be included in the submission template for them to read and they will likely give their opinions on their viability escalation in this case is as the topic says a discussion of the issue of carrier spam ccp has no obligation to give a flying fart about my idea specifically
supported at least as far as to have ccp readdress the situation the current solution is less than optimal for numerous reasons not the least of which is the lack of a focus for carriersdreads kill structures and nonnanod capitals nanotitans are abominations but anyhoororquals are mobile mining and hauling beastscarriers and by extension motherships and titans dont have very welldefined roles titans at least have a dedicated logisticstactical angle to them with their jumpbridge ability motherships can jump into an area and clonejump in some support though this facility is of limited use aside from raidingcarriers are basically large dominixes that have a large cargohold is it any surprise then that they are becoming the new battleshipgive carriers a role and a defined function
well despite the fact that you already raised this exact issue before and been voted down i still support it in theory although without specific proposals it is impossible to give any support to the thread unless of course you are planning on not presenting the issues without any proposals to ccp in which case i cant support it either as it would be a waste of their time
didnt read the rest of the posts
i think this proposal just needs a clearer mission statement as the initial writeup in the op is vague and then it quickly gets into very detailed specifics and you have to really dig to figure out what exactly the proposal is all about at present simply supporting having a discussion could go in so many ways that it is very hard to lend support to it despite much more concrete sample recommendations appearing later on in the proposala firm statement at the start would really help this out something like the csm should recommend that ccp revisit the idea of changing the carriers role and that that revisiting should involve increasing the level of specialization in any given carrier fit to prevent it from being a jack of all trades on the battlefield and then later get into the specific types of fits youd like to see possible and what their weaknesses and strengths would bebasically something broad enough that people dont reject the concept because of some silly detail but not so vague that people cant tell what theyre signing on to when they support it
then ill be sure to mention this in the meeting this sundaycan i have your thumbs up now
itt goonswarm tries to get capitals nerfed so they have a chance
why is there no thumbs down option because thats what i would pick
ugh ccp has enough problems coming up with sweeping changes on their own it rarely works out as much as it might bore the lead developer small incremental changes are the only way to do things in a game like eve because the only place you can really learn about game balance is on the live server the skewed riskreward on sisi makes it useless as an indicator of how ships will actually be used on tq and ccp has shown a complete inability to predict totally obvious yet potentially abusive game mechanics cruise missles on kestrals titan fleets etc the biggest problem is that this post completely sweeps under the rug what your own alliance did over the past two weeks where noncapital fleets were used convincingly breaking spider tanks isnt rocketscience everyone knows how to do it although it would be nice if damps on bonused ships at least could manage this again the reality isnt that capital ships are necessarily overpowered but that once you reach a carrier fleet of a certian size its impossible to bring to bear a large enough subcap fleet against them this is a lag issue as much as a capships online issue that said you make a strong point about carriers being able to do too much at once while in combat remoterep  fighter dps  smartbombneutetc means they dont have a lot of weaknesses other than ecm and a large enough carrier blob will be able to survive those 1520 jam chances enough to maintain its spidertank nerfing captial remotereps seems like a pretty simple and straightforward solution eg cutting their rep amount and cap use in half that isnt likely to have any major sideeffects youd need to half the volume of the reps as a result and their mineral cost and make every single cap remoterep into two when the change is implemented but thats all stuff thats been done before
caps turned this game from intresting and fun into boring pos wars and lagfests
this is a good enough post so thank you i agree that the biggest problem with carriers is the difficulty with breaking spider tanks and how their strength increases in a supralinear fashion as carrier numbers increase ernests idea for carriers might be the most like what youre looking for
no i think youll find that poss did that
we have an absolute load of carriers these days
id support that statement more or less uneditedcalling them jack of all trades sums up the issue nicely the issues with carriers is not that they are strictly speaking overpowered they die fairly frequently in combat even to subcapitals but that they have the ability to carry out almost any role one can think of reasonably well with a single generic omnifitting it would be more in keeping with eve if carrier pilots were forced to commit to a particular role like the pilots of every other shiptype are if not at the point of purchase then at least at the fitting screen
i will never support a change that takes fighters out of my own control theyre my fighters not my gangs i trained for them i bought them i want to control them and i think it highly unfair that in order to use my ship im required to have other people around to use it for me thats ridiculous i should always have the option to use my ship as i see fit and not require other people to use it the risk should be higher without support players around me but that would be my choice to use my ship in a risky mannerimagine me telling you that in order to use a battleship you had to be in the gang of a person with wing command 3 in order to use your guns that you can only use 3 of your 6 guns if you arent in a gang w a wing commander 3 leader yeah it makes about as much sense as me not being able to order my own fighters around the issue is spider repping the issue is not fighter control nerf the spider repping the issue with capitals being all powerful will begin to fade its a very simple fix you can only use capital remote reppers if in triage mode this makes carriers a sitting ducki support making dcus more viable a dmg increase sounds nicecapitals should use capitalmodulesonly in high slots give us a capital smartbombneut make sure the fitting requirements are increased restrict non capital mods in highs and youll see less problems mothership tanks need to be improved theyre too easy to take down solo the right gang can do it quickly and without a ton of players involved i expect a ship that i paid 25 billion incl fittings and trained 2 freaking years for will last longer than 3 minutes on the battlefield
thats just it thoughthis isnt a battleship and one of the points of this thread is to keep them from being lessmobile harderhitting versions of battleships maybe nerfing the spidertank will be sufficient maybe more of a stick is needed to wedge carriers into a specific roleim in the same boative actually trained several accounts to use carriers and it is entirely possible that when the carrier is repurposed or betterdefined ill be screwed out of the utility i had in mind however a generic doeverything ship is not good for eveone thing im hoping for is a reduction in the capital remote rep modules in terms of fitting and abilityand a reduction to logistics 4 for the triage module i think the original vision of the carrier was for a subcapital support vesselforce multiplier and if that happens to be the defining vision then i hope it gets to be a bit easier to train into that role having to train dozens of skills to 5 as prerequisites to even sit into the carrier and fit the mods let alone use them well is very harsh logistics 5 is basically forcing people to train battleship 5 all over again
my example was just used for the principal of the matter i 100 agree that carriers shouldnt be the all around gods of the battlefield but carriers are just that  carriers of fighters the fighter should define the carrier not the mods the carrier pilot decides to equip if carriers want to do better at repping members of their gang withdraw their fighters and put out repping drones so again reduce the effectiveness of the remote reppers remove the ability to equip noncapital modules in high slots add more of a variety of capital modules with appropriate fitting costs though and you will see a big difference in the ability of capitals to demolish everything on the battlefield and never die yeah making logistics 4 the prereq for triage wont hurt either there is no need to require delegation of fighters or put other cavioughts sp in order for a pilot to even use his ship though in order to obtain a balance of capitals in the game
i think that this is worth pushing forward
even assuming you limit yourself to these proposals thats just it they are proposals in the plural youre still attempting to forward a large number of proposals in one csm vote you need to break it down into individual proposalscongratulations a really big post this is your proposal to the csm for escalation all these changes and ideas from yourself and others whom you give urls for this is nothing more than a goonswarm wish list designed to give them a bigger easier win buttonas you claim to be a recent graduate in business i would have expected a much better presentation than this confusing bulk array of ideas quotes opinion from a player you dont even name darius personal opinion expressed as the silent majority and nerf ideas for carriers one of these ideas at base carriers can deploy 5 fightersdrones of their own 125mbitsec bandwidth but can still delegate up to 10 including original 5 to gang members with carrier v a mothership can use 10 fighters on its own 250mbitsec bandwidth at base but has 20 overall to use at once is the same one ccp zulupark was unmercifully flamed for when he made it forcing carrier pilots to have what amounts to a copilots in order to deploy their own fighterswhat this all boils down to is reduce effectiveness of carriers decrease skill training necessary to pilot carriers force carriers into a support role as opposed to a direct combat role increase the effectiveness of smaller ships against carriers decrease effectiveness of carriers against smaller ships increase the dependence of carriers upon smaller ships even to the point of making the carrier pilot dependent upon smaller ships to deploy the carriers own drones minimization of the effectiveness of skills older players have and maximization of the effectiveness of skills newer players haveand what that boils down to is candyland for a large alliance composed of relatively new players who are too impatient to dedicate the resources to train for and purchase capitals and who prefer to blob with less expensive and easier to fly ships instant gratification has always been the hallmark of goonswarmolder players with more skills and resources that have been developed over years are what is under attack here without carriers and other capital ships these players will be easily overwhelmed by an alliance such as goonswarm representswindjammerps playing the race card is repulsive enough without being vulgar about it besides photographic evidence seems to indicate youre a curly haired white kid needless to say i and others will not be puckering up regardless of the skin color
the idea of carriers having to specialise is an interesting one and one i think would benifit the game as a wholemaybe having to sacrifice the cha andor the sma to achieve maximum dps or repping potential would be usefull as well and incentivising filling highslots with dps or repping modules ie make 45 dcus or remote reps usable and useful would make it harder to be a jack of all trades
how have i not signed this
hi i came accross this issue recently when i had been contracted to do a copy job on small nosferatu 1 bpo specifically the order was for 20 max run bpcs imagine my suprise when i found out that this would take a grand total of 625 days to do he job which given other small module high slot item times seems unreal to be honestso to give a run down of the research copy times per single copy on the vampire family assuming science five skill please see belowsmall nosferatu 1  15 minsmedium nosferatu 1  30 minsheavy nosferatu 1  60 minsto give a comparison lets compare this with the nosferatus cousin the energy neutralizer familysmall energy neutralizer 1  1 minsmedium energy neutralizer 1  1 minsheavy energy neutralizer 1  1 minsi have bugreported this issue as i had believed it was a bug and i know that previously the copy times on the nosferatus were a lot lower than what they are now and the responce i have received was as followsso what i am asking is that the csm take up this issue and ask ccp to bring the energy vampire bpos copy times into line with that of the energy neutralizer bpos after all when you consider that they are both part of the same energy subsystems family it seems rather strange that they have such vastly different copy times
interestingly enough the small nos bpo used to have the following copy stats but i am unsure whenwhy this was alteredhopefully csm will take up this issue and get it resolved and bring the research times back to how they used to be and inline with the other mods in the energy subsystems family
not an issue that effects me but with the current wishes of ccp being towards balance i think it is important to balance everything
obviously agree with my own topic
i agree for balance sake this should be addressed
the response to the bug report seemed to say that small nos and small neut have the same copy time but the data you provided indicates that they do not is the gm who responded to you in error is your data in error or am i just reading this wrong
its not a gm response discussing gm responses is not eve allowed the response was from a bughunter and they usually consult with the people in the know about that sort of a thingif you ask me this does not really warant a csm issue its very small and not really breaks anything or causes massive issues for anyone
in essence i would agree but to me it looks like ccp are saying as intended when what has probably happened is they have fecked up the db entries for the nosferatus given the apparent disparity between them and neutralizors i would not actually have taken this path were it not for the fact that i have petitioned and bug reported and resubmitted bug report as i was not happy with initial one line responce and basically been left no option forward on it than what the bughunter themselves suggested ie use the csm function
lol good point 1 for reading i am actually going to reopen the bug report because i didnt read properly what the bh said at first re small energy neut 1 will respond back here once i hear more edit blimey bug hunters reply quicklyso yeah guess the previous bher mistyped
this i dont want to disable effects outright and not see important stuff that could actually kill me like dictor bubbles and doomsdays but right now one of the simplest visual issues with eve is looking at a bs fleet that appears to be in a pond kids are throwing stones into
pls
dualboxing one character who flies a falcon and a buzzard and another who flies a thanatos is a total nightmare because of this restriction while it should be just a two click process to switch from one hull to another instead it takes five minutes of shuffling scan probes and lo around just so i can keep my cargohold full of the things i need to go about my businessutterly unacceptable
agreed
carrier pilot posting to say that this is needs to be looked into
please yes
yeah you guys basically need to either start learning how unfun your game is to play or start listening to the players who actually play your game fix this and maybe increase playability for once instead of adding broken new features that nobody asked for or wanted
as you have some need to not allow the cha of a carrier to allow it to be used for logistics as some form of meet in the middle not allowing industrials in the cha of carriers could be an option
please for the love of eve devs take notice and act on it
agreed
seriously this change needs to happen
while i dont fly capitals  carriers this sounds like a good argumentsupported

very much agreesigned

great idea
nice

do it fffffff

i think there needs to be more than just ammo allowed but not everything in specific i am talking about cyno fuel etc
nice troll
do it

yase
this was always a horribly conceived nerf
this
how can i effectively run a group of frigates from a carrier fully fitted and ready to go and extra parts to spare with this nerfi thought the idea of carriers and motherships were to be mobile stations thus why they have clone vat bays etc whats the point of those if people cant effectively use the ship for the very purpose theyre designed forthings need to be changed back to how they were or have less restrictions
please do this there are far better options available for largescale hauling and it makes too many little things annoying
poorly implemented then unnecessary now probably the most hamfisted change ive seen ccp make
i agree if only to allow things like base minerals and trade goods to be held in ship cargo while docked
how about allowing everything but haulers to have stuff in their cargo hold or as someone else stated only allow 1km3 in a cargo hold
signedrostran targo future carrier pilot
make life easier sure why not
please do this  the restriction no longer serves a purpose
signed
makes sense to me ill bring this to the next csm meeting for considerationiz
having just got into carrier use i can vouch for the frustration of trying to swap ships only to realise you have one non0ammo item in your cargohold or trying to scoop some ships left in a pos etc etc
signed
still is a big deal especially for me i abhor having my chatbox moving around when i open the market
i will sign any ui fixing post
ui needs a good long hard look at but some specifics needs to be presented
my main issue is the silly bugs that seemed to crop up recentlytho a complete revamp would not be unwelcome
signed
you have to actually click support to sign thiswe need a multithreaded ui so we dont hang when opening a window and eventually multiprocessor support
fix ui
i agree that titans need to be changed but i also think that doomsdays can be salvaged even if doomsday damage remains the same limiting their range 30km instead of 250 maybe and adding a drawback that would make them be more of a last ditch resort cant cloak cant warp 50 rep amount and cant jump for a period of time or something wouldnt be badi would actually like to see that titans would be used as more of a front line station as well but have their turrets be useful as well instead of their highslots being only neuts smartbombs and cloaks besides jump bridges and doomsdays with some using clone vat bays
not signed if you remove the doomsday outright no one will ever deploy a titan in a vulnerable position  and no one will have the chance to kill them instead give them offensive abilities that work alongside a support fleet rather than making it a fleet in itself
this will create a new and greater dynamic in deep space logistics
i like it its simple easy to implement etc
agreed people shouldnt need to ask which ts channel were on every 2mins
now we can tell people to read the motd every 2min

i support this
agreedbloody pain
i would like to encourage the csm to think about thismultiple windows for the market tab like you could actually view market details and my orders at the same time or compare prices of the same item with different meta lvl or even different types like ion and neutron blasters would make it much more comfortable imho
yes my veto is in
pro tip use your wallet window to look at your orders and the market window to look at market details at the same timenow on to your idea i would love to be able to have a few different details open at the same time sadly even if we got support for this idea and csm passed it through i bet the database devs would cry that it would make to many calls on the database slowing down nodes maybe crashing them etc etc etcstill a thumbs up from me
1
tim i dont think veto means what you think it meansanyway this is an excellent idea and would be a huge timesaver definitely supported
hehe yeah i noticed that too but i figured id give him a break since he got all the right letters for the word vote
sounds reasonable  would save me a whole lot of switching back and forth to compare various things
1 remove eccm modules and make eccm a sensor booster script this makes good sense and addresses the reasonable complaint that eccm is the only ew counter that doesnt do anything else2 change the signal distort amp to affect all forms of ew damps tds tps if 1620 strength per mod is too much and it might be considering the nonecm ships have more low slots and ccp seem to want lower ew strength for nonecm ew then 1012 or 1215 would still be pretty useful imo caldari ships should still have the most powerful overall ew but other races should be allowed the option to use fitting options to increase their power losing low slots is a pretty decent tradeoff for ships which are actually supposed to fight3 add an ew falloff range rig sensor damps and tds rely heavily on their falloff rangein short im not in favour of an ecm nerf but i do believe that other forms of ew need a little help to be more useful
1 is interesting and as long as they figured out how to compensate all involved i could go for it 2 makes good sense and 3 does as well
thank you theres probably more that could be done but im trying to keep my proposals deliberately simple and modestif a t2 sensor booster can add 60 sensor strength that will give a very significant boost to the chance of resisting a jam to larger ships 2x t2 would with stack penalties give about 210 this isnt exactly an ecm nerf but i think it would allow a much larger number of people the chance to resist ecm attacks without fitting an otherwise inutile modwith respect to boosting the other ew types the sda change is the simplest way to implement it and its automatically balanced as well the specialised ew ships will be able choose to reach their prenerf abilities  at the cost of gimping their nonew ability the choice will be there i prefer to add options rather than always nerfingthe ew falloff rig is simply filling an obvious gap in the rig lineup i know damps used to be overpowered but not including this rig is simply blatant discrimination against gallante ew which everyone now agrees is much less useful that it ought to bethe changes i propose would overall result in a little less overall power for ecm and a decent increment for nonecm caldari should be about more than ew and the other races should be able to at least play the ew game
what we need is a eccm skill there are skills modules rigs faction officer stuff that improve ecm jamming however there are very few things to improve eccm we need to boost eccm we dont need a nerf on ecm
i thought about that  tds and damps are both countered by skills but i couldnt come up with a solution i liked whats your suggestion
absolutely
seems reasonablefull support and a highfive
noone uses maller its a crap ship most people doesnt even know about my maller thread on the ships and modules section just instantly decayed with only 1 other person replying it this clearly shows that noone flies the maller noone knows how to fit a maller to make it competetive and that noone gives a  about iti propose that we increase mallers armor hp by 200 mass by at least 2000 remove its current boniis and give it a large mwd bonus insteadwith the proposed changes the maller will be usefull as a bumper to knock ships larger than itself around the huge inertia will allow it to keep its speed even if the mwd dies from scrambler the nanofix patch and also allow it to even give carriers a pushthis will also solve the crappy whackamole problem with stationhugging battleships and captials the maller will simply push them awaye forgot about that its turret slots should be reduced to 2 so that people doesnt abuse the extra armor and makes uberbuffermallers instead
naturally i supports my own topic
okay the maller sucks i agree but your idea is seriously appallingly bad like nightmarishill give you a thumbs up but jesus im glad youre not the one calling the shots at ccp
after playing on sisi and experiencing the new bss that maneuver and fly like supercaps seeing intys nerfed in speed 40 and looking at skills you trained and stuff you bought wasted and reduced to nothing do you vote for no confidence in the management of the dev team which admitted in the dev blog that they came up with the concept of this massive kick to the balls nerf in a mere 5 hours whilst players have proposed far superior solutions over the last yearimho whomever came up with this stupid plan should not be allowed to plan anything more complex than possibly lunch that we dont have to eat ever again this proposal makes as much sense as swatting a fly with a nuclear bomb and will produce the same collateral damage 117kms with nav 5 on a freaking raven stupid
i of course support my own proposal
if they only came up with this nerf in 5 hours then that in itself is questionablejust based on the number of pages in the yes to the nerfno to the nerf motions in this forum i would say that this is a very big deali dont support the nerf because the nerf represents the whining and crying of those that never actually tried to combat nanogangsits actually quite easy
edit thought twice ill avoid bashing the op
i hope they made the nerf in 5 hours  honestly it is a good tactic and hear me out herefirst off we all know that the speed nerf is subject to change the fact that this warning is in big yellow letters tells u that not everything will be included the best way to test a speed nerf is to apply everything at once then look at the pros and cons of each individual changei doubt half of the nerf will make it through but i applaud the devs if they all got drunk and in 5 hours thought of all the things that could balance speed well see in a week or two a completely revamped nerf that will be tested again before the final changes
honestly after hearing player feedback in general im quite convinced that eve is better off if they dont listen to player feedback in general
four devs who have been thinking about speed for a year sitting down and spending five hours hashing out ideas facetoface is a whole hell of a lot more than five hours of forum ing frankly that sounds like a whole lot of time to me  id be unimpressed by 20 people for 5 hours but 4 guys can actually get stuff done i dont really like a lot of the changes but im not going to vote no confidence because of that alone
personally you would have gotten a check from me is you had called for a vote of no confidence in the balance teamafter all i wouldnt be paying to play if i thought all of the devs were doing a terrible job some of them are really cool guys cough greyscale coughthe one thing i will second however is that it does seem at times that all some members of the balance team cough zulupark cough nozh cough do 247 is sit around drink beer smoke ganja and dream up as many ways as possible to screw over eve and its playerbasemy two iskcheersps the final insult 117 ms raven 125 ms max skill fenrir yep thats right the freighter is faster than the battleship something a little wrong with this picture you think balance team maybe huh just a little
supportin da op my positions are quite clear in the threads ive started and discussed in its a terrible idea
the single biggest problem with nano ships wasnt their combat abilities it was how fast they could move across the map and evade things they shouldnt be able to
like they were too fast
in a manner of speaking ccp has been trying to help keep alliances into a more local focus rather than spanning multiple regions this is why they dropped sov 5 from my proposal when they used it it is also why they made more entrances into 00nerfing nanos to ccp is primarily about traffic control and population management what they are doing is trying not to overdo itbut most players are too selfish to notice anything other than their ships not doing 10kms anymore
nozh mode thank you for pointing this out sylthi we of the dev balance team realize we have made a mistake here and are fully willing to admit thatfreighter sublight and warp speeds will be halved with the next patchnozh mode
adapt or die you bunch of girlie girls
the balance team has no idea what they are doing what they are screwing with and are the epitome of how not to interact with people regarding game play changespretty much a lot of idiots
lol wut the i vote you kill yourself
lol whatyes youre going to vote zomg no confidense in the entire development team oh man burnso what does that actually mean nothing squat it means angry people on the forum have made posts that range from valid to completely asinine regarding a design changeif you want to vote no confidence in the development team do it with your wallet anything else especially something as dumb as this would be pointless
look please quit it with silly no confidence in xyz threads they have no meaning its just spam get on the test server test the changes help the devs and testers see the impact of these changes on the game and make your point in a useful waycan we have this thread locked please
buy a stock majority or stfu
vote with you feet and wallet not with some stupid thread no one gives a  about if you feel that stronglysupporting anyway just in case
crosspost from
i think you are right most people suggesting changes only look at the specific ship and its counterparts and expect the ship to have the same qualities instead all ships are created differently and have their own little quirks that make them interesting to play withlooking at the bigger picture is much more interesting and probably a lot more people care and have ideas about that i think what you csm folks should try and get some discussions going on the different aspects of things that you feel could do with improvement after all you are elected to lead the discussion and interpret the wishes of the community
lavista is the goal to come up with a recommendation on how to handle ship balance issues what response are you looking for from the other csm membersdoes the csm need some formal action from ccp to redirect ship balance concerns through other channels or can that goal be accomplished more informally and immediatelyassuming ship balance issues were somehow collected into one master list and ratified by the csm or the playerbase would that be an appropriate formatitem to present to ccpwould the csm be endorsing specific actions such as powergrid increases and module changesif the csm simply refused to take up ship balance issues the attentions of the community may just be redirected to the bigger picture things in a way it is up to the csm to provide leadership and filtering on this and not just wait for the playerbase to tell them what to do i think its far too slippery a slope to continue entertaining these highly specific issues that ccp is unlikely to respond positively to
yes i think for continuity reasons its important we figure out a good way for handling balancing issues unlike bigger issues balancing issues tends to be fairly simplethus a streamlining for the process as described would be a possible solution but for now lets have a good discussion changing the way a body like the csm shouldnt be taken lightly since we need to represent the community they need to understand how the council works too and they have a say tooim sure if we talk to ccp with a proposal for how we should submit these it will be fineelse we can restructure our internal processes but that is not too good due to continuity yes that would be pretty good in my eyes i suggested a similar way in the opits hard to say the csm would of course have to agree that these suggestions are to be presented to ccp but im not sure about how a vote would work on that etcwe would have to discuss this for implementation at a later timeyes you are completely right i would hate to see that the community think we are filtering balancing issues just because we can it seems elitist the problem is that there is no channel for raising balancing issues from the community to ccp i would like if there was a way but i dont think csm is the best place but sadly its the only place that would force us to do it
ship balancing issues as lavista rightly points out is just one of the smaller issues that takes up a lot of time for the csmship balancing imo can never be 100 perfect for all of the eve players due to the fact that a player can have characters in any of 4 races with secondary racial characteristics this means that ccp gives each race exactly the same set of ships ignoring racial differences which would result in some races getting better bonuses in some areas and others in different areas or it tries as it has to take account of the strengths of a race and cater ships towards thosethis means that straight off before skills are taken into affect there is a spectrum of different ships that will each suit different types of players within each class of ship for each race there is further possible variation depending on the skills of the character and modulefittinguse ability rigs etc etcessentially there are many possible types of final ship types depending on a character type and skills etc it then follows that there will be major differences between the ship of a certain race class and that of a different race of the same classthis is all kept continuous ingame via the storyline with different corps producing the types of ships for each race each ship with its strengths and weaknessesthe problem comes when a player designs a ship they think will do well against other ships only to find that another ship has an advantage in an area they have overlookedessentially the shipbalancing calls place the csm and ccp in a nowin situation players want an ubership that can hold its own and defeat other ships we dont like it when we overlook something and are made to pay the price on the battlefieldanyone watching tourney battles will quickly come to the conclusion that certain ship types are useful in certain situations there is no one answerits essentially like cars in real life each is made to do or fulfil different functions they all look different and have different attributes they even are made by different designers and manufacturersthe betterness of one type over another depends upon how they are employed and who is using them and the situation they are used withini personally dont think the csm should be used as a portal for ships to be tweaked to make them better or like another ship there is a place for it its called the features and ideas discussion forumedit i dont think balancing is needed unless there is some major area that is not working as intended eg speed variety as they say is the spice of lifearithron
ive been on record from the very beginning see link below sig pic that i am not inclined to support ship nerflove always love really  few people ask for ships to be nerfed unless there is an extremely good case for it this is the game we have and generally we choose to fly the ships we fly if we dont like one particular ship we always have the options subject to skilling for it to fly a different make race and modelsfaiac the csm should be more concerned with considering how the universe works than how a specific module or ship is engineered iz
i like what ccp did with the sansha faction ships personally and would like to see the same done to angel ships and blood ships in some regard as well
nah
tarminics idea looks exactly like mine only he added limitations to what systems and modules you can target based on what defenses are still in placeas for how to make it worktry using a survey scanner sometime it opens a new menu window just like your overview with little dropdowns for the various ore types then you leaf through the options based on range most often and start miningthis systems scanner could do the same thing you lock onto a ship and activate the scanner it opens an extra menu which wouldnt be too big and obscuring since all itd show is weapons shields armor engines warp cap etc basically all the vital parts of the ship i dont see this system allowing you to very precisely target their large armor repairer ii but it could cause damage to armor repairs which would carry over and if you happen to be caldari then targeting their armor repairs wouldnt do much good now would itlittle menu box with a couple of options score enough hits and they cant fire back or they cant mend damage or they cant run away
now its good dtargeting of subsystems could be implemented in the targeting menu as a dropdown option that falls off the side of the rightclick menu also as a dropdown from the target button in the selected item windowsubsystems should have a specified very low percentage of the signature radius of the targeted ship this makes it automatically very hard to hit with anything more than very belowtier weaponrysubsystems should be reparable by remotereppers allowing triage to put a wounded cap back into action etc sig radius just makes them harder to lock here giving logistics and triage more lease in lifesubsystems should have a small slice not adding up to 100 of shieldarmorstructure of the targeted ship simulating the overwhelming of all local defenses in a very specific location all the way through the structuresubsystem damage should be counted against the total hp of the ship using the regular damage calculations on a simulated slice of the ships hp ie if it takes 16000 shield 12000 armor and 14000 structure to blow up the subsystem that amount of damage should be applied to the ships shield armor and structureaoe weapons do not affect subsystems at all 6000m radius is not pinpoint enough psubsystems should automatically repair their structure over time but require remote or local repping to recover their armorshieldsubsystems should receive repair from ships own tanking mods but with a weighted percent of total damage repair applied to the subsystemi dont know how all this became so clear to me so fast but i can already hear the 11000 carrier pilots cringing and the bomber pilots going nuts synopsis of the implementationsmall ship weapons will hit your subsytems on capital bs as well ships if they can blow up the protection and do structure damage to the system before you can get a repcycle in you will start eating subsystem structural damage these systems will regen over time becoming active again upon reaching full structure they will become deactivated again once damaged to 0 structure again a carrier or any logistics can give your subsystems extra protection get rid of small ships to prevent losing access to systemsavailable systems should bepropulsion jump drive speed and agility cut way backhigh slotsengineering large capacitor dropno rechargesensors easier to jam slower locks lose rangeyes jump drive you have smartbombs fighters drones ddds and should have support a wing of bombers working effectively can pin a capsupercap big tradeoff of pilots required pilots who could be flying tackling ships which are more general purpose and probably regarded as superior in pvp anyway fair trade in tactics you can still warp but align very slowlyi think hitting tanking mods makes absolutely no sense because itd be more like hitting the module that is the locus of all defenses of the ship there would be so much shieldarmor rep coming from that location that the small weapons that could hit it would be working against the total hp of the ship not just a slicebasically your worst nightmare as a cap pilot becomes getting alphastrikes from bombers that hit in between repcycles anything else probably wont have the alphatrackingexplosion radius to hit the weak point hard enough fast enough i stress that the sig radius should be very small and the hp should be to where a bomber wing can pin a cap fleet bombers are a specialized ship with not so much usage so dont complain that its too much for a small ship because its a specialized ship that will still require good coordinationpos warfare trick of the month is to blow up the engineering on a dread and take it down before its out of siege
i would support this for targeting capital ship systems thus making smaller vessels a danger to them like that a wing that takes out the executor bridge in return of the jedion smaller vessels i dont think it would be as good
anyone here played tie fighter loved that game
i still think the tactical sensor module would be easier to implement1 to prevent subsystem damage from a 150km sniper the sensor has a much closer range you have to be pretty up close and personal in order to hit specific locations rather than just the ship in general2 the sensor could open a separate menu to display the weak points and the damage meters for each personally i get irritated with all the rightclick flyout menus if you wiggle your mouse just slightly then they disappear or choose something completely different whereas a separate menu would be easier to navigate in the heat of combat3 i dont think that subsystems should each have shieldsarmorhull thats what the ship has in place so either taking the suggestion earlier and saying you cant lock certain systems until the ships defenses are already down or just making subsystem damage resemble heat each area will have a certain amount of damage it can take before it goes down4 i dont think they should repair on their own nor should remote reppers work but i do think we already have the tool for making repairs on our own nanite paste
ah i was thinking about it recently as well when i found the drawing board section of patch notesi was thinking on how to implement this and i think i came up with a good idea first you would need skills to use it something liketargeting level ivsurgical strike level ivsubsystem targeting level inow what you could do would be like this instead of aiming specifically for specific modules ie a vagabonds mwd for example you could aim for high slots mid slots and low slots and it would be like overloading modules i cant overload modules yet so correct me if im wrong but you konw when you overload modules they get damaged and un useable for a certain amount of time well what if you could do something similar in this caselike this screen shot see that half circle under structure and the 2 lines that seperate it into 3 sections you could be able to target high slots mid slots and low slots and if the first bar was gone that rack could be deactivated for i would say 3 minutes no module damage you shoot him some more and if the second section was shot down to 0 now the modules are damaged and then deactivated for 5 more minutes the times could stack on top of each other ie you shoot him straight to 23 down so his modules would be deactivated for 8 minutes when and if you shoot it down all the way the modules are extremely damaged like 3940 down and the modules are deactivated for 10 minutes regardless if you repair them or dock at a stationbut these modules wouldnt be exactly easy to hit either it would have to be along the lines of trying to hit a small drone going like 500meters per second or something and you cant even web them the modules so even if you webbed the ship down to 5 msec the modules would still have to be hard to hit of course it would also have to be easier for smaller ships to hit them since they are smaller and use smaller guns themselvesthis would help alot imho so now pirates could shoot or try to shoot modules instead of damaging a shipfor other things normal ship propulsion idk i dont think it should be a death sentence because if you think about it soemone shoots your propulsion out you are a sitting duck and dont know what if the pirates are going to just keep you all there and maybe pop you one by one lmao that would funny though line them up you konw you are next the other ship is itno armor structure boom then you hear the locking sound on your ship lmao anyway if it was to implemented i think i have a good idea on how that would work as well maybe you could shoot propulsion out and it just damages it quite a bit like they shoot out your sublight it would also have its own little bar of health but instead of it being deactivated its performance should be cut down ie first section is shot out ship can only go 66 its normal speed second section shot out ship can only go 33 its normal speed 33 shot out ship can now only go 1 its normal speed and this would work out still on modules that are based off that ships attribute you have a mwd that allows your ship to go 15kmsec for example they shoot out your propulsion and your ship can only go 1 of 15kmsec now your ship can still go 450msec even with its propulsion shot out due to its mwdsame thing should go for warp engines your warp speed could be messed up yoru ship warps at 3au second now it can only warp like 05au a second for example or maybe it could suck way more capacitor to warp out or maybe a combination of bothbottom line though no amount of module popping should prevent you from escaping completely no matter if your propulsion mwd and warp engines are shot out you could still warp away its just more difficultsame thing with weapons and protection you should still be able to use them it should
sorry about double post but maybe also if you dont target the equipment on the ship just targeting the ship itself there could be a random chance something like a strikes perfectly wrecking for    shot that it does damage a module along with it and if it does it shoots it straight down to its first level of damage and that module is un useable however if you are aiming for a certain rack high slot mid slot or low slots when you miss it doesnt damage the ship eitherjust an afterthought
i agree with the idea presented by soldier of fortune here but would make it substantially harder to train for than he presented something along the lines oftargeting vsurgical strike iv or vtrajectory analysis iv or v
ah thank you i knew there were other targeting skills just wasnt sure which onesand thank you for agreeing with me but im not sure about lvl 5 skills those take a while to train for i would say those skills at lvl 4 would be sufficientagain thanks for agreeing with meif this was implemented it would add another complete tactical tool to the game and would give smaller ships a better role in this world when each side starts taking up mass battleship fleets like the caldari a few days ago they built a fleet up of about 20 battleships
sorry but i cant say i like this idea
i could see some extra training to accomplish this but i dont think it requires absolute mastery of targeting skills to achieve unless all level vs means you can shoot the capacitor battery cables off a shuttle in midwarp from 200km awayi think part of the idea is to achieve some of the cinematic action we see in sci fi shows targeting certain systems to incapacitate the ship without destroying it completelyi just dont think the tactical officers on star trek or bsg have all trained so thoroughly into targeting just to make a few extra shots i think they have extra sensitive sensor arrays that allow for it kinda like the tactical sensor i suggested already
as much as it seems like a good idea i loved homeworld 2 and using bombers to that effect was fun there are a couple flaws the main one lag generated by only a couple hundred ships shooting one pos lags a system as is with nothing else to speak of going on in system is a problem as it is having the servers have to calculate even more divvied damage would kill performance and nodesit would be awesome if it could work in this game but i fear that current mechanics and software wouldnt be able to support it
i think it would be an interesting change to the game mechanics if supercapitals and possibly capitals couldnt be tackled in the same way as current ships instead warp disruptors and webs would increase the time they needed to align for warp or to spool up jump drives during this time attackers could target specific subsystems such as propulsion navigation targeting weapons and engineering selfrepairthe idea of a freespacehomeworldstyle system for capital ships appeals to me because it would be interesting to see capital ships as vessels that are tough to destroy outright but possible to incapacitate there is even room for currently underused ship classes such as assault frigates and destroyers to be efficient at damaging capital subsystems
while were all referencing other games so there was this game called empire at war and the absolute greatest damned tricks to pull were either sending in a load of bombers after station shield generators or using hero unit red wing with the lucky shot capability that instantly took out a subsystemon to more serious thingsto address the issue of what to do with the 100k of damage that hits skizzlefists titan while people are aiming for the subsystem do the damage calcs twice once for the subsystem once for the titan subtract the damage that managed to land on the subsystem from the larger number this way a big fleet alpha from bss wont be doing 2k to the subsystem instead of the 100k against the titan like i proposed earlier hits to the subsystem hp should affect the total hp so the total hit to the titan would end up being 100k still with the difference being that a sniper bs fleet would have managed to slide a great deal of it through the keyhole surgically dismantling a capital shipjust make the sensor res small enough and you wont have too many issues with snipers taking out subsystems i wouldnt mind if they did but more in a skizzlefists jump drive is primary alphafleet titannogohome manner in other words the ability to put damage onto subsystems accurately is for small ships but can also be done by smaller ships thus preserving balance in huge carrier fleet vs bs fleet battles hell even cruisers would have anticap value at that point bombers maybe even more so 250 dps like a scalpel is a pretty focused designskizzlefists smartbombs got the hic but not before skizzlefists jump drive was incapd skizzlefist loses supercapid like to see some more entropy from the bottom up we dont need another supercap or cap killer just to increase the options for small ships
damn you skizzlefistthats what i was kinda thinking would be a good focusreason for subsystem targeting to allow the nonbscapital ships a reason to join the fleet when the final killmail against that titan reads assault frigate then i think people will see what we mean
i agree with you 100 but i just dont think that the current game engine can handle such a load if it could be implemented that would be amazing
this is the excuse for every other popular idea that has risen on assembly hall  features and ideas not being implementedmaybe ccp should quit wasting so much time and money making patches that suck for weeks after deployment and fix their game up right and proper firstdatabase errors graphics engine malfunctions get it right for once otherwise this is a 5 year long beta test
as the jammers are the only ew mod that is chance based and racial i think it would be good to remove the racials and add racial scripts to be used on the multies the strength on the multies stays like it is and the script gives it the strength of the racials this way the fitting problems of choice which racials to fit is solved and can be adjusted on the spot like the scripts on the sensor boosters and the scripts on the dampers
err how about no racial jammers are a tradeoff more power in return for maybe getting your selection wrong to make them scriptable would be basically the same as upping the power on multispecs to be the same as racials as an ewar pilot i dont think thats necessary
ok then make the multies as strong as the racials now as jamming in the only form of ew that is chance and racial based make the others forms of ew racial or chance based also or take the racials away
i fly ecm and i hate bringing the wrong jammers however this essentially gives everyone the right jammer all the time every time and since currently ecm is dominating electronic warfare this just makes it betterthis could work but must have a very long recalibration time like 60s or greater so its not an instant ha im always ready for anything falcons are even better ha ha an rp reason against this is that the sensors on different races ships are based on completely different technology and would require different mechanical parts and physical hardware thus the different jammerspersonally i think the rp reasons outweigh the convenience provided by your suggestion the versatility of the multies comes at a cost of diminished effectiveness and the reason ecm is chance based is that when it does hit it is 100 effective at taking a ship out of battle minus fof and sb rather than reducing its effective abilitiesin short ecm is currently the best form of ewar and would be terribly overpowered with this no support until rsd gets buffed or somethingoh and always use racials
ok i see what prompted your argument the difference between ecm and other ewar and the reasoning behind the balancersd target painting tracking disruption100 chance of hitting the targetxxx of effectively removing the target from battleecmxxx chance of hitting the target100 of effectively removing the target from battle
correct but this mod is instead of a tank and then its a chance based tank and ontop its racial so you need to fill all or as many as with  what you think you going to fight racials to have a chance on a successful jamm if you fail you will lose your ship most of the timeall other ew has 100 chance of success and will add to the total damage that is done indirectly or will lead to causing less damage but all will have a tank and only need to use 1 or 2 ew mods to be successful in their rolethe script idea wont make it to powerful as you cant change scripts when you cloaked and if what is mentioned before a calibration time before you can use this mod will be added the only advantage is that you can change your racial setup without docking
still problem is there is no rp explanation for ecm scripts different jammers are physically different from each other both mechanically and at a hardware level because of the extreme effectiveness and completeness of ecm there needs to be more limiting factors in its chance of working in fact chance is really the only factor either you did or did not fit the best module suited for the job
although this would be a good idea if it wouldnt make the jammers totally op itd be the same but being right all the time about your jammee is too muchout of balance
yes it is currently if you want to be prepared for everything you must fit either multispecs resulting in lower range and strength or one of each racial resulting in less meaningful trials thats why racials are in place  otherwise it would be edit surprise sex i fly ecm this would make me god in a griffin not fair at all
having the right module fitted stays the same only you dont need to dock to change iti dont know how old you are as i played when the jammers were not chance based you had the strength and they added up then  total jamm strength vs ship sensor strength  the only thing was to fit the right racials the basic idea of jamm instead of tank little damage output  scorp vs the other races tier 1 bss  vs good jamming as chance based did not existthis base idea does not add up any more as its old concept and after the invention of sensor script and damper scripts  range and locktimes  this old technology is due for an overhaul and racial script should be invented
speaking as a falcon pilot this really would be op a basic limit on my effectiveness is having to balance my loadout being able to weild 56 racials would be completely imbalanced
fix ecmecm is too powerful for 1 race each race should be able to have their own racial bonus and caldari get bonus to their race and multispecso amarr can use one type of racial ecm but get no bonus to others etc as it currently stands ecm is like having 9000 tracting disrupters and 9000 sensor dampners on youalso i would say ecm scripts 1 script for power and 1 for jamming time so scripts that jam you for 20 seconds have low power but scrits that simply break locks like ecm burst do have higher power
noone will ever use the jamming time script except perhaps against solo targets would are doomed anywayalso only someone whos never flow a jamming ship could say something as illinformed and incorrect as ecm is like having 9000 tracting disrupters and 9000 sensor dampners on you thats just utter nonsenseedit i have made an ew balance proposal
then i see more in a short range more strength or longer range less strength scripts for the multies so that you can use more powerful multie jammers on closer range so the risk also goes up as range does not save you as it does now when a cycle fails
its fine asis and this change would eliminate one of the balancing factors to jam setups not signed
horrible idea
i searched back a month worth of threads in here to try and find this and if i repost an issue i apologizeminmatar large artillery and battleships need a buff in the sniping department compared to similarly fit ships from other races artillery battleships pale in just about every single categoryminmatar large artilleryall weapons in have their proscons1 beam lasers pro never need to reload amazing tracking cons use lots of cap horrible falloff emtherm only damage2 railguns pro long range high capacity fast rate of fire cons bad tracking low damage low volley damage expkin only damage3 artillery pro high volley damage no cap high falloff cons horrible capacity horrible tracking horrible rate of fire horrible dps horrible rangehowever as a sniper gun the only attractive qualities are the high volley damage and no cap usage on the artillery in laggy fleet situations having a whole 10 rounds of ammo per gun on 1400mm autocannons is pretty ridiculous when you have to wait 20 minutes to reload the tracking on artillery wouldnt be too much of an issue either if it had the range to match it having 425mm railguns outperform 1400mm artillery in both categoriesis pretty badwhat i would like seen done would be an increase in the base damage modifier as well as a balance to artillery range and tracking to fit somewhere between beam lasers and railguns also doubling their capacity would be amazing their high volleylow rate of fire attribute is nice and is unique to artillery but the other stats need a boostminmatar battleshipstyphoon for a tier 1 battleship the typhoon can spit out ridiculous amounts of damage and still be able to have a decent tank it has the same midslows as the armor tanking megathrons and apocalypse and 8 weapon slots which no other tier 1 battleship has besides its inability to easily fit large artillery which i believe is intentional and dont think needs to be changed it is an amazing shiptempest the designer of this ship took the jack of all trades tradition a bit too far it has a sick dual projectile turret bonus and is basically an older rupturehurricane in battleship form however it decided to try and become some sort of tanking nightmare as well coupled with the problems with artillery discussed above the tempest has the worst range worst dps worst tracking and worst tank of all sniper battleships which is horrible for fleet fighting its a slingshot made of paper while the megathron rokh and apocalypse outshine it in every categorymaelstrom this ship could be a mean machine with autocannons and a good shield setup this thing will laugh as it melts ships at minmatar battleship 5 it out damages a similarlyfit tempest by only 66 which i guess is made up for by its tank however even with its abilities to fit on 8 tech 2 1400mm artillery with advanced weapon upgrades 5 it still gets overshadowed in fleet combat by the usual suspects when it comes to sniping the increase in price and training to barely outperform a tempest is not worth the costso for fleet setups none of the minmatar are very satisfactory module scripting and large artillery woes have doomed these ships for fleet combat overall a big boost to the tempest would make it a good sniper if artillery was also tweaked as far as a fleet ship is concerned the typhoon has its niche and so does the maelstrom as far as im concerned but the maelstrom might also need a little revision to mass in order to make it shine more in its role and fit inline with other minmatar shipsif you disagree please say so and why i understand that ccp wants to keep ships balanced in both pvp and pve environments and i only have really covered one aspect after seeing the apocalypse range change in february id like to see something similar to a minmatar battleship
i support myself imagine that
you missed this thread
whoops so i have is it still acceptable that my thread covers minmatar battleships and all large artillery the issues are in tandem
ill support this 
heres a radical idea why not instead boost the specifically madefor ships that have a sole class just for miningiow why create new ships to make useless barges even more obsolete when you could instead boost the lower bargesi actually do like your idea but i think it is ridiculous enough right now that battleships can outmine small barges no need for even more nonmining ships
i agree that barges should be upgraded before we start adding new ships to replace themif you dont want to risk taking your rigged hulk into 00 space no one will blame you but you could definately take your covetor instead rather than redesign a cruiser to take its placeyou mean how industrials are t1s and blockade runners are t2s of the same hull kinda like how barges are t1s and exhumers are t2scruisers are for combat if you are worried about combat then dont go mining in 00 alone take along a few friends since eve is a multiplayer game
the only useless barge is the procurer all other ones are utilized often and even though you can mine more with a battleship than a retriever the retriever can be bought insured and fit for under 10 mil adding a t2 mining cruiser would make low sec mining ops more enticing as a cruiser is much more survivable than a mining barge or exhumer there is so much ore in low sec and 00 just waiting to be mined but the risk factor is too great for most people so this might be incentive to push people out of empire
more people to kill in 00 i approve
there has been quite a bit of discussion about barsclubs in ambulation and the fact that players may be able to own them if in fact players can own bars i wanted to bring forth the idea of the owner of the bar being able to stream a real song into the game to be broadcasted throughout the establishment this would add some flavor to the scene as well as allow the owner to add some of his own taste after all if he pays good isk to maintain a bar shouldnt he be allowed some sort of freedom for customization of course there would be problems with explicit songs so perhaps the guests at the bar could vote down a song that came on so that the bartender doesnt blare baby got back all night anyway thats just the cool little thought i had obviously there will be a lot of potential problems with this but if this becomes popular enough im sure kinks could be worked out
the major kink i would see if the copyright issues for ccp so unless ccp find someway around that i cant support even if i would like to see it
please make bpcs have a different icon then bpos a simple transparency that puts a mark in the corner of bpc icons would make my life much easier after accidently grouping together 1000 mixed bpos and bpcs i thought i would die before trying to sort them all out
yes please make them different green  copy  and blue  original or anything so you can see the difference
yes please  is it too hard to put a c in a corner kinda of like how you mark bps for tech 2
i would love this but its not possible according to lingorm
not without much work truebut if their database cant compete with todays requirements its time to redesign itthe current issue cant remain that way forever its ridiculous
and when they change the database this is one thing id love to see fixed but until they do we get to suffer through having to show info every time
this has been explained hundred of times beforeif its that much of a problem use the science and industry interface it has the the copy  original filter built right in
i often have this issue and end up turning off the module i intended to turn off i also like the suggestion of a cycle indicator for modules

telling people to get learning skills out of the way during the trial so they are ready to play the game when the trial ends is pretty funny considering you know theyll be training skills the entire time they are playing the game also considering that having only trained learning skills they actually wont be ready to play the game if we accept the belief that noobs start with too few skills to do anythinganyone dumb enough to train learning skills so early they dont even have enough basic skills to enjoy the lower levels of the game deserves it im not sure if this is even possible to do anymore with the noob sp boost dont they start a stones throw from t2 frigates these days assuming they combat spec ofcanyone so impatient that they are unwilling to wait a month for an entire set of skills to finish training are going to be very disappointed when they find there are single l5s that take a month or more

yes you should be able do disable this especially since i would hope that it would enable you to disable the devgm spam that occurs sometimes using the same msg window i really hate it when they spam things multiple times like when the pvp tourney is about to be broadcast or some such seriously it was already posted on the forums and the login news screen if i cared i got the info already if i didnt your just annoying me even worse one of these stupid pop dialogs informing me that the live dev blog was about to begin actually caused my ship to pop since it had to be acknowledgedclicked before any other ui commands could be entered
i wholeheartedly agree this should be a feature when a split second can make the difference between a smoking ship and a floating pod these popups can be a killer yes voice of experience thereunfortunately you will never get them to do it i have discussed this very item with a gm live and his response was the time warning screens are a very useful tool in our fight against macros they are unlikely to change any time soon typical ccp bullyes we need the ablity to turn them off but good luck on getting ccp to do itcheers
modal windows are nasty
i understand your point but it does seem good against macros sorry but im split
i hadnt thought about it being good against macros but i would think that if a gmdev targetted an individual with such a pop up window then it should bypass the off toggleor it could be set up that way for just mass general information spammage though we should be able to turn it off
while asteroid belts were removed from jita over a year ago agents still remain jita contains 7 level 1 agents 7 level 2s and 3 level 3s no one with the faintest spark of intelligence is using them and anyone who is should be kicked in the junk its plenty clear by now what jita is used for so kill the agents same goes for any neighboring systems that would bleed over please
contracting damaged goods should have been an option from the beginning of the contract system and not only for this reason
agreed

nevermind use the dev finder under forums im dumb and didnt know about this tool
definately would be a good thing especially if the issue in question is one that could be resolved with a quick yesnoalready answered in topic link answer
do you realise that intentionally devs dont post here in the assembly hall this is the players area so they strive to leave it to the players to control exception being to the posting of the meeting notes of the csm meeting in iceland its multithreaded interlinkage was something that only someone with board adminmod powers could have constructedas to your idea being put in place for other subsections of the forums besides the assembly hall while i think it would be nice to have i think in the long run it would just be a self decepetion to us the player base having 1st response post of every thread created would lead players to think they are entitled to a dev response for every post on every subjectidea world i see this working here on eveo it would just become a mass cluster  id rather see the dev finder feature updated more frequently 12hr turn around would be great i think this coupled with an actually functioning search feature would achieve most of what your after and be more worthwhile in the endtldr  no not worth it in the long run
not appropriate to the forum and if the dev really does want to say something op can just edit the op to link it
off topiclocked
no  it is an isk sink and not a signifigant oneit would be used to make playing dockundock games free and dockundock games are gay
it is an isk sink and the repair bay wont go awayfor one thing its much quicker to pay the fee and fly off than it is to wait for the reppers to work their magicalso reppers dont work on modules or drones so you still have to pay to get those repairedarguing against this topic is pretty silly anyways pilots either fit reppers or carry them onboard they dock long enough to swap them out then float right outside the station and repair for free anyways so theres no difference between allowing it just outside and allowing it inside the repair bay isnt getting your isk either way
people seriously stop with this here here nonsense its hear hear in an era before microphones it was easy for a speaker in parliament to be drowned outfor that matter in an era with microphones speakers are still often drowned out and as such his supporters would often yell hear him hear him or simply hear hear to call attention to his words the short version is far more common today of course but it still nonetheless refers to an action and not a location
theyre merry and lively well if you say so i always thought they were lame and annoying myselfi like the original idea though
this would be very nice

non constructive and not an issue for the csm its assembly hall spam lock please

i do agree that launching dds should require them going into some variation of a dreads seige modeindeed id not even mind if a dd were made even more powerful if there was that requirement
they already have their cant warp thing right besides this still doesnt stop them from launching multiple and just sitting there assuming any opposing force has been killedmake ddd like a big sb with a diminishing effect from increased radius set medium range 40km to take the current amount of damage anything closer is almost guaranteed to die anything further takes less damage 100150km snipers should still get hurt but once we get to 200 only paper airplanes should be getting poppedships shouldnt be able to dock  it will turn into station games give them refit bonuses and jump portal anything that a pos could do really give them a few more guns too why not make them just as super awesome but in different less gamebreaking categories
not supported because thisi agree local can stay as it is although it would be nice if ccp wrote a backstory scientific article on this omnipotent system scanner that can determine pilot identity from ship signature if only for rp reasons zis would be a fair compromise no just say it i like crepes
x the ninja salvager should be aggrod to the mission runner after the first wreck is salvaged because the mission runner owns the wrecks and i feel that ccp needs to change the current dynamic
no you are terrible ebile people
if mission runners ever own the wrecks then ninja salvagers will inevitably own them
by all means please do  that would be a change id be happy to be associated withbecause you see the only change is that the option to defend what you see as yours would now be present as to the rest  that can happen any time under the current system just take one single module from a wreck and youre flagged the choice of aggro or not is entirely up to the salvagerim not worried in the least about all the sky is falling and theyre invading my mission space repercussions those can exist right now at the desire of the salvager the fact that it happens only seldom tells me that it will likely to continue to happen only seldom even if there is a changeso yes i think its a fine change and am happy to stand behind my support for it and any possible repercussions from itwhile you may disagree with that position i hope that at least you can respect that it is honestly held honestly stated and that i will back it up
with a name like that id love to agree with you but i cant i dont mind the 30 day skills i dont even mind the 50 day skills its just such a damn good feeling when you get the skill training completed on one of those monsters personally id rather we bring back the old days when you needed level v in a skill to take the advanced skills which followed or to fly the advanced ships dependent upon it
i dont remember exactly but when the advanced learning skills were introduced didnt you have to close out your basic skill before you could even start the advanced ones and somewhere down the road ccp relaxed the requirements a bit to make it easier
correct
what about the maraudors they were never needed for doing missions but still they implemented a ship which could both do the missions with ease and salavge the whole lot and loot with its awesomly large cargoholdtraveling becomes a pain when you need to move more than one ship around over longer distances for just that one purpose of doing exploration sites having a ship that does both can be awesome without being unbalanced as long as it is not made unbalanced a ship that could do a 1010 complex and also scan its location is not desireable bit for use in low sec and high sec i see it a a good ideaplayers may even want to use a covert ship over a potential new ship because if this kind of ship should be balanced it wouldnt be as effecient as the covert ofc
sounds interesting
of course exploring with a partner who flys something ready to do a little combat on rats really helpsi explore and use a helios i have never minded the swapping shipssince i mostly have a wingperson with me when i scan out sites placement of probes for optimum coverage is easy with a little practice if one also remembers that moons can also be flown tooexploring carries risks and has good rewards it shouldnt be a way to make fast and easy iskies by introducing a explorationcombat shiparithron
and the worst thing is that no one really wanted to destroy speed and nanos they want the ability if they fit for it to counter it without nanoing themselvessuch as by fixing webifiers there needs to be a long range but much lower speed reduction webifierinstead amongst the changes is a 50 nerf to web strength with no increase in rangestupid very stupid did i mention the proposal is stupid
i said this in your other thread eleanor the speed nerf is not final they put alot of changes on the test server to see which ones worked and which ones break the game this will be a multistep process dont  yourself
the csm are showing their worthhopefully theyll continue to do so and ignore the babies whod rather whine and cry than adapt to the games changes
yet people keep bugging us ingame about it i cant count the amount of convoes i have gotten because of it and people are always disappointed in my answer edit and oh very few people actually seemed to actually read the very first line of the devblog
i guess bright yellow wasnt good enough next time they should try red or something maybe a rainbow  that would get peoples attention
nano nerf gets a thumb down from me
well they gotta make their money somehow when people quit the game from a nerdrage at the nanonerf
balancing shouldnt be a csm issue unless its gamebreaking as stated alreadyi would like to see more csm member views on this topic
since i sent out an email to all council members when i posted this post i am not happy eitherso i sent another mail and created a thread over here which will hopefully make them post
ship balancing issues as lavista rightly points out is just one of the smaller issues that takes up a lot of time for the csmship balancing imo can never be 100 perfect for all of the eve players due to the fact that a player can have characters in any of 4 races with secondary racial characteristics this means that ccp gives each race exactly the same set of ships ignoring racial differences which would result in some races getting better bonuses in some areas and others in different areas or it tries as it has to take account of the strengths of a race and cater ships towards thosethis means that straight off before skills are taken into affect there is a spectrum of different ships that will each suit different types of players within each class of ship for each race there is further possible variation depending on the skills of the character and modulefittinguse ability rigs etc etcessentially there are many possible types of final ship types depending on a character type and skills etc it then follows that there will be major differences between the ship of a certain race class and that of a different race of the same classthis is all kept continuous ingame via the storyline with different corps producing the types of ships for each race each ship with its strengths and weaknessesthe problem comes when a player designs a ship they think will do well against other ships only to find that another ship has an advantage in an area they have overlookedessentially the shipbalancing calls place the csm and ccp in a nowin situation players want an ubership that can hold its own and defeat other ships we dont like it when we overlook something and are made to pay the price on the battlefieldanyone watching tourney battles will quickly come to the conclusion that certain ship types are useful in certain situations there is no one answerits essentially like cars in real life each is made to do or fulfil different functions they all look different and have different attributes they even are made by different designers and manufacturersthe betterness of one type over another depends upon how they are employed and who is using them and the situation they are used withini personally dont think the csm should be used as a portal for ships to be tweaked to make them better or like another ship there is a place for it its called the features and ideas discussion forumedit i dont think balancing is needed unless there is some major area that is not working as intended eg speed variety as they say is the spice of lifearithron
